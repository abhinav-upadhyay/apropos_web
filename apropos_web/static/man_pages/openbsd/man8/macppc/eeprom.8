.Sh NAME
.Nm eeprom
.Nd display or modify contents of the EEPROM or OpenPROM
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm eeprom
.Op Fl cipv
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Oo
.Ar field Ns Op = Ns Ar value
.Ar ...

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm eeprom
provides an interface for displaying and changing the contents of the
EEPROM or OpenPROM.
Without any arguments,
.Nm eeprom
will list all of the known fields and their corresponding values.
When given the name of a specific field,
.Nm eeprom
will display that value or set it if the field name is followed by
.Sq =
and a value.
Only the superuser may modify the contents of the EEPROM or OpenPROM.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl
Commands are taken from stdin and displayed on stdout.
.It Fl c
.Nm eeprom
will fix incorrect checksum values and exit.
This flag is quietly ignored on systems with an OpenPROM.
.It Fl f Ar device
On systems with an EEPROM, use
.Ar device
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/eeprom .
On systems with an OpenPROM, use
.Ar device
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/openprom .
.It Fl i
If checksum values are incorrect,
.Nm eeprom
will ignore them and continue after displaying a warning.
This flag is quietly ignored on systems with an OpenPROM.
.It Fl N Ar system
Use the system image
.Ar system
instead of the default
.Pa /bsd .
.It Fl p
On systems with an OpenPROM, display the tree derived from it and exit.
This flag is quietly ignored on systems with an EEPROM.
.It Fl v
On systems with an OpenPROM, be verbose when setting a value.
Systems with an EEPROM are always verbose.
.El
.Sh FIELDS AND VALUES
The following fields and values are for systems with an EEPROM:
.Bl -tag -width "watchdog_reboot  "
.It Ar hwupdate
A valid date, such as
.Dq 7/12/95 .
The strings
.Dq today
and
.Dq now
are also acceptable.
.It Ar memsize
How much memory, in megabytes, is installed in the system.

.It Ar default_boot
If true, the system will use the boot device stored in
.Ar bootdev .
.It Ar bootdev
Specifies the default boot device in the form cc(x,x,x), where
.Dq cc
is a combination of two letters such as

of the default Sun banner.
.El
.Pp
Note that the
.Ar secure ,
.Ar bad_login ,
and
.Ar password
fields are not currently supported.
.Pp
Since the OpenPROM is designed such that the field names are arbitrary,
explaining them here is dubious.
Below are field names and values that
one is likely to see on a system with an OpenPROM.
NOTE: this list
may be incomplete or incorrect due to differences between revisions
of the OpenPROM.
.Bl -tag -width "last-hardware-update  "
.It Ar sunmon-compat?
If true, the old EEPROM-style interface will be used while in the monitor,
rather than the OpenPROM-style interface.
.It Ar selftest-#megs
A 32-bit integer specifying the number of megabytes of memory to
test upon power-up.
.It Ar oem-logo
A 64bitx64bit bitmap in Sun Iconedit format.
To set the bitmap, give the pathname of the file containing the image.
NOTE: this property is not yet supported.
.It Ar oem-logo?
If true, enables the use of the bitmap stored in
.Ar oem-logo
rather than the default Sun logo.
.It Ar oem-banner
A string to use at power-up, rather than the default Sun banner.
.It Ar oem-banner?
If true, enables the use of the banner stored in
.Ar oem-banner
rather than the default Sun banner.
.It Ar ttya-mode
A string of five comma separated fields in the format
.Dq 9600,8,n,1,- .
The first field is the baud rate.
The second field is the number of data bits.
The third field is the parity; acceptable values for parity are
.Dq n
(none),
.Dq e
(even),
.Dq o
(odd),
.Dq m
(mark), and
.Dq s
(space).
The fourth field is the number of stop bits.
The fifth field is the
.Dq handshake
field; acceptable values are
.Dq -
(none),
.Dq h
(RTS/CTS), and
.Dq s
(XON/XOFF).
.It Ar ttya-rts-dtr-off
If true, the system will ignore RTS/DTR.
.It Ar ttya-ignore-cd
If true, the system will ignore carrier detect.
.It Ar ttyb-mode
Similar to
.Ar ttya-mode ,

.It Ar ttyb-ignore-cd
Similar to
.Ar ttya-ignore-cd ,
but for ttyb.
.It Ar sbus-probe-list
Four digits in the format
.Dq 0123
specifying which order to probe the SBus at power-up.
It is unlikely that this value should ever be changed.
.It Ar screen-#columns
An 8-bit integer specifying the number of columns on the console.
.It Ar screen-#rows
An 8-bit integer specifying the number of rows on the console.
.It Ar auto-boot?
If true, the system will boot automatically at power-up.
.It Ar watchdog-reboot?
If true, the system will reboot upon reset.
Otherwise, the system will fall into the monitor.
.It Ar input-device
One of the strings
.Dq keyboard ,
.Dq ttya ,
or
.Dq ttyb
specifying the default console input device.
.It Ar output-device
One of the strings
.Dq screen ,
.Dq ttya ,
or
.Dq ttyb
specifying the default console output device.
.It Ar keyboard-click?
If true, the keys click annoyingly.
.It Ar sd-targets
A string in the format
.Dq 31204567
describing the translation of physical to logical target.
.It Ar st-targets
Similar to
.Ar sd-targets ,
but for tapes.
The default translation is
.Dq 45670123 .
.It Ar scsi-initiator-id
The SCSI ID of the on-board SCSI controller.
.It Ar hardware-revision
A 7-character string describing a date, such as
.Dq 25May95 .
.It Ar last-hardware-update
Similar to
.Ar hardware-revision ,
describing when the CPU was last updated.
.It Ar diag-switch?
If true, the system will boot and run in diagnostic mode.
.It Ar local-mac-address?
When set to
.Em false ,
all Ethernet devices will use the same system default MAC address.
When
.Em true ,
Ethernet devices which have a unique MAC address will use it
rather than the system default MAC address.
This option only really affects FCode-based Ethernet devices.
In reality,
this means that on Sparc machines with an OpenPROM,
only
.Xr hme 4
Ethernet devices respect this setting.
On Sparc64, all on-board devices,
as well as plug-in
.Xr hme 4
boards, will respect this setting;
other hardware will not.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/openprom" -compact
.It /dev/eeprom
the EEPROM device on systems with an EEPROM
.It /dev/openprom
the OpenPROM device on systems with an OpenPROM
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr openprom 4
.Sh CAVEATS
The fields and their values are not necessarily well defined on
systems with an OpenPROM.
Your mileage may vary.
.Pp
There are a few fields known to exist in some revisions of the EEPROM
and/or OpenPROM that are not yet supported.
Most notable are those
relating to password protection of the EEPROM or OpenPROM.
.Pp
Avoid gratuitously changing the contents of the EEPROM.
It has a limited number of write cycles.
.Pp
The date parser isn't very intelligent.
