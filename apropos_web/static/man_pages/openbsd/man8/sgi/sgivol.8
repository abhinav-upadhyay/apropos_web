.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to initialise and manipulate SGI disk volume headers.
.Pp
The SGI volume header is a disklabel-like structure located at the
start of a disk.
It is typically 3135 (512-byte) blocks in size, and can store a
variety of files inside it, typically boot programs.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag_opt
.It Fl d Ar vhfilename
Delete the file
.Ar vhfilename
from the filesystem storage space in the volume header.
.It Fl h Ar vhsize
Choose an alternate volume header size, in (512-byte) disk blocks.
The default is 3135 blocks.
.It Fl i
Initialise a volume header on the supplied device.
.It Fl l Ar vhfilename1 Ar vhfilename2
Link the file
.Ar vhfilename1
to the file
.Ar vhfilename2
within the filesystem storage space in the volume header.
.It Fl q
Be quiet about various diagnostic issues.
.It Fl r Ar vhfilename Ar diskfilename
Locate the file
.Ar vhfilename
in the storage space of the volume header, and copy it to the
standard file
.Ar diskfilename .
.It Fl w Ar vhfilename Ar diskfilename
Copy the standard file
.Ar diskfilename
to the filesystem storage space in the volume header, placing
it there with the name
.Ar vhfilename .
.It Ar disk
The name of the disk containing the partition in which the second-stage
boot program resides and the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
This can either be specified in short form (e.g.,
.Sq sd0
or as the explicit device node, such as
.Pa /dev/rsd0c ) .
.Pp
Note that you must be in single-user mode or have your kernel in
insecure mode (see the
.Xr sysctl 8
.Va kern.securelevel
variable or
.Pa /etc/rc.securelevel )
to enable access to the raw partition of a mounted disk.
.El
.Pp
If no special flags are supplied,
.Nm
will display the current volume header information.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The typical use is
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# /usr/mdec/sgivol -i sd0
# /usr/mdec/sgivol -w boot /usr/mdec/boot sd0
