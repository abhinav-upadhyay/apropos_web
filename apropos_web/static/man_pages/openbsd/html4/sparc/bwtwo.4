.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a black and white frame buffer commonly encountered
as the on-board frame buffer on sun4 and some sun4c class workstations.
It is also available as an SBus card for sun4c, sun4e and sun4m, or as a P4 bus
card for sun4 workstations.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
