.Dt TSLOT 4 sparc
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tslot
.Nd Tadpole PCMCIA Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tslot0 at sbus?"
.Cd "pcmcia* at tslot?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver manages the
.Xr pcmcia 4
controller part of the
.Xr tctrl 4
.Tn Tadpole
TS102 controller found on the
.Tn Tadpole SPARCbook
3 series laptops.
It provides two PCMCIA slots and can receive up to two PCMCIA type 1
or type 2 cards, or one PCMCIA type 3 card.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pcmcia 4 ,
.Xr sbus 4 ,
.Xr tctrl 4
.Sh CAVEATS
Due to hardware limitations, it is not possible to run a 3.3V card and a 5V
card at the same time.
.Sh BUGS
Unlike other PCMCIA adapters which are little-endian, this bridge
provides a big-endian
.Xr pcmcia 4
bus.
Therefore, 16 bit drivers need to be made aware of this before they will
work.
