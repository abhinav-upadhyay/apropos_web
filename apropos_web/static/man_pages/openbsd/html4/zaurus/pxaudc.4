.Sh NAME
.Nm pxaudc
.Nd PXA27x USB device controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pxaudc0 at pxaip?"
.Cd "usbf* at pxaudc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The PXA27x USB Device Controller supplies bus interface functions
so that
the USB Function support driver,
.Xr usbf 4 ,
can support client-cable USB functions.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver is able to detect the presence of either host or client cables.
If a host cable is detected, the USB pins are routed to
the USB host controller,
.Xr ohci 4 ,
which supplies USB device support for many devices as described in
.Xr usb 4 .
If a client cable is detected, the USB pins are directly used by
.Nm
to support USB client functionality, as described in
.Xr usbf 4 .
