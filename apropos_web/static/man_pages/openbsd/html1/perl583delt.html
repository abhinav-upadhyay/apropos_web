<h1>NAME</h1> perl583delta - what is new for perl v5.8.3</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.8.2 release and the 5.8.3 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.6.1, first read the perl58delta, which describes differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0, and the perl581delta and perl582delta, which describe differences between 5.8.0, 5.8.1 and 5.8.2</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1> There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.2.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1> A &quot;SCALAR&quot; method is now available for tied hashes. This is called when a tied hash is used in scalar context, such as<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    if (%tied_hash) {<br/>
        ...<br/>
    }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The old behaviour was that %tied_hash would return whatever would have been returned for that hash before the hash was tied (so usually 0). The new behaviour in the absence of a SCALAR method is to return TRUE if in the middle of an &quot;each&quot; iteration, and otherwise call FIRSTKEY to check if the hash is empty (making sure that a subsequent &quot;each&quot; will also begin by calling FIRSTKEY). Please see &quot;SCALAR&quot; in perltie for the full details and caveats.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Utility Changes</h1> &quot;find2perl&quot; now assumes &quot;-print&quot; as a default action. Previously, it needed to be specified explicitly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A new utility, &quot;prove&quot;, makes it easy to run an individual regression test at the command line. &quot;prove&quot; is part of Test::Harness, which users of earlier Perl versions can install from CPAN.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>New Documentation</h1> The documentation has been revised in places to produce more standard manpages.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The documentation for the special code blocks (BEGIN, CHECK, INIT, END) has been improved.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Installation and Configuration Improvements</h1> Perl now builds on OpenVMS I64</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Selected Bug Fixes</h1> Using  <i>substr()</i> on a UTF8 string could cause subsequent accesses on that string to return garbage. This was due to incorrect UTF8 offsets being cached, and is now fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>join()</i> could return garbage when the same <i>join()</i> statement was used to process 8 bit data having earlier processed UTF8 data, due to the flags on that statement's temporary workspace not being reset correctly. This is now fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;$a .. $b&quot; will now work as expected when either $a or $b is &quot;undef&quot;<div class="spacer">
</div>
Using Unicode keys with tied hashes should now work correctly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Reading $^E now preserves $!. Previously, the C code implementing $^E did not preserve &quot;errno&quot;, so reading $^E could cause &quot;errno&quot; and therefore $! to change unexpectedly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Reentrant functions will (once more) work with C++. 5.8.2 introduced a bugfix which accidentally broke the compilation of Perl extensions written in C++</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>New or Changed Diagnostics</h1> The fatal error &quot;DESTROY created new reference to dead object&quot; is now documented in perldiag.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Changed Internals</h1> The hash code has been refactored to reduce source duplication. The external interface is unchanged, and aside from the bug fixes described above, there should be no change in behaviour.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;hv_clear_placeholders&quot; is now part of the perl API<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some C macros have been tidied. In particular macros which create temporary local variables now name these variables more defensively, which should avoid bugs where names clash.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&lt;signal.h&gt; is now always included.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Configuration and Building</h1> &quot;Configure&quot; now invokes callbacks regardless of the value of the variable they are called for. Previously callbacks were only invoked in the &quot;case $variable $define)&quot; branch. This change should only affect platform maintainers writing configuration hints files.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Platform Specific Problems</h1> The regression test ext/threads/shared/t/wait.t fails on early RedHat 9 and HP-UX 10.20 due to bugs in their threading implementations. RedHat users should see https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2003-136.html and consider upgrading their glibc.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Known Problems</h1> Detached threads aren't supported on Windows yet, as they may lead to memory access violation problems.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is a known race condition opening scripts in &quot;suidperl&quot;. &quot;suidperl&quot; is neither built nor installed by default, and has been deprecated since perl 5.8.0. You are advised to replace use of suidperl with tools such as sudo ( http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ )<div class="spacer">
</div>
We have a backlog of unresolved bugs. Dealing with bugs and bug reports is unglamorous work; not something ideally suited to volunteer labour, but that is all that we have.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The perl5 development team are implementing changes to help address this problem, which should go live in early 2004.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Future Directions</h1> Code freeze for the next maintenance release (5.8.4) is on March 31st 2004, with release expected by mid April. Similarly 5.8.5's freeze will be at the end of June, with release by mid July.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Obituary</h1> Iain 'Spoon' Truskett, Perl hacker, author of perlreref and contributor to CPAN, died suddenly on 29th December 2003, aged 24. He will be missed.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://bugs.perl.org.  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.  You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at http://bugs.perl.org/</div>
