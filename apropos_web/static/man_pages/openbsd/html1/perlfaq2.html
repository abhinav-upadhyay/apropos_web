<h1>NAME</h1> perlfaq2 - Obtaining and Learning about Perl</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This section of the FAQ answers questions about where to find source and documentation for Perl, support, and related matters.<div class="subsection">
<h2>What machines support Perl? Where do I get it?</h2> The standard release of Perl (the one maintained by the Perl development team) is distributed only in source code form. You can find the latest releases at &lt;http://www.cpan.org/src/&gt;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of platforms. Virtually all known and current Unix derivatives are supported (perl's native platform), as are other systems like VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows, QNX, BeOS, OS X, MPE/iX and the Amiga.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms can be found &lt;http://www.cpan.org/ports/&gt; directory. Because these are not part of the standard distribution, they may and in fact do differ from the base perl port in a variety of ways. You'll have to check their respective release notes to see just what the differences are. These differences can be either positive (e.g. extensions for the features of the particular platform that are not supported in the source release of perl) or negative (e.g. might be based upon a less current source release of perl).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How can I get a binary version of Perl?</h2> See CPAN Ports &lt;http://www.cpan.org/ports/&gt;</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>I don't have a C compiler. How can I build my own Perl interpreter?</h2> For Windows, use a binary version of Perl, Strawberry Perl &lt;http://strawberryperl.com/&gt; and ActivePerl &lt;http://www.activestate.com/activeperl&gt; come with a bundled C compiler.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Otherwise if you really do want to build Perl, you need to get a binary version of &quot;gcc&quot; for your system first. Use a search engine to find out how to do this for your operating system.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>I copied the Perl binary from one machine to another, but scripts don't work.</h2> That's probably because you forgot libraries, or library paths differ. You really should build the whole distribution on the machine it will eventually live on, and then type &quot;make install&quot;. Most other approaches are doomed to failure.<div class="spacer">
</div>
One simple way to check that things are in the right place is to print out the hard-coded @INC that perl looks through for libraries:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    % perl -le 'print for @INC'<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If this command lists any paths that don't exist on your system, then you may need to move the appropriate libraries to these locations, or create symbolic links, aliases, or shortcuts appropriately. @INC is also printed as part of the output of<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    % perl -V<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You might also want to check out &quot;How do I keep my own module/library directory?&quot; in perlfaq8.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>I grabbed the sources and tried to compile but gdbm/dynamic loading/malloc/linking/... failed. How do I make it work?</h2> Read the  <i>INSTALL</i> file, which is part of the source distribution. It describes in detail how to cope with most idiosyncrasies that the &quot;Configure&quot; script can't work around for any given system or architecture.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>What modules and extensions are available for Perl? What is CPAN?</h2> CPAN stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a multi-gigabyte archive replicated on hundreds of machines all over the world. CPAN contains tens of thousands of modules and extensions, source code and documentation, designed for  <i>everything</i> from commercial database interfaces to keyboard/screen control and running large web sites.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can search CPAN on &lt;http://metacpan.org&gt; or &lt;http://search.cpan.org/&gt;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The master web site for CPAN is &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, &lt;http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html&gt; lists all mirrors.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the CPAN FAQ at &lt;http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html&gt; for answers to the most frequently asked questions about CPAN.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Task::Kensho module has a list of recommended modules which you should review as a good starting point.</div>

The complete Perl documentation is available with the Perl distribution. If you have Perl installed locally, you probably have the documentation installed as well: type &quot;perldoc perl&quot; in a terminal or view online &lt;http://perldoc.perl.org/perl.html&gt;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
(Some operating system distributions may ship the documentation in a different package; for instance, on Debian, you need to install the &quot;perl-doc&quot; package.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Many good books have been written about Perl--see the section later in perlfaq2 for more details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>What is perl.com? Perl Mongers? pm.org? perl.org? cpan.org?</h2> Perl.com &lt;http://www.perl.com/&gt; used to be part of the O'Reilly Network, a subsidiary of O'Reilly Media. Although it retains most of the original content from its O'Reilly Network, it is now hosted by The Perl Foundation &lt;http://www.perlfoundation.org/&gt;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Perl Foundation is an advocacy organization for the Perl language which maintains the web site &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt; as a general advocacy site for the Perl language. It uses the domain to provide general support services to the Perl community, including the hosting of mailing lists, web sites, and other services. There are also many other sub-domains for special topics like learning Perl and jobs in Perl, such as:<dl>

</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl Mongers &lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt; uses the pm.org domain for services related to local Perl user groups, including the hosting of mailing lists and web sites. See the Perl Mongers web site &lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt; for more information about joining, starting, or requesting services for a Perl user group.<div class="spacer">
</div>
CPAN, or the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, is a replicated, worldwide repository of Perl software. See What is CPAN?.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Where can I post questions?</h2> There are many Perl mailing lists for various topics, specifically the beginners list &lt;http://lists.perl.org/list/beginners.html&gt; may be of use.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Other places to ask questions are on the PerlMonks site &lt;http://www.perlmonks.org/&gt; or stackoverflow &lt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/perl&gt;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Perl Books</h2> There are many good books on Perl &lt;http://www.perl.org/books/library.html&gt;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Which magazines have Perl content?</h2> There's also  <i></i><i>$foo</i><i> Magazin</i>, a German magazine dedicated to Perl, at ( &lt;http://www.foo-magazin.de&gt; ). The  <i>Perl-Zeitung</i> is another German-speaking magazine for Perl beginners (see &lt;http://perl-zeitung.at.tf&gt; ).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Several unix/linux releated magazines frequently includes articles on Perl.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Which Perl blogs should I read?</h2> Perl News &lt;http://perlnews.org/&gt; covers some of the major events in the Perl world, Perl Weekly &lt;http://perlweekly.com/&gt; is a weekly e-mail (and RSS feed) of hand-picked Perl articles.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&lt;http://blogs.perl.org/&gt; hosts many Perl blogs, there are also several blog aggregators: Perlsphere &lt;http://perlsphere.net/&gt; and IronMan &lt;http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/&gt; are two of them.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>What mailing lists are there for Perl?</h2> A comprehensive list of Perl-related mailing lists can be found at &lt;http://lists.perl.org/&gt;</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Where can I buy a commercial version of Perl?</h2> Perl already  <i>is</i> commercial software: it has a license that you can grab and carefully read to your manager. It is distributed in releases and comes in well-defined packages. There is a very large and supportive user community and an extensive literature.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you still need commercial support ActiveState &lt;http://www.activestate.com/activeperl&gt; offers this.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Where do I send bug reports?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
First, ensure that you've found an actual bug. Second, ensure you've found an actual bug.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you've found a bug with the perl interpreter or one of the modules in the standard library (those that come with Perl), you can use the perlbug utility that comes with Perl (&gt;= 5.004). It collects information about your installation to include with your message, then sends the message to the right place.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To determine if a module came with your version of Perl, you can install and use the Module::CoreList module. It has the information about the modules (with their versions) included with each release of Perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Every CPAN module has a bug tracker set up in RT, &lt;http://rt.cpan.org&gt;. You can submit bugs to RT either through its web interface or by email. To email a bug report, send it to bug-&lt;distribution-name&gt;@rt.cpan.org . For example, if you wanted to report a bug in Business::ISBN, you could send a message to bug-Business-ISBN@rt.cpan.org .<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some modules might have special reporting requirements, such as a Github or Google Code tracking system, so you should check the module documentation too.</div>
