<h1>NAME</h1> perl5160delta - what is new for perl v5.16.0</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.14.0 release and the 5.16.0 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and 5.14.0.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some bug fixes in this release have been backported to later releases of 5.14.x.  Those are indicated with the 5.14.x version in parentheses.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Notice</h1> With the release of Perl 5.16.0, the 5.12.x series of releases is now out of its support period.  There may be future 5.12.x releases, but only in the event of a critical security issue.  Users of Perl 5.12 or earlier should consider upgrading to a more recent release of Perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This policy is described in greater detail in perlpolicy.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;use <i>VERSION</i>&quot;</h2> As of this release, version declarations like &quot;use v5.16&quot; now disable all features before enabling the new feature bundle.  This means that the following holds true:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use 5.016;<br/>
    # only 5.16 features enabled here<br/>
    use 5.014;<br/>
    # only 5.14 features enabled here (not 5.16)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;use v5.12&quot; and higher continue to enable strict, but explicit &quot;use strict&quot; and &quot;no strict&quot; now override the version declaration, even when they come first:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    no strict;<br/>
    use 5.012;<br/>
    # no strict here<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is a new &quot;:default&quot; feature bundle that represents the set of features enabled before any version declaration or &quot;use feature&quot; has been seen.  Version declarations below 5.10 now enable the &quot;:default&quot; feature set.  This does not actually change the behavior of &quot;use v5.8&quot;, because features added to the &quot;:default&quot; set are those that were traditionally enabled by default, before they could be turned off.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;no feature&quot; now resets to the default feature set.  To disable all features (which is likely to be a pretty special-purpose request, since it presumably won't match any named set of semantics) you can now write &quot;no feature ':all'&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
$[ is now disabled under &quot;use v5.16&quot;.  It is part of the default feature set and can be turned on or off explicitly with &quot;use feature 'array_base'&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;__SUB__&quot;</h2> The new &quot;__SUB__&quot; token, available under the &quot;current_sub&quot; feature (see feature) or &quot;use v5.16&quot;, returns a reference to the current subroutine, making it easier to write recursive closures.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New and Improved Built-ins</h2>  <i>More consistent </i><i>&quot;eval&quot;</i><i></i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;eval&quot; operator sometimes treats a string argument as a sequence of characters and sometimes as a sequence of bytes, depending on the internal encoding.  The internal encoding is not supposed to make any difference, but there is code that relies on this inconsistency.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The new &quot;unicode_eval&quot; and &quot;evalbytes&quot; features (enabled under &quot;use 5.16.0&quot;) resolve this.  The &quot;unicode_eval&quot; feature causes &quot;eval $string&quot; to treat the string always as Unicode.  The &quot;evalbytes&quot; features provides a function, itself called &quot;evalbytes&quot;, which evaluates its argument always as a string of bytes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These features also fix oddities with source filters leaking to outer dynamic scopes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See feature for more detail.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><i>&quot;substr&quot;</i><i> lvalue revamp</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
When &quot;substr&quot; is called in lvalue or potential lvalue context with two or three arguments, a special lvalue scalar is returned that modifies the original string (the first argument) when assigned to.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Previously, the offsets (the second and third arguments) passed to &quot;substr&quot; would be converted immediately to match the string, negative offsets being translated to positive and offsets beyond the end of the string being truncated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now, the offsets are recorded without modification in the special lvalue scalar that is returned, and the original string is not even looked at by &quot;substr&quot; itself, but only when the returned lvalue is read or modified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These changes result in an incompatible change:<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the original string changes length after the call to &quot;substr&quot; but before assignment to its return value, negative offsets will remember their position from the end of the string, affecting code like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    my $string = &quot;string&quot;;<br/>
    my $lvalue = \substr $string, -4, 2;<br/>
    print $$lvalue, &quot;\n&quot;; # prints &quot;ri&quot;<br/>
    $string = &quot;bailing twine&quot;;<br/>
    print $$lvalue, &quot;\n&quot;; # prints &quot;wi&quot;; used to print &quot;il&quot;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The same thing happens with an omitted third argument.  The returned lvalue will always extend to the end of the string, even if the string becomes longer.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since this change also allowed many bugs to be fixed (see &quot;The &quot;substr&quot; operator&quot;), and since the behavior of negative offsets has never been specified, the change was deemed acceptable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Return value of </i><i>&quot;tied&quot;</i><i></i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The value returned by &quot;tied&quot; on a tied variable is now the actual scalar that holds the object to which the variable is tied.  This lets ties be weakened with &quot;Scalar::Util::weaken(tied $tied_variable)&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode Support</h2>  <i>Supports (</i><i>almost</i><i>) Unicode 6.1</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Besides the addition of whole new scripts, and new characters in existing scripts, this new version of Unicode, as always, makes some changes to existing characters.  One change that may trip up some applications is that the General Category of two characters in the Latin-1 range, PILCROW SIGN and SECTION SIGN, has been changed from Other_Symbol to Other_Punctuation.  The same change has been made for a character in each of Tibetan, Ethiopic, and Aegean. The code points U+3248..U+324F (CIRCLED NUMBER TEN ON BLACK SQUARE through CIRCLED NUMBER EIGHTY ON BLACK SQUARE) have had their General Category changed from Other_Symbol to Other_Numeric.  The Line Break property has changes for Hebrew and Japanese; and because of other changes in 6.1, the Perl regular expression construct &quot;\X&quot; now works differently for some characters in Thai and Lao.<div class="spacer">
</div>
New aliases (synonyms) have been defined for many property values; these, along with the previously existing ones, are all cross-indexed in perluniprops.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The return value of &quot;charnames::viacode()&quot; is affected by other changes:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 Code point      Old Name             New Name<br/>
   U+000A    LINE FEED (LF)        LINE FEED<br/>
   U+000C    FORM FEED (FF)        FORM FEED<br/>
   U+000D    CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)  CARRIAGE RETURN<br/>
   U+0085    NEXT LINE (NEL)       NEXT LINE<br/>
   U+008E    SINGLE-SHIFT 2        SINGLE-SHIFT-2<br/>
   U+008F    SINGLE-SHIFT 3        SINGLE-SHIFT-3<br/>
   U+0091    PRIVATE USE 1         PRIVATE USE-1<br/>
   U+0092    PRIVATE USE 2         PRIVATE USE-2<br/>
   U+2118    SCRIPT CAPITAL P      WEIERSTRASS ELLIPTIC FUNCTION<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl will accept any of these names as input, but &quot;charnames::viacode()&quot; now returns the new name of each pair.  The change for U+2118 is considered by Unicode to be a correction, that is the original name was a mistake (but again, it will remain forever valid to use it to refer to U+2118).  But most of these changes are the fallout of the mistake Unicode 6.0 made in naming a character used in Japanese cell phones to be &quot;BELL&quot;, which conflicts with the longstanding industry use of (and Unicode's recommendation to use) that name to mean the ASCII control character at U+0007.  Therefore, that name has been deprecated in Perl since v5.14, and any use of it will raise a warning message (unless turned off).  The name &quot;ALERT&quot; is now the preferred name for this code point, with &quot;BEL&quot; an acceptable short form.  The name for the new cell phone character, at code point U+1F514, remains undefined in this version of Perl (hence we don't implement quite all of Unicode 6.1), but starting in v5.18, BELL will mean this character, and not U+0007.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unicode has taken steps to make sure that this sort of mistake does not happen again.  The Standard now includes all generally accepted names and abbreviations for control characters, whereas previously it didn't (though there were recommended names for most of them, which Perl used).  This means that most of those recommended names are now officially in the Standard.  Unicode did not recommend names for the four code points listed above between U+008E and U+008F, and in standardizing them Unicode subtly changed the names that Perl had previously given them, by replacing the final blank in each name by a hyphen.  Unicode also officially accepts names that Perl had deprecated, such as FILE SEPARATOR.  Now the only deprecated name is BELL. Finally, Perl now uses the new official names instead of the old (now considered obsolete) names for the first four code points in the list above (the ones which have the parentheses in them).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now that the names have been placed in the Unicode standard, these kinds of changes should not happen again, though corrections, such as to U+2118, are still possible.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unicode also added some name abbreviations, which Perl now accepts: SP for SPACE; TAB for CHARACTER TABULATION; NEW LINE, END OF LINE, NL, and EOL for LINE FEED; LOCKING-SHIFT ONE for SHIFT OUT; LOCKING-SHIFT ZERO for SHIFT IN; and ZWNBSP for ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE.<div class="spacer">
</div>
More details on this version of Unicode are provided in &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/&gt;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><i>&quot;use charnames&quot;</i><i> is no longer needed for </i><i>&quot;\N{</i><i>name</i><i>}&quot;</i><i></i><div class="spacer">
</div>
When &quot;\N{<i>name</i>}&quot; is encountered, the &quot;charnames&quot; module is now automatically loaded when needed as if the &quot;:full&quot; and &quot;:short&quot; options had been specified.  See charnames for more information.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><i>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</i><i> can now have Unicode loose name matching</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
This is described in the &quot;charnames&quot; item in &quot;Updated Modules and Pragmata&quot; below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Unicode Symbol Names</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl now has proper support for Unicode in symbol names.  It used to be that &quot;*{$foo}&quot; would ignore the internal UTF8 flag and use the bytes of the underlying representation to look up the symbol.  That meant that &quot;*{&quot;\x{100}&quot;}&quot; and &quot;*{&quot;\xc4\x80&quot;}&quot; would return the same thing.  All these parts of Perl have been fixed to account for Unicode:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Method names (including those passed to &quot;use overload&quot;)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>

<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Various warnings and error messages that mention variable names or values, methods, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In addition, a parsing bug has been fixed that prevented &quot;*{&#233;}&quot; from implicitly quoting the name, but instead interpreted it as &quot;*{+&#233;}&quot;, which would cause a strict violation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;*{&quot;*a::b&quot;}&quot; automatically strips off the * if it is followed by an ASCII letter.  That has been extended to all Unicode identifier characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
One-character non-ASCII non-punctuation variables (like $&#233;) are now subject to &quot;Used only once&quot; warnings.  They used to be exempt, as they were treated as punctuation variables.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Also, single-character Unicode punctuation variables (like $&#8240;) are now supported [perl #69032].<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Improved ability to mix locales and Unicode, including UTF-8 locales</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
An optional parameter has been added to &quot;use locale&quot;<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 use locale ':not_characters';<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
which tells Perl to use all but the &quot;LC_CTYPE&quot; and &quot;LC_COLLATE&quot; portions of the current locale.  Instead, the character set is assumed to be Unicode.  This lets locales and Unicode be seamlessly mixed, including the increasingly frequent UTF-8 locales.  When using this hybrid form of locales, the &quot;:locale&quot; layer to the open pragma can be used to interface with the file system, and there are CPAN modules available for ARGV and environment variable conversions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Full details are in perllocale.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>New function </i><i>&quot;fc&quot;</i><i> and corresponding escape sequence </i><i>&quot;\F&quot;</i><i> for Unicode foldcase</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Unicode foldcase is an extension to lowercase that gives better results when comparing two strings case-insensitively.  It has long been used internally in regular expression &quot;/i&quot; matching.  Now it is available explicitly through the new &quot;fc&quot; function call (enabled by &quot;use&#160;feature&#160;'fc'&quot;, or &quot;use v5.16&quot;, or explicitly callable via &quot;CORE::fc&quot;) or through the new &quot;\F&quot; sequence in double-quotish strings.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Full details are in &quot;fc&quot; in perlfunc.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>The Unicode </i><i>&quot;Script_Extensions&quot;</i><i> property is now supported.</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
New in Unicode 6.0, this is an improved &quot;Script&quot; property.  Details are in &quot;Scripts&quot; in perlunicode.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>XS Changes</h2>  <i>Improved typemaps for Some Builtin Types</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Most XS authors will know there is a longstanding bug in the OUTPUT typemap for T_AVREF (&quot;AV*&quot;), T_HVREF (&quot;HV*&quot;), T_CVREF (&quot;CV*&quot;), and T_SVREF (&quot;SVREF&quot; or &quot;\$foo&quot;) that requires manually decrementing the reference count of the return value instead of the typemap taking care of this.  For backwards-compatibility, this cannot be changed in the default typemaps.  But we now provide additional typemaps &quot;T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED&quot;, etc. that do not exhibit this bug.  Using them in your extension is as simple as having one line in your &quot;TYPEMAP&quot; section:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  HV*   T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><i>&quot;is_utf8_char()&quot;</i><i></i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The XS-callable function &quot;is_utf8_char()&quot;, when presented with malformed UTF-8 input, can read up to 12 bytes beyond the end of the string.  This cannot be fixed without changing its API, and so its use is now deprecated.  Use &quot;is_utf8_char_buf()&quot; (described just below) instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Added </i><i>&quot;is_utf8_char_buf()&quot;</i><i></i><div class="spacer">
</div>
This function is designed to replace the deprecated &quot;<i>is_utf8_char()</i>&quot; function.  It includes an extra parameter to make sure it doesn't read past the end of the input buffer.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Other </i><i>&quot;is_utf8_foo()&quot;</i><i> functions, as well as </i><i>&quot;utf8_to_foo()&quot;</i><i>, etc.</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Most other XS-callable functions that take UTF-8 encoded input implicitly assume that the UTF-8 is valid (not malformed) with respect to buffer length.  Do not do things such as change a character's case or see if it is alphanumeric without first being sure that it is valid UTF-8.  This can be safely done for a whole string by using one of the functions &quot;is_utf8_string()&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_string_loc()&quot;, and &quot;is_utf8_string_loclen()&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>New Pad API</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Many new functions have been added to the API for manipulating lexical pads.  See &quot;Pad Data Structures&quot; in perlapi for more information.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Changes to Special Variables</h2>  <i></i><i>$$</i><i> can be assigned to</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
$$ was made read-only in Perl 5.8.0.  But only sometimes: &quot;local $$&quot; would make it writable again.  Some CPAN modules were using &quot;local $$&quot; or XS code to bypass the read-only check, so there is no reason to keep $$ read-only.  (This change also allowed a bug to be fixed while maintaining backward compatibility.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><i>$^X</i><i> converted to an absolute path on FreeBSD, OS X and Solaris</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
$^X is now converted to an absolute path on OS X, FreeBSD (without needing  <i>/proc</i> mounted) and Solaris 10 and 11.  This augments the previous approach of using  <i>/proc</i> on Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD (in all cases, where mounted).<div class="spacer">
</div>
This makes relocatable perl installations more useful on these platforms. (See &quot;Relocatable @INC&quot; in  <i>INSTALL</i>)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Debugger Changes</h2>  <i>Features inside the debugger</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The current Perl's feature bundle is now enabled for commands entered in the interactive debugger.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>New option for the debugger's </i><b><i>t</i></b><i> command</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>t</b> command in the debugger, which toggles tracing mode, now accepts a numeric argument that determines how many levels of subroutine calls to trace.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><i>&quot;enable&quot;</i><i> and </i><i>&quot;disable&quot;</i><i></i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The debugger now has &quot;disable&quot; and &quot;enable&quot; commands for disabling existing breakpoints and re-enabling them.  See perldebug.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Breakpoints with file names</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The debugger's &quot;b&quot; command for setting breakpoints now lets a line number be prefixed with a file name.  See &quot;b [file]:[line] [condition]&quot; in perldebug.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The &quot;CORE&quot; Namespace</h2>  <i>The </i><i>&quot;CORE::&quot;</i><i> prefix</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;CORE::&quot; prefix can now be used on keywords enabled by feature.pm, even outside the scope of &quot;use feature&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Subroutines in the </i><i>&quot;CORE&quot;</i><i> namespace</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Many Perl keywords are now available as subroutines in the CORE namespace. This lets them be aliased:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    BEGIN { *entangle = \&amp;CORE::tie }<br/>
    entangle $variable, $package, @args;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And for prototypes to be bypassed:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    sub mytie(\[%$*@]$@) {<br/>
        my ($ref, $pack, @args) = @_;<br/>
        ... do something ...<br/>
        goto &amp;CORE::tie;<br/>
    }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some of these cannot be called through references or via &amp;foo syntax, but must be called as barewords.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See CORE for details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Other Changes</h2>  <i>Anonymous handles</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Automatically generated file handles are now named __ANONIO__ when the variable name cannot be determined, rather than $__ANONIO__.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Autoloaded sort Subroutines</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Custom sort subroutines can now be autoloaded [perl #30661]:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    sub AUTOLOAD { ... }<br/>
    @sorted = sort foo @list; # uses AUTOLOAD<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><i>&quot;continue&quot;</i><i> no longer requires the &quot;switch&quot; feature</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;continue&quot; keyword has two meanings.  It can introduce a &quot;continue&quot; block after a loop, or it can exit the current &quot;when&quot; block.  Up to now, the latter meaning was valid only with the &quot;switch&quot; feature enabled, and was a syntax error otherwise.  Since the main purpose of feature.pm is to avoid conflicts with user-defined subroutines, there is no reason for &quot;continue&quot; to depend on it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>DTrace probes for interpreter phase change</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;phase-change&quot; probes will fire when the interpreter's phase changes, which tracks the &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot; variable.  &quot;arg0&quot; is the new phase name; &quot;arg1&quot; is the old one.  This is useful for limiting your instrumentation to one or more of: compile time, run time, or destruct time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><i>&quot;__FILE__()&quot;</i><i> Syntax</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;__FILE__&quot;, &quot;__LINE__&quot; and &quot;__PACKAGE__&quot; tokens can now be written with an empty pair of parentheses after them.  This makes them parse the same way as &quot;time&quot;, &quot;fork&quot; and other built-in functions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>The </i><i>&quot;\$&quot;</i><i> prototype accepts any scalar lvalue</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;\$&quot; and &quot;\[$]&quot; subroutine prototypes now accept any scalar lvalue argument.  Previously they accepted only scalars beginning with &quot;$&quot; and hash and array elements.  This change makes them consistent with the way the built-in &quot;read&quot; and &quot;recv&quot; functions (among others) parse their arguments.  This means that one can override the built-in functions with custom subroutines that parse their arguments the same way.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><i>&quot;_&quot;</i><i> in subroutine prototypes</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;_&quot; character in subroutine prototypes is now allowed before &quot;@&quot; or &quot;%&quot;.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Security</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Use &quot;is_utf8_char_buf()&quot; and not &quot;is_utf8_char()&quot;</h2> The latter function is now deprecated because its API is insufficient to guarantee that it doesn't read (up to 12 bytes in the worst case) beyond the end of its input string.  See  <i>is_utf8_char_buf()</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Malformed UTF-8 input could cause attempts to read beyond the end of the buffer</h2> Two new XS-accessible functions, &quot;utf8_to_uvchr_buf()&quot; and &quot;utf8_to_uvuni_buf()&quot; are now available to prevent this, and the Perl core has been converted to use them.

A Perl program that accepts a flags value from an external source could expose itself to denial of service or arbitrary code execution attacks.  There are no known exploits in the wild.  The problem has been corrected by explicitly disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function pointers to null.  Bug reported by Cl&#233;ment Lecigne. (5.14.2)</div>

<h1>Future Deprecations</h1> This section serves as a notice of features that are  <i>likely</i> to be removed or deprecated in the next release of perl (5.18.0).  If your code depends on these features, you should contact the Perl 5 Porters via the mailing list &lt;http://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html&gt; or perlbug to explain your use case and inform the deprecation process.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Core Modules</h2> These modules may be marked as deprecated  <i>from the core</i>.  This only means that they will no longer be installed by default with the core distribution, but will remain available on the CPAN.<dl>

Unescaped literal &quot;{&quot; in regular expressions.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Starting with v5.20, it is planned to require a literal &quot;{&quot; to be escaped, for example by preceding it with a backslash.  In v5.18, a deprecated warning message will be emitted for all such uses. This affects only patterns that are to match a literal &quot;{&quot;.  Other uses of this character, such as part of a quantifier or sequence as in those below, are completely unaffected:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>

    /\p{Alphabetic}/<br/>
    /\N{DIGIT ZERO}<br/>

<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Special blocks called in void context</h2> Special blocks (&quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;CHECK&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot;, &quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, &quot;END&quot;) are now called in void context.  This avoids wasteful copying of the result of the last statement [perl #108794].</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The &quot;overloading&quot; pragma and regexp objects</h2> With &quot;no overloading&quot;, regular expression objects returned by &quot;qr//&quot; are now stringified as &quot;Regexp=REGEXP(0xbe600d)&quot; instead of the regular expression itself [perl #108780].</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Two XS typemap Entries removed</h2> Two presumably unused XS typemap entries have been removed from the core typemap: T_DATAUNIT and T_CALLBACK.  If you are, against all odds, a user of these, please see the instructions on how to restore them in perlxstypemap.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode 6.1 has incompatibilities with Unicode 6.0</h2> These are detailed in &quot;Supports (almost) Unicode 6.1&quot; above. You can compile this version of Perl to use Unicode 6.0.  See &quot;Hacking Perl to work on earlier Unicode versions (for very serious hackers only)&quot; in perlunicode.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Borland compiler</h2> All support for the Borland compiler has been dropped.  The code had not worked for a long time anyway.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Certain deprecated Unicode properties are no longer supported by default</h2> Perl should never have exposed certain Unicode properties that are used by Unicode internally and not meant to be publicly available.  Use of these has generated deprecated warning messages since Perl 5.12.  The removed properties are Other_Alphabetic, Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, Other_Grapheme_Extend, Other_ID_Continue, Other_ID_Start, Other_Lowercase, Other_Math, and Other_Uppercase.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl may be recompiled to include any or all of them; instructions are given in &quot;Unicode character properties that are NOT accepted by Perl&quot; in perluniprops.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Dereferencing IO thingies as typeglobs</h2> The &quot;*{...}&quot; operator, when passed a reference to an IO thingy (as in &quot;*{*STDIN{IO}}&quot;), creates a new typeglob containing just that IO object. Previously, it would stringify as an empty string, but some operators would treat it as undefined, producing an &quot;uninitialized&quot; warning. Now it stringifies as __ANONIO__ [perl #96326].</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>User-defined case-changing operations</h2> This feature was deprecated in Perl 5.14, and has now been removed. The CPAN module Unicode::Casing provides better functionality without the drawbacks that this feature had, as are detailed in the 5.14 documentation: &lt;http://perldoc.perl.org/5.14.0/perlunicode.html#User-Defined-Case-Mappings-%28for-serious-hackers-only%29&gt;</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>XSUBs are now 'static'</h2> XSUB C functions are now 'static', that is, they are not visible from outside the compilation unit.  Users can use the new &quot;XS_EXTERNAL(name)&quot; and &quot;XS_INTERNAL(name)&quot; macros to pick the desired linking behavior. The ordinary &quot;XS(name)&quot; declaration for XSUBs will continue to declare non-'static' XSUBs for compatibility, but the XS compiler, ExtUtils::ParseXS (&quot;xsubpp&quot;) will emit 'static' XSUBs by default. ExtUtils::ParseXS's behavior can be reconfigured from XS using the &quot;EXPORT_XSUB_SYMBOLS&quot; keyword.  See perlxs for details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Weakening read-only references</h2> Weakening read-only references is no longer permitted.  It should never have worked anyway, and could sometimes result in crashes.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Tying scalars that hold typeglobs</h2> Attempting to tie a scalar after a typeglob was assigned to it would instead tie the handle in the typeglob's IO slot.  This meant that it was impossible to tie the scalar itself.  Similar problems affected &quot;tied&quot; and &quot;untie&quot;: &quot;tied $scalar&quot; would return false on a tied scalar if the last thing returned was a typeglob, and &quot;untie $scalar&quot; on such a tied scalar would do nothing.<div class="spacer">
</div>
We fixed this problem before Perl 5.14.0, but it caused problems with some CPAN modules, so we put in a deprecation cycle instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now the deprecation has been removed and this bug has been fixed.  So &quot;tie $scalar&quot; will always tie the scalar, not the handle it holds.  To tie the handle, use &quot;tie *$scalar&quot; (with an explicit asterisk).  The same applies to &quot;tied *$scalar&quot; and &quot;untie *$scalar&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>IPC::Open3 no longer provides &quot;xfork()&quot;, &quot;xclose_on_exec()&quot; and &quot;xpipe_anon()&quot;</h2> All three functions were private, undocumented, and unexported.  They do not appear to be used by any code on CPAN.  Two have been inlined and one deleted entirely.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>$$ no longer caches PID</h2> Previously, if one called  <i>fork</i>(3) from C, Perl's notion of $$ could go out of sync with what  <i>getpid()</i> returns.  By always fetching the value of $$ via  <i>getpid()</i>, this potential bug is eliminated. Code that depends on the caching behavior will break.  As described in Core Enhancements, $$ is now writable, but it will be reset during a fork.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>$$ and &quot;getppid()&quot; no longer emulate POSIX semantics under LinuxThreads</h2> The POSIX emulation of $$ and &quot;getppid()&quot; under the obsolete LinuxThreads implementation has been removed. This only impacts users of Linux 2.4 and users of Debian GNU/kFreeBSD up to and including 6.0, not the vast majority of Linux installations that use NPTL threads.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This means that &quot;getppid()&quot;, like $$, is now always guaranteed to return the OS's idea of the current state of the process, not perl's cached version of it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the documentation for $$ for details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>$&lt;, $&gt;, $( and $) are no longer cached</h2> Similarly to the changes to $$ and &quot;getppid()&quot;, the internal caching of $&lt;, $&gt;, $( and $) has been removed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When we cached these values our idea of what they were would drift out of sync with reality if someone (e.g., someone embedding perl) called &quot;sete?[ug]id()&quot; without updating &quot;PL_e?[ug]id&quot;.  Having to deal with this complexity wasn't worth it given how cheap the &quot;gete?[ug]id()&quot; system call is.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This change will break a handful of CPAN modules that use the XS-level &quot;PL_uid&quot;, &quot;PL_gid&quot;, &quot;PL_euid&quot; or &quot;PL_egid&quot; variables.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The fix for those breakages is to use &quot;PerlProc_gete?[ug]id()&quot; to retrieve them (e.g., &quot;PerlProc_getuid()&quot;), and not to assign to &quot;PL_e?[ug]id&quot; if you change the UID/GID/EUID/EGID.  There is no longer any need to do so since perl will always retrieve the up-to-date version of those values from the OS.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Which Non-ASCII characters get quoted by &quot;quotemeta&quot; and &quot;\Q&quot; has changed</h2> This is unlikely to result in a real problem, as Perl does not attach special meaning to any non-ASCII character, so it is currently irrelevant which are quoted or not.  This change fixes bug [perl #77654] and brings Perl's behavior more into line with Unicode's recommendations. See &quot;quotemeta&quot; in perlfunc.</div>

<h1>Performance Enhancements</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Improved performance for Unicode properties in regular expressions<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Matching a code point against a Unicode property is now done via a binary search instead of linear.  This means for example that the worst case for a 1000 item property is 10 probes instead of 1000.  This inefficiency has been compensated for in the past by permanently storing in a hash the results of a given probe plus the results for the adjacent 64 code points, under the theory that near-by code points are likely to be searched for.  A separate hash was used for each mention of a Unicode property in each regular expression.  Thus, &quot;qr/\p{foo}abc\p{foo}/&quot; would generate two hashes.  Any probes in one instance would be unknown to the other, and the hashes could expand separately to be quite large if the regular expression were used on many different widely-separated code points. Now, however, there is just one hash shared by all instances of a given property.  This means that if &quot;\p{foo}&quot; is matched against &quot;A&quot; in one regular expression in a thread, the result will be known immediately to all regular expressions, and the relentless march of using up memory is slowed considerably.</dd>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Version declarations with the &quot;use&quot; keyword (e.g., &quot;use 5.012&quot;) are now faster, as they enable features without loading  <i>feature.pm</i>.</dd>

&quot;local $_&quot; is faster now, as it no longer iterates through magic that it is not going to copy anyway.</dd>

<dd>
Perl 5.12.0 sped up the destruction of objects whose classes define empty &quot;DESTROY&quot; methods (to prevent autoloading), by simply not calling such empty methods.  This release takes this optimization a step further, by not calling any &quot;DESTROY&quot; method that begins with a &quot;return&quot; statement.  This can be useful for destructors that are only used for debugging:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use constant DEBUG =&gt; 1;<br/>
    sub DESTROY { return unless DEBUG; ... }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Constant-folding will reduce the first statement to &quot;return;&quot; if DEBUG is set to 0, triggering this optimization.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Assigning to a variable that holds a typeglob or copy-on-write scalar is now much faster.  Previously the typeglob would be stringified or the copy-on-write scalar would be copied before being clobbered.</dd>

<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Assignment to &quot;substr&quot; in void context is now more than twice its previous speed.  Instead of creating and returning a special lvalue scalar that is then assigned to, &quot;substr&quot; modifies the original string itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;substr&quot; no longer calculates a value to return when called in void context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Due to changes in File::Glob, Perl's &quot;glob&quot; function and its &quot;&lt;...&gt;&quot; equivalent are now much faster.  The splitting of the pattern into words has been rewritten in C, resulting in speed-ups of 20% for some cases.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This does not affect &quot;glob&quot; on VMS, as it does not use File::Glob.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The short-circuiting operators &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;, &quot;||&quot;, and &quot;//&quot;, when chained (such as &quot;$a || $b || $c&quot;), are now considerably faster to short-circuit, due to reduced optree traversal.</dd>

CGI has been upgraded from version 3.52 to 3.59.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It uses the public and documented FCGI.pm API in CGI::Fast.  CGI::Fast was using an FCGI API that was deprecated and removed from documentation more than ten years ago.  Usage of this deprecated API with FCGI &gt;= 0.70 or FCGI &lt;= 0.73 introduces a security issue. &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=68380&gt; &lt;http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-2766&gt;<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Things that may break your code:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;url()&quot; was fixed to return &quot;PATH_INFO&quot; when it is explicitly requested with either the &quot;path=&gt;1&quot; or &quot;path_info=&gt;1&quot; flag.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If your code is running under mod_rewrite (or compatible) and you are calling &quot;self_url()&quot; or you are calling &quot;url()&quot; and passing &quot;path_info=&gt;1&quot;, these methods will actually be returning &quot;PATH_INFO&quot; now, as you have explicitly requested or &quot;self_url()&quot; has requested on your behalf.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The &quot;PATH_INFO&quot; has been omitted in such URLs since the issue was introduced in the 3.12 release in December, 2005.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This bug is so old your application may have come to depend on it or workaround it. Check for application before upgrading to this release.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Examples of affected method calls:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  $q-&gt;url(-absolute =&gt; 1, -query =&gt; 1, -path_info =&gt; 1);<br/>
  $q-&gt;url(-path=&gt;1);<br/>
  $q-&gt;url(-full=&gt;1,-path=&gt;1);<br/>
  $q-&gt;url(-rewrite=&gt;1,-path=&gt;1);<br/>
  $q-&gt;self_url();<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
We no longer read from STDIN when the Content-Length is not set, preventing requests with no Content-Length from sometimes freezing. This is consistent with the CGI RFC 3875, and is also consistent with CGI::Simple.  However, the old behavior may have been expected by some command-line uses of CGI.pm.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

File::Glob has been upgraded from version 1.12 to 1.17.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On Windows, tilde (~) expansion now checks the &quot;USERPROFILE&quot; environment variable, after checking &quot;HOME&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It has a new &quot;:bsd_glob&quot; export tag, intended to replace &quot;:glob&quot;.  Like &quot;:glob&quot; it overrides &quot;glob&quot; with a function that does not split the glob pattern into words, but, unlike &quot;:glob&quot;, it iterates properly in scalar context, instead of returning the last file.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There are other changes affecting Perl's own &quot;glob&quot; operator (which uses File::Glob internally, except on VMS).  See &quot;Performance Enhancements&quot; and &quot;Selected Bug Fixes&quot;.</dd>

IO has been upgraded from version 1.25_04 to 1.25_06, and IO::Handle from version 1.31 to 1.33.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Together, these upgrades fix a problem with IO::Handle's &quot;getline&quot; and &quot;getlines&quot; methods.  When these methods are called on the special ARGV handle, the next file is automatically opened, as happens with the built-in &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; and &quot;readline&quot; functions.  But, unlike the built-ins, these methods were not respecting the caller's use of the open pragma and applying the appropriate I/O layers to the newly-opened file [rt.cpan.org #66474].</dd>

Added language codes from ISO 639-5<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Added language/script codes from the IANA language subtag registry<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Fixed an uninitialized value warning [rt.cpan.org #67438].<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Fixed the return value for the all_XXX_codes and all_XXX_names functions [rt.cpan.org #69100].<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Reorganized modules to move Locale::MODULE to Locale::Codes::MODULE to allow for cleaner future additions.  The original four modules (Locale::Language, Locale::Currency, Locale::Country, Locale::Script) will continue to work, but all new sets of codes will be added in the Locale::Codes namespace.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The code2XXX, XXX2code, all_XXX_codes, and all_XXX_names functions now support retired codes.  All codesets may be specified by a constant or by their name now.  Previously, they were specified only by a constant.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The alias_code function exists for backward compatibility.  It has been replaced by rename_country_code.  The alias_code function will be removed some time after September, 2013.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
All work is now done in the central module (Locale::Codes).  Previously, some was still done in the wrapper modules (Locale::Codes::*).  Added Language Family codes (langfam) as defined in ISO 639-5.</dd>

&#160;</div>
&quot;int()&quot; on a Math::BigRat object containing -1/2 now creates a Math::BigInt containing 0, rather than -0.  Math::BigInt does not even support negative zero, so the resulting object was actually malformed [perl #95530].</dd>

It no longer turns off layers on standard handles when invoked without the &quot;:std&quot; directive.  Similarly, when invoked  <i>with</i> the &quot;:std&quot; directive, it now clears layers on STDERR before applying the new ones, and not just on STDIN and STDOUT [perl #92728].</dd>

overload has been upgraded from version 1.13 to 1.18.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;overload::Overloaded&quot; no longer calls &quot;can&quot; on the class, but uses another means to determine whether the object has overloading.  It was never correct for it to call &quot;can&quot;, as overloading does not respect AUTOLOAD.  So classes that autoload methods and implement &quot;can&quot; no longer have to account for overloading [perl #40333].<div style="height: 1.00em;">

A warning is now produced for invalid arguments.  See &quot;New Diagnostics&quot;.</dd>

PerlIO::scalar has been upgraded from version 0.11 to 0.14.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(This is the module that implements &quot;open $fh, '&gt;', \$scalar&quot;.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It fixes a problem with &quot;open my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, \$scalar&quot; not working if $scalar is a copy-on-write scalar. (5.14.2)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It also fixes a hang that occurs with &quot;readline&quot; or &quot;&lt;$fh&gt;&quot; if a typeglob has been assigned to $scalar [perl #92258].<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It no longer assumes during &quot;seek&quot; that $scalar is a string internally. If it didn't crash, it was close to doing so [perl #92706].  Also, the internal print routine no longer assumes that the position set by &quot;seek&quot; is valid, but extends the string to that position, filling the intervening bytes (between the old length and the seek position) with nulls [perl #78980].<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Printing to an in-memory handle now works if the $scalar holds a reference, stringifying the reference before modifying it.  References used to be treated as empty strings.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Printing to an in-memory handle no longer crashes if the $scalar happens to hold a number internally, but no string buffer.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Printing to an in-memory handle no longer creates scalars that confuse the regular expression engine [perl #108398].</dd>

POSIX has been upgraded from version 1.24 to 1.30.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
POSIX no longer uses AutoLoader.  Any code which was relying on this implementation detail was buggy, and may fail because of this change. The module's Perl code has been considerably simplified, roughly halving the number of lines, with no change in functionality.  The XS code has been refactored to reduce the size of the shared object by about 12%, with no change in functionality.  More POSIX functions now have tests.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;sigsuspend&quot; and &quot;pause&quot; now run signal handlers before returning, as the whole point of these two functions is to wait until a signal has arrived, and then return  <i>after</i> it has been triggered.  Delayed, or &quot;safe&quot;, signals were preventing that from happening, possibly resulting in race conditions [perl #107216].<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;POSIX::sleep&quot; is now a direct call into the underlying OS &quot;sleep&quot; function, instead of being a Perl wrapper on &quot;CORE::sleep&quot;. &quot;POSIX::dup2&quot; now returns the correct value on Win32 ( <i>i.e.</i>, the file descriptor).  &quot;POSIX::SigSet&quot; &quot;sigsuspend&quot; and &quot;sigpending&quot; and &quot;POSIX::pause&quot; now dispatch safe signals immediately before returning to their caller.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;POSIX::Termios::setattr&quot; now defaults the third argument to &quot;TCSANOW&quot;, instead of 0. On most platforms &quot;TCSANOW&quot; is defined to be 0, but on some 0 is not a valid parameter, which caused a call with defaults to fail.</dd>

<h1>Diagnostics</h1> The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see perldiag.<div class="subsection">
<h2>New Diagnostics</h2>  <i>New Errors</i><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Cannot set tied @DB::args<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This error occurs when &quot;caller&quot; tries to set @DB::args but finds it tied.  Before this error was added, it used to crash instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Cannot tie unreifiable array<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This error is part of a safety check that the &quot;tie&quot; operator does before tying a special array like @_.  You should never see this message.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&amp;CORE::%s cannot be called directly<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This occurs when a subroutine in the &quot;CORE::&quot; namespace is called with &amp;foo syntax or through a reference.  Some subroutines in this package cannot yet be called that way, but must be called as barewords.  See &quot;Subroutines in the &quot;CORE&quot; namespace&quot;, above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Source filters apply only to byte streams<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This new error occurs when you try to activate a source filter (usually by loading a source filter module) within a string passed to &quot;eval&quot; under the &quot;unicode_eval&quot; feature.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>New Warnings</i><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
defined(@array) is deprecated<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The long-deprecated &quot;defined(@array)&quot; now also warns for package variables. Previously it issued a warning for lexical variables only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>length()</i> used on %s<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This new warning occurs when &quot;length&quot; is used on an array or hash, instead of &quot;scalar(@array)&quot; or &quot;scalar(keys %hash)&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
lvalue attribute %s already-defined subroutine<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
attributes.pm now emits this warning when the :lvalue attribute is applied to a Perl subroutine that has already been defined, as doing so can have unexpected side-effects.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
overload arg '%s' is invalid<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This warning, in the &quot;overload&quot; category, is produced when the overload pragma is given an argument it doesn't recognize, presumably a mistyped operator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
$[ used in %s (did you mean $] ?)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This new warning exists to catch the mistaken use of $[ in version checks.  $], not $[, contains the version number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Useless assignment to a temporary<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Assigning to a temporary scalar returned from an lvalue subroutine now produces this warning [perl #31946].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Useless use of \E<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h2>Removed Errors</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;sort is now a reserved word&quot;<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This error used to occur when &quot;sort&quot; was called without arguments, followed by &quot;;&quot; or &quot;)&quot;.  (E.g., &quot;sort;&quot; would die, but &quot;{sort}&quot; was OK.)  This error message was added in Perl 3 to catch code like &quot;close(sort)&quot; which would no longer work.  More than two decades later, this message is no longer appropriate.  Now &quot;sort&quot; without arguments is always allowed, and returns an empty list, as it did in those cases where it was already allowed [perl #90030].</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Changes to Existing Diagnostics</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;Applying pattern match...&quot; or similar warning produced when an array or hash is on the left-hand side of the &quot;=~&quot; operator now mentions the name of the variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;Attempt to free non-existent shared string&quot; has had the spelling of &quot;non-existent&quot; corrected to &quot;nonexistent&quot;.  It was already listed with the correct spelling in perldiag.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The error messages for using &quot;default&quot; and &quot;when&quot; outside a topicalizer have been standardized to match the messages for &quot;continue&quot; and loop controls.  They now read 'Can't &quot;default&quot; outside a topicalizer' and 'Can't &quot;when&quot; outside a topicalizer'.  They both used to be 'Can't use  <i>when()</i> outside a topicalizer' [perl #91514].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message, &quot;Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, no properties match it; all inverse properties do&quot; has been changed to &quot;Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, all \p{} matches fail; all \P{} matches succeed&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Redefinition warnings for constant subroutines used to be mandatory, even occurring under &quot;no warnings&quot;.  Now they respect the warnings pragma.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;glob failed&quot; warning message is now suppressible via &quot;no warnings&quot; [perl #111656].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The Invalid version format error message now says &quot;negative version number&quot; within the parentheses, rather than &quot;non-numeric data&quot;, for negative numbers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The two warnings Possible attempt to put comments in  <i>qw()</i> list and Possible attempt to separate words with commas are no longer mutually exclusive: the same &quot;qw&quot; construct may produce both.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The uninitialized warning for &quot;y///r&quot; when $_ is implicit and undefined now mentions the variable name, just like the non-/r variation of the operator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The 'Use of &quot;foo&quot; without parentheses is ambiguous' warning has been extended to apply also to user-defined subroutines with a (;$) prototype, and not just to built-in functions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Warnings that mention the names of lexical (&quot;my&quot;) variables with Unicode characters in them now respect the presence or absence of the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer on the output handle, instead of outputting UTF8 regardless.  Also, the correct names are included in the strings passed to $SIG{__WARN__} handlers, rather than the raw UTF8 bytes.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
The code and tests for IPC::Open2 have been moved from <i>ext/IPC-Open2</i> into  <i>ext/IPC-Open3</i>, as &quot;IPC::Open2::open2()&quot; is implemented as a thin wrapper around &quot;IPC::Open3::_open3()&quot;, and hence is very tightly coupled to it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The magic types and magic vtables are now generated from data in a new script  <i>regen/mg_vtable.pl</i>, instead of being maintained by hand.  As different EBCDIC variants can't agree on the code point for '~', the character to code point conversion is done at build time by  <i>generate_uudmap</i> to a new generated header  <i>mg_data.h</i>.  &quot;PL_vtbl_bm&quot; and &quot;PL_vtbl_fm&quot; are now defined by the pre-processor as &quot;PL_vtbl_regexp&quot;, instead of being distinct C variables. &quot;PL_vtbl_sig&quot; has been removed.</dd>

The file <i>global.sym</i> is no longer needed, and has been removed.  It contained a list of all exported functions, one of the files generated by  <i>regen/embed.pl</i> from data in <i>embed.fnc</i> and <i>regen/opcodes</i>.  The code has been refactored so that the only user of  <i>global.sym</i>, <i>makedef.pl</i>, now reads  <i>embed.fnc</i> and <i>regen/opcodes</i> directly, removing the need to store the list of exported functions in an intermediate file.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As <i>global.sym</i> was never installed, this change should not be visible outside the build process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>pod/buildtoc</i>, used by the build process to build perltoc, has been refactored and simplified.  It now contains only code to build perltoc; the code to regenerate Makefiles has been moved to  <i>Porting/pod_rules.pl</i>. It's a bug if this change has any material effect on the build process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

<dd>
<i>pod/roffitall</i> is now built by <i>pod/buildtoc</i>, instead of being shipped with the distribution.  Its list of manpages is now generated (and therefore current).  See also RT #103202 for an unresolved related issue.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
The compiled representation of formats is now stored via the &quot;mg_ptr&quot; of their &quot;PERL_MAGIC_fm&quot;.  Previously it was stored in the string buffer, beyond &quot;SvLEN()&quot;, the regular end of the string.  &quot;SvCOMPILED()&quot; and &quot;SvCOMPILED_{on,off}()&quot; now exist solely for compatibility for XS code. The first is always 0, the other two now no-ops. (5.14.1)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Some global variables have been marked &quot;const&quot;, members in the interpreter structure have been re-ordered, and the opcodes have been re-ordered.  The op &quot;OP_AELEMFAST&quot; has been split into &quot;OP_AELEMFAST&quot; and &quot;OP_AELEMFAST_LEX&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When empting a hash of its elements (e.g., via undef(%h), or %h=()), HvARRAY field is no longer temporarily zeroed.  Any destructors called on the freed elements see the remaining elements.  Thus, %h=() becomes more like &quot;delete $h{$_} for keys %h&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Boyer-Moore compiled scalars are now PVMGs, and the Boyer-Moore tables are now stored via the mg_ptr of their &quot;PERL_MAGIC_bm&quot;. Previously they were PVGVs, with the tables stored in the string buffer, beyond &quot;SvLEN()&quot;.  This eliminates the last place where the core stores data beyond &quot;SvLEN()&quot;.</dd>

Simplified logic in &quot;Perl_sv_magic()&quot; introduces a small change of behavior for error cases involving unknown magic types.  Previously, if &quot;Perl_sv_magic()&quot; was passed a magic type unknown to it, it would</dd>

<i>embedvar.h</i> has been simplified, and one level of macro indirection for PL_* variables has been removed for the default (non-multiplicity) configuration.  PERLVAR*() macros now directly expand their arguments to tokens such as &quot;PL_defgv&quot;, instead of expanding to &quot;PL_Idefgv&quot;, with  <i>embedvar.h</i> defining a macro to map &quot;PL_Idefgv&quot; to &quot;PL_defgv&quot;.  XS code which has unwarranted chumminess with the implementation may need updating.</dd>

<dd>
The returned code point from the function &quot;utf8n_to_uvuni()&quot; when the input is malformed UTF-8, malformations are allowed, and &quot;utf8&quot; warnings are off is now the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER whenever the malformation is such that no well-defined code point can be computed.  Previously the returned value was essentially garbage.  The only malformations that have well-defined values are a zero-length string (0 is the return), and overlong UTF-8 sequences.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>

Padlists are now marked &quot;AvREAL&quot;; i.e., reference-counted.  They have always been reference-counted, but were not marked real, because  <i>pad.c</i> did its own clean-up, instead of using the usual clean-up code in  <i>sv.c</i>. That caused problems in thread cloning, so now the &quot;AvREAL&quot; flag is on, but is turned off in  <i>pad.c</i> right before the padlist is freed (after  <i>pad.c</i> has done its custom freeing of the pads).</dd>

Perl now checks whether the array (the linearized isa) returned by a MRO plugin begins with the name of the class itself, for which the array was created, instead of assuming that it does.  This prevents the first element from being skipped during method lookup.  It also means that &quot;mro::get_linear_isa&quot; may return an array with one more element than the MRO plugin provided [perl #94306].</dd>

There are now feature bundle hints in &quot;PL_hints&quot; ($^H) that version declarations use, to avoid having to load  <i>feature.pm</i>.  One setting of the hint bits indicates a &quot;custom&quot; feature bundle, which means that the entries in &quot;%^H&quot; still apply.   <i>feature.pm</i> uses that.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The &quot;HINT_FEATURE_MASK&quot; macro is defined in <i>perl.h</i> along with other hints.  Other macros for setting and testing features and bundles are in the new  <i>feature.h</i>.  &quot;FEATURE_IS_ENABLED&quot; (which has moved to  <i>feature.h</i>) is no longer used throughout the codebase, but more specific macros, e.g., &quot;FEATURE_SAY_IS_ENABLED&quot;, that are defined in  <i>feature.h</i>.</dd>

Two new functions &quot;utf8_to_uvchr_buf()&quot; and &quot;utf8_to_uvuni_buf()&quot; have been added.

<h1>Selected Bug Fixes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Array and hash</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A bug has been fixed that would cause a &quot;Use of freed value in iteration&quot; error if the next two hash elements that would be iterated over are deleted [perl #85026]. (5.14.1)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Deleting the current hash iterator (the hash element that would be returned by the next call to &quot;each&quot;) in void context used not to free it [perl #85026].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>

Deletion of methods via &quot;delete $Class::{method}&quot; syntax used to update method caches if called in void context, but not scalar or list context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When hash elements are deleted in void context, the internal hash entry is now freed before the value is freed, to prevent destructors called by that latter freeing from seeing the hash in an inconsistent state.  It was possible to cause double-frees if the destructor freed the hash itself [perl #100340].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A &quot;keys&quot; optimization in Perl 5.12.0 to make it faster on empty hashes caused &quot;each&quot; not to reset the iterator if called after the last element was deleted.</dd>

It is possible from XS code to create hashes with elements that have no values.  The hash element and slice operators used to crash when handling these in lvalue context.  They now produce a &quot;Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted&quot; error message.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
If list assignment to a hash or array triggered destructors that freed the hash or array itself, a crash would ensue.  This is no longer the case [perl #107440].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
It used to be possible to free the typeglob of a localized array or hash (e.g., &quot;local @{&quot;x&quot;}; delete $::{x}&quot;), resulting in a crash on scope exit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Some core bugs affecting Hash::Util have been fixed: locking a hash element that is a glob copy no longer causes the next assignment to it to corrupt the glob (5.14.2), and unlocking a hash element that holds a copy-on-write scalar no longer causes modifications to that scalar to modify other scalars that were sharing the same string buffer.</dd>

When presented with malformed UTF-8 input, the XS-callable functions &quot;is_utf8_string()&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_string_loc()&quot;, and &quot;is_utf8_string_loclen()&quot; could read beyond the end of the input string by up to 12 bytes.  This no longer happens.  [perl #32080]. However, currently, &quot;is_utf8_char()&quot; still has this defect, see &quot; <i>is_utf8_char()</i>&quot; above.</dd>

<h2>Compile-time hints</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>

Tying &quot;%^H&quot; no longer causes perl to crash or ignore the contents of &quot;%^H&quot; when entering a compilation scope [perl #106282].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;eval $string&quot; and &quot;require&quot; used not to localize &quot;%^H&quot; during compilation if it was empty at the time the &quot;eval&quot; call itself was compiled.  This could lead to scary side effects, like &quot;use re &quot;/m&quot;&quot; enabling other flags that the surrounding code was trying to enable for its caller [perl #68750].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;eval $string&quot; and &quot;require&quot; no longer localize hints ($^H and &quot;%^H&quot;) at run time, but only during compilation of the $string or required file. This makes &quot;BEGIN { $^H{foo}=7 }&quot; equivalent to &quot;BEGIN { eval '$^H{foo}=7' }&quot; [perl #70151].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Creating a BEGIN block from XS code (via &quot;newXS&quot; or &quot;newATTRSUB&quot;) would, on completion, make the hints of the current compiling code the current hints.  This could cause warnings to occur in a non-warning scope.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Copy-on-write scalars</h2> Copy-on-write or shared hash key scalars were introduced in 5.8.0, but most Perl code did not encounter them (they were used mostly internally).  Perl 5.10.0 extended them, such that assigning &quot;__PACKAGE__&quot; or a hash key to a scalar would make it copy-on-write.  Several parts of Perl were not updated to account for them, but have now been fixed.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;utf8::decode&quot; had a nasty bug that would modify copy-on-write scalars' string buffers in place (i.e., skipping the copy).  This could result in hashes having two elements with the same key [perl #91834]. (5.14.2)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Lvalue subroutines were not allowing COW scalars to be returned.  This was fixed for lvalue scalar context in Perl 5.12.3 and 5.14.0, but list context was not fixed until this release.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Elements of restricted hashes (see the fields pragma) containing copy-on-write values couldn't be deleted, nor could such hashes be cleared (&quot;%hash = ()&quot;). (5.14.2)</dd>

Localizing a tied variable used to make it read-only if it contained a copy-on-write string. (5.14.2)</dd>

Assigning a copy-on-write string to a stash element no longer causes a double free.  Regardless of this change, the results of such assignments are still undefined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Assigning a copy-on-write string to a tied variable no longer stops that variable from being tied if it happens to be a PVMG or PVLV internally.</dd>

This one is a regression from 5.12: In 5.14.0, the bitwise assignment operators &quot;|=&quot;, &quot;^=&quot; and &quot;&amp;=&quot; started leaving the left-hand side undefined if it happened to be a copy-on-write string [perl #108480].</dd>

<h2>The debugger</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>dumpvar.pl</i>, and therefore the &quot;x&quot; command in the debugger, have been fixed to handle objects blessed into classes whose names contain &quot;=&quot;.  The contents of such objects used not to be dumped [perl #101814].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;R&quot; command for restarting a debugger session has been fixed to work on Windows, or any other system lacking a &quot;POSIX::_SC_OPEN_MAX&quot; constant [perl #87740].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;#line 42 foo&quot; directive used not to update the arrays of lines used by the debugger if it occurred in a string eval.  This was partially fixed in 5.14, but it worked only for a single &quot;#line 42 foo&quot; in each eval.  Now it works for multiple.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When subroutine calls are intercepted by the debugger, the name of the subroutine or a reference to it is stored in $DB::sub, for the debugger to access.  Sometimes (such as &quot;$foo = *bar; undef *bar; &amp;$foo&quot;) $DB::sub would be set to a name that could not be used to find the subroutine, and so the debugger's attempt to call it would fail.  Now the check to see whether a reference is needed is more robust, so those problems should not happen anymore [rt.cpan.org #69862].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Every subroutine has a filename associated with it that the debugger uses. The one associated with constant subroutines used to be misallocated when cloned under threads.  Consequently, debugging threaded applications could result in memory corruption [perl #96126].</dd>

<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;defined(${&quot;...&quot;})&quot;, &quot;defined(*{&quot;...&quot;})&quot;, etc., used to return true for most, but not all built-in variables, if they had not been used yet.  This bug affected &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot; and &quot;${^UTF8CACHE}&quot;, among others.  It also used to return false if the package name was given as well (&quot;${&quot;::!&quot;}&quot;) [perl #97978, #97492].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl 5.10.0 introduced a similar bug: &quot;defined(*{&quot;foo&quot;})&quot; where &quot;foo&quot; represents the name of a built-in global variable used to return false if the variable had never been used before, but only on the  <i>first</i> call. This, too, has been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Since 5.6.0, &quot;*{ ... }&quot; has been inconsistent in how it treats undefined values.  It would die in strict mode or lvalue context for most undefined values, but would be treated as the empty string (with a warning) for the specific scalar return by &quot;undef()&quot; (&amp;PL_sv_undef internally).  This has been corrected.  &quot;undef()&quot; is now treated like other undefined scalars, as in Perl 5.005.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Filehandle, last-accessed</h2> Perl has an internal variable that stores the last filehandle to be accessed.  It is used by $. and by &quot;tell&quot; and &quot;eof&quot; without arguments.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
It used to be possible to set this internal variable to a glob copy and then modify that glob copy to be something other than a glob, and still have the last-accessed filehandle associated with the variable after assigning a glob to it again:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $foo = *STDOUT;  # $foo is a glob copy<br/>
    &lt;$foo&gt;;             # $foo is now the last-accessed handle<br/>
    $foo = 3;           # no longer a glob<br/>
    $foo = *STDERR;     # still the last-accessed handle<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Now the &quot;$foo = 3&quot; assignment unsets that internal variable, so there is no last-accessed filehandle, just as if &quot;&lt;$foo&gt;&quot; had never happened.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This also prevents some unrelated handle from becoming the last-accessed handle if $foo falls out of scope and the same internal SV gets used for another handle [perl #97988].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A regression in 5.14 caused these statements not to set that internal variable:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $fh = *STDOUT;<br/>
    tell $fh;<br/>
    eof  $fh;<br/>
    seek $fh, 0,0;<br/>
    tell     *$fh;<br/>
    eof      *$fh;<br/>
    seek     *$fh, 0,0;<br/>
    readline *$fh;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is now fixed, but &quot;tell *{ *$fh }&quot; still has the problem, and it is not clear how to fix it [perl #106536].</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Filetests and &quot;stat&quot;</h2> The term &quot;filetests&quot; refers to the operators that consist of a hyphen followed by a single letter: &quot;-r&quot;, &quot;-x&quot;, &quot;-M&quot;, etc.  The term &quot;stacked&quot; when applied to filetests means followed by another filetest operator sharing the same operand, as in &quot;-r -x -w $fooo&quot;.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;stat&quot; produces more consistent warnings.  It no longer warns for &quot;_&quot; [perl #71002] and no longer skips the warning at times for other unopened handles.  It no longer warns about an unopened handle when the operating system's &quot;fstat&quot; function fails.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;stat&quot; would sometimes return negative numbers for large inode numbers, because it was using the wrong internal C type. [perl #84590]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;lstat&quot; is documented to fall back to &quot;stat&quot; (with a warning) when given a filehandle.  When passed an IO reference, it was actually doing the equivalent of &quot;stat&#160;_&quot; and ignoring the handle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;-T _&quot; with no preceding &quot;stat&quot; used to produce a confusing &quot;uninitialized&quot; warning, even though there is no visible uninitialized value to speak of.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;-T&quot;, &quot;-B&quot;, &quot;-l&quot; and &quot;-t&quot; now work when stacked with other filetest operators [perl #77388].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In 5.14.0, filetest ops (&quot;-r&quot;, &quot;-x&quot;, etc.) started calling FETCH on a tied argument belonging to the previous argument to a list operator, if called with a bareword argument or no argument at all.  This has been fixed, so &quot;push @foo, $tied, -r&quot; no longer calls FETCH on $tied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In Perl 5.6, &quot;-l&quot; followed by anything other than a bareword would treat its argument as a file name.  That was changed in 5.8 for glob references (&quot;\*foo&quot;), but not for globs themselves (*foo).  &quot;-l&quot; started returning &quot;undef&quot; for glob references without setting the last stat buffer that the &quot;_&quot; handle uses, but only if warnings were turned on.  With warnings off, it was the same as 5.6. In other words, it was simply buggy and inconsistent.  Now the 5.6 behavior has been restored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;-l&quot; followed by a bareword no longer &quot;eats&quot; the previous argument to the list operator in whose argument list it resides.  Hence, &quot;print &quot;bar&quot;, -l foo&quot; now actually prints &quot;bar&quot;, because &quot;-l&quot; on longer eats it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl keeps several internal variables to keep track of the last stat buffer, from which file(handle) it originated, what type it was, and whether the last stat succeeded.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There were various cases where these could get out of synch, resulting in inconsistent or erratic behavior in edge cases (every mention of &quot;-T&quot; applies to &quot;-B&quot; as well):</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;-T <i>HANDLE</i>&quot;, even though it does a &quot;stat&quot;, was not resetting the last stat type, so an &quot;lstat _&quot; following it would merrily return the wrong results.  Also, it was not setting the success status.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Freeing the handle last used by &quot;stat&quot; or a filetest could result in &quot;-T&#160;_&quot; using an unrelated handle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;stat&quot; with an IO reference would not reset the stat type or record the filehandle for &quot;-T&#160;_&quot; to use.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Fatal warnings could cause the stat buffer not to be reset for a filetest operator on an unopened filehandle or &quot;-l&quot; on any handle. Fatal warnings also stopped &quot;-T&quot; from setting $!.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When the last stat was on an unreadable file, &quot;-T _&quot; is supposed to return &quot;undef&quot;, leaving the last stat buffer unchanged.  But it was setting the stat type, causing &quot;lstat _&quot; to stop working.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>
&quot;-T <i>FILENAME</i>&quot; was not resetting the internal stat buffers for unreadable files.</dd>

Several edge cases have been fixed with formats and &quot;formline&quot;; in particular, where the format itself is potentially variable (such as with ties and overloading), and where the format and data differ in their encoding.

<h2>The &quot;glob&quot; operator</h2><dl>
<dt>

<dd>
On OSes other than VMS, Perl's &quot;glob&quot; operator (and the &quot;&lt;...&gt;&quot; form) use File::Glob underneath.  File::Glob splits the pattern into words, before feeding each word to its &quot;bsd_glob&quot; function.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There were several inconsistencies in the way the split was done.  Now quotation marks (' and &quot;) are always treated as shell-style word delimiters (that allow whitespace as part of a word) and backslashes are always preserved, unless they exist to escape quotation marks.  Before, those would only sometimes be the case, depending on whether the pattern contained whitespace.  Also, escaped whitespace at the end of the pattern is no longer stripped [perl #40470].</dd>

Explicit return now returns the actual argument passed to return, instead of copying it [perl #72724, #72706].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Lvalue subroutines used to enforce lvalue syntax (i.e., whatever can go on the left-hand side of &quot;=&quot;) for the last statement and the arguments to return.  Since lvalue subroutines are not always called in lvalue context, this restriction has been lifted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

Lvalue subroutines are less restrictive about what values can be returned. It used to croak on values returned by &quot;shift&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; and from other subroutines, but no longer does so [perl #71172].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Empty lvalue subroutines (&quot;sub :lvalue {}&quot;) used to return @_ in list context.  All subroutines used to do this, but regular subs were fixed in Perl 5.8.2.  Now lvalue subroutines have been likewise fixed.</dd>
</dl>

Autovivification now works on values returned from lvalue subroutines [perl #7946], as does returning &quot;keys&quot; in lvalue context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Lvalue subroutines used to copy their return values in rvalue context.  Not only was this a waste of CPU cycles, but it also caused bugs.  A &quot;($)&quot; prototype would cause an lvalue sub to copy its return value [perl #51408], and &quot;while(lvalue_sub() =~ m/.../g) { ... }&quot; would loop endlessly [perl #78680].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When called in potential lvalue context (e.g., subroutine arguments or a list passed to &quot;for&quot;), lvalue subroutines used to copy any read-only value that was returned.  E.g., &quot; sub :lvalue { $] } &quot; would not return $], but a copy of it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When called in potential lvalue context, an lvalue subroutine returning arrays or hashes used to bind the arrays or hashes to scalar variables, resulting in bugs.  This was fixed in 5.14.0 if an array were the first thing returned from the subroutine (but not for &quot;$scalar, @array&quot; or hashes being returned).  Now a more general fix has been applied [perl #23790].</dd>

<dd>
Method calls whose arguments were all surrounded with &quot;my()&quot; or &quot;our()&quot; (as in &quot;$object-&gt;method(my($a,$b))&quot;) used to force lvalue context on the subroutine.  This would prevent lvalue methods from returning certain values.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>
Lvalue sub calls that are not determined to be such at compile time (&amp;$name or &amp;{&quot;name&quot;}) are no longer exempt from strict refs if they occur in the last statement of an lvalue subroutine [perl #102486].</dd>

Sub calls whose subs are not visible at compile time, if they occurred in the last statement of an lvalue subroutine, would reject non-lvalue subroutines and die with &quot;Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call&quot; [perl #102486].<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Non-lvalue sub calls whose subs <i>are</i> visible at compile time exhibited the opposite bug.  If the call occurred in the last statement of an lvalue subroutine, there would be no error when the lvalue sub was called in lvalue context.  Perl would blindly assign to the temporary value returned by the non-lvalue subroutine.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; routines used to take precedence over the actual sub being called (i.e., when autoloading wasn't needed), for sub calls in lvalue or potential lvalue context, if the subroutine was not visible at compile time.</dd>

Applying the &quot;:lvalue&quot; attribute to an XSUB or to an aliased subroutine stub with &quot;sub foo :lvalue;&quot; syntax stopped working in Perl 5.12. This has been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Applying the :lvalue attribute to subroutine that is already defined does not work properly, as the attribute changes the way the sub is compiled. Hence, Perl 5.12 began warning when an attempt is made to apply the attribute to an already defined sub.  In such cases, the attribute is discarded.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
But the change in 5.12 missed the case where custom attributes are also present: that case still silently and ineffectively applied the attribute. That omission has now been corrected.  &quot;sub foo :lvalue :Whatever&quot; (when &quot;foo&quot; is already defined) now warns about the :lvalue attribute, and does not apply it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A bug affecting lvalue context propagation through nested lvalue subroutine calls has been fixed.  Previously, returning a value in nested rvalue context would be treated as lvalue context by the inner subroutine call, resulting in some values (such as read-only values) being rejected.</dd>

The known bugs that were introduced in 5.14 have now been fixed; as well as some other edge cases that have never worked until now.

For lvalue subroutines, it no longer tries to return the sub as a scalar, resulting in strange side effects like &quot;ref \$_&quot; returning &quot;CODE&quot; in some instances.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

&quot;lock &amp;sub&quot; is now a run-time error if threads::shared is loaded (a no-op otherwise), but that may be rectified in a future version.</dd>

When Perl autovivifies an element of a tied array or hash (which entails calling STORE with a new reference), it now calls FETCH immediately after the STORE, instead of assuming that FETCH would have returned the same reference.

A bug has been fixed that occurs when a tied variable is used as a subroutine reference:  if the last thing assigned to or returned from the variable was a reference or typeglob, the &quot;\&amp;$tied&quot; could either crash or return the wrong subroutine.

<h2>Version objects and vstrings</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The bitwise complement operator (and possibly other operators, too) when passed a vstring would leave vstring magic attached to the return value, even though the string had changed.  This meant that &quot;version-&gt;new(~v1.2.3)&quot; would create a version looking like &quot;v1.2.3&quot; even though the string passed to &quot;version-&gt;new&quot; was actually &quot;\376\375\374&quot;.  This also caused B::Deparse to deparse &quot;~v1.2.3&quot; incorrectly, without the &quot;~&quot; [perl #29070].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

Assigning a vstring to a magic (e.g., tied, $!) variable and then assigning something else used to blow away all magic.

This has been fixed.</dd>

<h2>Warnings, redefinition</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Subroutines from the &quot;autouse&quot; namespace are once more exempt from redefinition warnings.  This used to work in 5.005, but was broken in 5.6 for most subroutines.  For subs created via XS that redefine subroutines from the &quot;autouse&quot; package, this stopped working in 5.10.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
New XSUBs now produce redefinition warnings if they overwrite existing subs, as they did in 5.8.x.  (The &quot;autouse&quot; logic was reversed in 5.10-14.  Only subroutines from the &quot;autouse&quot; namespace would warn when clobbered.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;newCONSTSUB&quot; used to use compile-time warning hints, instead of run-time hints.  The following code should never produce a redefinition warning, but it used to, if &quot;newCONSTSUB&quot; redefined an existing subroutine:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use warnings;<br/>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Redefinition warnings for constant subroutines are on by default (what are known as severe warnings in perldiag).  This occurred only when it was a glob assignment or declaration of a Perl subroutine that caused the warning.  If the creation of XSUBs triggered the warning, it was not a default warning.  This has been corrected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The internal check to see whether a redefinition warning should occur used to emit &quot;uninitialized&quot; warnings in cases like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h2>Weak references</h2><dl>

Creating a weak reference to an @ISA array or accessing the array index ($#ISA) could result in confused internal bookkeeping for elements later added to the @ISA array.

Perl skips copying values returned from a subroutine, for the sake of speed, if doing so would make no observable difference.

For list assignments like &quot;($a,$b) = ($b,$a)&quot;, Perl has to make a copy of the items on the right-hand side before assignment them to the left.  For efficiency's sake, it assigns the values on the right straight to the items on the left if no one variable is mentioned on both sides, as in &quot;($a,$b) = ($c,$d)&quot;.  The logic for determining when it can cheat was faulty, in that &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; and &quot;||&quot; on the right-hand side could fool it.  So &quot;($a,$b) = $some_true_value &amp;&amp; ($b,$a)&quot; would end up assigning the value of $b to both scalars.</dd>

Perl no longer tries to apply lvalue context to the string in &quot;(&quot;string&quot;, $variable) ||= 1&quot; (which used to be an error).

<h1>Known Problems</h1><dl>

<dd>
On Solaris, we have two kinds of failure.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If <i>make</i> is Sun's <i>make</i>, we get an error about a badly formed macro assignment in the  <i>Makefile</i>.  That happens when <i>./Configure</i> tries to make depends.   <i>Configure</i> then exits 0, but further <i>make</i>-ing fails.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If <i>make</i> is <i>gmake</i>, <i>Configure</i> completes, then we get errors related to  <i>/usr/include/stdbool.h</i></dd>

On Win32, a number of tests hang unless STDERR is redirected.  The cause of this is still under investigation.</dd>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When building as root with a umask that prevents files from being other-readable,  <i>t/op/filetest.t</i> will fail.  This is a test bug, not a bug in perl's behavior.</dd>

Configuring with a recent gcc and link-time-optimization, such as &quot;Configure -Doptimize='-O2 -flto'&quot; fails because the optimizer optimizes away some of Configure's tests.  A workaround is to omit the &quot;-flto&quot; flag when running Configure, but add it back in while actually building, something like<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sh Configure -Doptimize=-O2                                             <br/>
    make OPTIMIZE='-O2 -flto'<br/>

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at &lt;http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/&gt;.  There may also be information at &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt;, the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please use this address only for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</div>
