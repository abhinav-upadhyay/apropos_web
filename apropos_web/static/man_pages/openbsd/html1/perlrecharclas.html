<h1>NAME</h1> perlrecharclass - Perl Regular Expression Character Classes</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The top level documentation about Perl regular expressions is found in perlre.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This manual page discusses the syntax and use of character classes in Perl regular expressions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A character class is a way of denoting a set of characters in such a way that one character of the set is matched. It's important to remember that: matching a character class consumes exactly one character in the source string. (The source string is the string the regular expression is matched against.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are three types of character classes in Perl regular expressions: the dot, backslash sequences, and the form enclosed in square brackets.  Keep in mind, though, that often the term &quot;character class&quot; is used to mean just the bracketed form.  Certainly, most Perl documentation does that.<div class="subsection">
<h2>The dot</h2> The dot (or period), &quot;.&quot; is probably the most used, and certainly the most well-known character class. By default, a dot matches any character, except for the newline. That default can be changed to add matching the newline by using the  <i>single line</i> modifier: either for the entire regular expression with the &quot;/s&quot; modifier, or locally with &quot;(?s)&quot;.  (The &quot;\N&quot; backslash sequence, described below, matches any character except newline without regard to the  <i>single line</i> modifier.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here are some examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /./       # Match<br/>
 &quot;.&quot;  =~  /./       # Match<br/>
 &quot;&quot;   =~  /./       # No match (dot has to match a character)<br/>
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /./       # No match (dot does not match a newline)<br/>
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /./s      # Match (global 'single line' modifier)<br/>
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /(?s:.)/  # Match (local 'single line' modifier)<br/>
 &quot;ab&quot; =~  /^.$/     # No match (dot matches one character)<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Backslash sequences</h2> A backslash sequence is a sequence of characters, the first one of which is a backslash.  Perl ascribes special meaning to many such sequences, and some of these are character classes.  That is, they match a single character each, provided that the character belongs to the specific set of characters defined by the sequence.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here's a list of the backslash sequences that are character classes.  They are discussed in more detail below.  (For the backslash sequences that aren't character classes, see perlrebackslash.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 \d             Match a decimal digit character.<br/>
 \D             Match a non-decimal-digit character.<br/>
 \w             Match a &quot;word&quot; character.<br/>
 \W             Match a non-&quot;word&quot; character.<br/>
 \s             Match a whitespace character.<br/>
 \S             Match a non-whitespace character.<br/>
 \h             Match a horizontal whitespace character.<br/>
 \H             Match a character that isn't horizontal whitespace.<br/>
 \v             Match a vertical whitespace character.<br/>
 \V             Match a character that isn't vertical whitespace.<br/>
 \N             Match a character that isn't a newline.<br/>
 \pP, \p{Prop}  Match a character that has the given Unicode property.<br/>
 \PP, \P{Prop}  Match a character that doesn't have the Unicode property<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>\N</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\N&quot;, available starting in v5.12, like the dot, matches any character that is not a newline. The difference is that &quot;\N&quot; is not influenced by the  <i>single line</i> regular expression modifier (see &quot;The dot&quot; above).  Note that the form &quot;\N{...}&quot; may mean something completely different.  When the &quot;{...}&quot; is a quantifier, it means to match a non-newline character that many times.  For example, &quot;\N{3}&quot; means to match 3 non-newlines; &quot;\N{5,}&quot; means to match 5 or more non-newlines.  But if &quot;{...}&quot; is not a legal quantifier, it is presumed to be a named character.  See charnames for those.  For example, none of &quot;\N{COLON}&quot;, &quot;\N{4F}&quot;, and &quot;\N{F4}&quot; contain legal quantifiers, so Perl will try to find characters whose names are respectively &quot;COLON&quot;, &quot;4F&quot;, and &quot;F4&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Digits</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\d&quot; matches a single character considered to be a decimal <i>digit</i>. If the &quot;/a&quot; regular expression modifier is in effect, it matches [0-9]. Otherwise, it matches anything that is matched by &quot;\p{Digit}&quot;, which includes [0-9]. (An unlikely possible exception is that under locale matching rules, the current locale might not have &quot;[0-9]&quot; matched by &quot;\d&quot;, and/or might match other characters whose code point is less than 256.  The only such locale definitions that are legal would be to match &quot;[0-9]&quot; plus another set of 10 consecutive digit characters;  anything else would be in violation of the C language standard, but Perl doesn't currently assume anything in regard to this.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
What this means is that unless the &quot;/a&quot; modifier is in effect &quot;\d&quot; not only matches the digits '0' - '9', but also Arabic, Devanagari, and digits from other languages.  This may cause some confusion, and some security issues.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some digits that &quot;\d&quot; matches look like some of the [0-9] ones, but have different values.  For example, BENGALI DIGIT FOUR (U+09EA) looks very much like an ASCII DIGIT EIGHT (U+0038).  An application that is expecting only the ASCII digits might be misled, or if the match is &quot;\d+&quot;, the matched string might contain a mixture of digits from different writing systems that look like they signify a number different than they actually do.  &quot; <i>num()</i>&quot; in Unicode::UCD can be used to safely calculate the value, returning &quot;undef&quot; if the input string contains such a mixture.<div class="spacer">
</div>
What &quot;\p{Digit}&quot; means (and hence &quot;\d&quot; except under the &quot;/a&quot; modifier) is &quot;\p{General_Category=Decimal_Number}&quot;, or synonymously, &quot;\p{General_Category=Digit}&quot;.  Starting with Unicode version 4.1, this is the same set of characters matched by &quot;\p{Numeric_Type=Decimal}&quot;. But Unicode also has a different property with a similar name, &quot;\p{Numeric_Type=Digit}&quot;, which matches a completely different set of characters.  These characters are things such as &quot;CIRCLED DIGIT ONE&quot; or subscripts, or are from writing systems that lack all ten digits.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The design intent is for &quot;\d&quot; to exactly match the set of characters that can safely be used with &quot;normal&quot; big-endian positional decimal syntax, where, for example 123 means one 'hundred', plus two 'tens', plus three 'ones'.  This positional notation does not necessarily apply to characters that match the other type of &quot;digit&quot;, &quot;\p{Numeric_Type=Digit}&quot;, and so &quot;\d&quot; doesn't match them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Tamil digits (U+0BE6 - U+0BEF) can also legally be used in old-style Tamil numbers in which they would appear no more than one in a row, separated by characters that mean &quot;times 10&quot;, &quot;times 100&quot;, etc.  (See &lt;http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn21&gt;.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any character not matched by &quot;\d&quot; is matched by &quot;\D&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Word characters</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
A &quot;\w&quot; matches a single alphanumeric character (an alphabetic character, or a decimal digit); or a connecting punctuation character, such as an underscore (&quot;_&quot;); or a &quot;mark&quot; character (like some sort of accent) that attaches to one of those.  It does not match a whole word.  To match a whole word, use &quot;\w+&quot;.  This isn't the same thing as matching an English word, but in the ASCII range it is the same as a string of Perl-identifier characters.<dl>

Also, for a somewhat finer-grained set of characters that are in programming language identifiers beyond the ASCII range, you may wish to instead use the more customized &quot;Unicode Properties&quot;, &quot;\p{ID_Start}&quot;, &quot;\p{ID_Continue}&quot;, &quot;\p{XID_Start}&quot;, and &quot;\p{XID_Continue}&quot;.

In all Perl versions, &quot;\s&quot; matches the 5 characters [\t\n\f\r ]; that is, the horizontal tab, the newline, the form feed, the carriage return, and the space.

&quot;\h&quot; matches any character considered horizontal whitespace; this includes the platform's space and tab characters and several others listed in the table below.  &quot;\H&quot; matches any character not considered horizontal whitespace.

&quot;\v&quot; matches any character considered vertical whitespace; this includes the platform's carriage return and line feed characters (newline) plus several other characters, all listed in the table below. &quot;\V&quot; matches any character not considered vertical whitespace. They use the platform's native character set, and do not consider any locale that may otherwise be in use.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\R&quot; matches anything that can be considered a newline under Unicode rules. It's not a character class, as it can match a multi-character sequence. Therefore, it cannot be used inside a bracketed character class; use &quot;\v&quot; instead (vertical whitespace).  It uses the platform's native character set, and does not consider any locale that may otherwise be in use. Details are discussed in perlrebackslash.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that unlike &quot;\s&quot; (and &quot;\d&quot; and &quot;\w&quot;), &quot;\h&quot; and &quot;\v&quot; always match the same characters, without regard to other factors, such as the active locale or whether the source string is in UTF-8 format.<div class="spacer">

One might think that &quot;\s&quot; is equivalent to &quot;[\h\v]&quot;. This is indeed true starting in Perl v5.18, but prior to that, the sole difference was that the vertical tab (&quot;\cK&quot;) was not matched by &quot;\s&quot;.<div class="spacer">

Prior to Perl v5.18, &quot;\s&quot; did not match the vertical tab.  The change in v5.18 is considered an experiment, which means it could be backed out in v5.22 if experience indicates that it breaks too much existing code.  If this change adversely affects you, send email to &quot;perlbug@perl.org&quot;; if it affects you positively, email &quot;perlthanks@perl.org&quot;.

</div>
<i>Unicode Properties</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\pP&quot; and &quot;\p{Prop}&quot; are character classes to match characters that fit given Unicode properties.  One letter property names can be used in the &quot;\pP&quot; form, with the property name following the &quot;\p&quot;, otherwise, braces are required. When using braces, there is a single form, which is just the property name enclosed in the braces, and a compound form which looks like &quot;\p{name=value}&quot;, which means to match if the property &quot;name&quot; for the character has that particular &quot;value&quot;. For instance, a match for a number can be written as &quot;/\pN/&quot; or as &quot;/\p{Number}/&quot;, or as &quot;/\p{Number=True}/&quot;. Lowercase letters are matched by the property  <i>Lowercase_Letter</i> which has the short form  <i>Ll</i>. They need the braces, so are written as &quot;/\p{Ll}/&quot; or &quot;/\p{Lowercase_Letter}/&quot;, or &quot;/\p{General_Category=Lowercase_Letter}/&quot; (the underscores are optional). &quot;/\pLl/&quot; is valid, but means something different. It matches a two character string: a letter (Unicode property &quot;\pL&quot;), followed by a lowercase &quot;l&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If locale rules are not in effect, the use of a Unicode property will force the regular expression into using Unicode rules, if it isn't already.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that almost all properties are immune to case-insensitive matching. That is, adding a &quot;/i&quot; regular expression modifier does not change what they match.  There are two sets that are affected.  The first set is &quot;Uppercase_Letter&quot;, &quot;Lowercase_Letter&quot;, and &quot;Titlecase_Letter&quot;, all of which match &quot;Cased_Letter&quot; under &quot;/i&quot; matching. The second set is &quot;Uppercase&quot;, &quot;Lowercase&quot;, and &quot;Titlecase&quot;, all of which match &quot;Cased&quot; under &quot;/i&quot; matching. (The difference between these sets is that some things, such as Roman numerals, come in both upper and lower case, so they are &quot;Cased&quot;, but aren't considered to be letters, so they aren't &quot;Cased_Letter&quot;s. They're actually &quot;Letter_Number&quot;s.) This set also includes its subsets &quot;PosixUpper&quot; and &quot;PosixLower&quot;, both of which under &quot;/i&quot; match &quot;PosixAlpha&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For more details on Unicode properties, see &quot;Unicode Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode; for a complete list of possible properties, see &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops, which notes all forms that have &quot;/i&quot; differences. It is also possible to define your own properties. This is discussed in &quot;User-Defined Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unicode properties are defined (surprise!) only on Unicode code points. Starting in v5.20, when matching against &quot;\p&quot; and &quot;\P&quot;, Perl treats non-Unicode code points (those above the legal Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF) as if they were typical unassigned Unicode code points.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Prior to v5.20, Perl raised a warning and made all matches fail on non-Unicode code points.  This could be somewhat surprising:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=True}     # Fails on Perls &lt; v5.20.<br/>
 chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=False}    # Also fails on Perls<br/>
                                               # &lt; v5.20<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Even though these two matches might be thought of as complements, until v5.20 they were so only on Unicode code points.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\w/      # Match, &quot;a&quot; is a 'word' character.<br/>
 &quot;7&quot;  =~  /\w/      # Match, &quot;7&quot; is a 'word' character as well.<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\d/      # No match, &quot;a&quot; isn't a digit.<br/>

 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\D/      # Match, &quot;a&quot; is a non-digit.<br/>
 &quot;7&quot;  =~  /\D/      # No match, &quot;7&quot; is not a non-digit.<br/>
 &quot; &quot;  =~  /\S/      # No match, a space is not non-whitespace.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot; &quot;  =~  /\h/      # Match, space is horizontal whitespace.<br/>
 &quot; &quot;  =~  /\v/      # No match, space is not vertical whitespace.<br/>
 &quot;\r&quot; =~  /\v/      # Match, a return is vertical whitespace.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\pL/     # Match, &quot;a&quot; is a letter.<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\p{Lu}/  # No match, /\p{Lu}/ matches upper case letters.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;\x{0e0b}&quot; =~ /\p{Thai}/  # Match, \x{0e0b} is the character<br/>
                           # 'THAI CHARACTER SO SO', and that's in<br/>
                           # Thai Unicode class.<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\P{Lao}/ # Match, as &quot;a&quot; is not a Laotian character.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is worth emphasizing that &quot;\d&quot;, &quot;\w&quot;, etc, match single characters, not complete numbers or words. To match a number (that consists of digits), use &quot;\d+&quot;; to match a word, use &quot;\w+&quot;.  But be aware of the security considerations in doing so, as mentioned above.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Bracketed Character Classes</h2> The third form of character class you can use in Perl regular expressions is the bracketed character class.  In its simplest form, it lists the characters that may be matched, surrounded by square brackets, like this: &quot;[aeiou]&quot;. This matches one of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot;.  Like the other character classes, exactly one character is matched.* To match a longer string consisting of characters mentioned in the character class, follow the character class with a quantifier.  For instance, &quot;[aeiou]+&quot; matches one or more lowercase English vowels.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Repeating a character in a character class has no effect; it's considered to be in the set only once.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;e&quot;  =~  /[aeiou]/        # Match, as &quot;e&quot; is listed in the class.<br/>
 &quot;p&quot;  =~  /[aeiou]/        # No match, &quot;p&quot; is not listed in the class.<br/>
 &quot;ae&quot; =~  /^[aeiou]$/      # No match, a character class only matches<br/>
                           # a single character.<br/>
 &quot;ae&quot; =~  /^[aeiou]+$/     # Match, due to the quantifier.<br/>

<div class="spacer">
</div>
* There is an exception to a bracketed character class matching a single character only.  When the class is to match caselessly under &quot;/i&quot; matching rules, and a character that is explicitly mentioned inside the class matches a multiple-character sequence caselessly under Unicode rules, the class (when not inverted) will also match that sequence.  For example, Unicode says that the letter &quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S&quot; should match the sequence &quot;ss&quot; under &quot;/i&quot; rules.  Thus,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 'ss' =~ /\A\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}\z/i             # Matches<br/>
 'ss' =~ /\A[aeioust\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}]\z/i    # Matches<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For this to happen, the character must be explicitly specified, and not be part of a multi-character range (not even as one of its endpoints). (&quot;Character Ranges&quot; will be explained shortly.)  Therefore,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 'ss' =~ /\A[\0-\x{ff}]\z/i        # Doesn't match<br/>
 'ss' =~ /\A[\0-\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}]\z/i    # No match<br/>
 'ss' =~ /\A[\xDF-\xDF]\z/i    # Matches on ASCII platforms, since \XDF<br/>
                               # is LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S, and the<br/>
                               # range is just a single element<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that it isn't a good idea to specify these types of ranges anyway.<div class="spacer">

<i>Special Characters Inside a Bracketed Character Class</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Most characters that are meta characters in regular expressions (that is, characters that carry a special meaning like &quot;.&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, or &quot;(&quot;) lose their special meaning and can be used inside a character class without the need to escape them. For instance, &quot;[()]&quot; matches either an opening parenthesis, or a closing parenthesis, and the parens inside the character class don't group or capture.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Characters that may carry a special meaning inside a character class are: &quot;\&quot;, &quot;^&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;, and are discussed below. They can be escaped with a backslash, although this is sometimes not needed, in which case the backslash may be omitted.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The sequence &quot;\b&quot; is special inside a bracketed character class. While outside the character class, &quot;\b&quot; is an assertion indicating a point that does not have either two word characters or two non-word characters on either side, inside a bracketed character class, &quot;\b&quot; matches a backspace character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The sequences &quot;\a&quot;, &quot;\c&quot;, &quot;\e&quot;, &quot;\f&quot;, &quot;\n&quot;, &quot;\N{ <i>NAME</i>}&quot;, &quot;\N{U+ <i>hex char</i>}&quot;, &quot;\r&quot;, &quot;\t&quot;, and &quot;\x&quot; are also special and have the same meanings as they do outside a bracketed character class.  (However, inside a bracketed character class, if &quot;\N{ <i>NAME</i>}&quot; expands to a sequence of characters, only the first one in the sequence is used, with a warning.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Also, a backslash followed by two or three octal digits is considered an octal number.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A &quot;[&quot; is not special inside a character class, unless it's the start of a POSIX character class (see &quot;POSIX Character Classes&quot; below). It normally does not need escaping.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A &quot;]&quot; is normally either the end of a POSIX character class (see &quot;POSIX Character Classes&quot; below), or it signals the end of the bracketed character class.  If you want to include a &quot;]&quot; in the set of characters, you must generally escape it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, if the &quot;]&quot; is the <i>first</i> (or the second if the first character is a caret) character of a bracketed character class, it does not denote the end of the class (as you cannot have an empty class) and is considered part of the set of characters that can be matched without escaping.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;+&quot;   =~ /[+?*]/     #  Match, &quot;+&quot; in a character class is not special.<br/>
 &quot;\cH&quot; =~ /[\b]/      #  Match, \b inside in a character class.<br/>
                      #  is equivalent to a backspace.<br/>
 &quot;]&quot;   =~ /[][]/      #  Match, as the character class contains.<br/>
                      #  both [ and ].<br/>
 &quot;[]&quot;  =~ /[[]]/      #  Match, the pattern contains a character class<br/>
                      #  containing just ], and the character class is<br/>
                      #  followed by a ].<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Character Ranges</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
It is not uncommon to want to match a range of characters. Luckily, instead of listing all characters in the range, one may use the hyphen (&quot;-&quot;). If inside a bracketed character class you have two characters separated by a hyphen, it's treated as if all characters between the two were in the class. For instance, &quot;[0-9]&quot; matches any ASCII digit, and &quot;[a-m]&quot; matches any lowercase letter from the first half of the ASCII alphabet.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that the two characters on either side of the hyphen are not necessarily both letters or both digits. Any character is possible, although not advisable.  &quot;['-?]&quot; contains a range of characters, but most people will not know which characters that means.  Furthermore, such ranges may lead to portability problems if the code has to run on a platform that uses a different character set, such as EBCDIC.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a hyphen in a character class cannot syntactically be part of a range, for instance because it is the first or the last character of the character class, or if it immediately follows a range, the hyphen isn't special, and so is considered a character to be matched literally.  If you want a hyphen in your set of characters to be matched and its position in the class is such that it could be considered part of a range, you must escape that hyphen with a backslash.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 [a-z]       #  Matches a character that is a lower case ASCII letter.<br/>
 [a-fz]      #  Matches any letter between 'a' and 'f' (inclusive) or<br/>
             #  the letter 'z'.<br/>
 [-z]        #  Matches either a hyphen ('-') or the letter 'z'.<br/>
 [a-f-m]     #  Matches any letter between 'a' and 'f' (inclusive), the<br/>
             #  hyphen ('-'), or the letter 'm'.<br/>
 ['-?]       #  Matches any of the characters  '()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?<br/>
             #  (But not on an EBCDIC platform).<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Negation</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
It is also possible to instead list the characters you do not want to match. You can do so by using a caret (&quot;^&quot;) as the first character in the character class. For instance, &quot;[^a-z]&quot; matches any character that is not a lowercase ASCII letter, which therefore includes more than a million Unicode code points.  The class is said to be &quot;negated&quot; or &quot;inverted&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This syntax make the caret a special character inside a bracketed character class, but only if it is the first character of the class. So if you want the caret as one of the characters to match, either escape the caret or else don't list it first.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In inverted bracketed character classes, Perl ignores the Unicode rules that normally say that certain characters should match a sequence of multiple characters under caseless &quot;/i&quot; matching.  Following those rules could lead to highly confusing situations:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;ss&quot; =~ /^[^\xDF]+$/ui;   # Matches!<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This should match any sequences of characters that aren't &quot;\xDF&quot; nor what &quot;\xDF&quot; matches under &quot;/i&quot;.  &quot;s&quot; isn't &quot;\xDF&quot;, but Unicode says that &quot;ss&quot; is what &quot;\xDF&quot; matches under &quot;/i&quot;.  So which one &quot;wins&quot;? Do you fail the match because the string has &quot;ss&quot; or accept it because it has an &quot;s&quot; followed by another &quot;s&quot;?  Perl has chosen the latter.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;e&quot;  =~  /[^aeiou]/   #  No match, the 'e' is listed.<br/>
 &quot;x&quot;  =~  /[^aeiou]/   #  Match, as 'x' isn't a lowercase vowel.<br/>
 &quot;^&quot;  =~  /[^^]/       #  No match, matches anything that isn't a caret.<br/>
 &quot;^&quot;  =~  /[x^]/       #  Match, caret is not special here.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Backslash Sequences</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
You can put any backslash sequence character class (with the exception of &quot;\N&quot; and &quot;\R&quot;) inside a bracketed character class, and it will act just as if you had put all characters matched by the backslash sequence inside the character class. For instance, &quot;[a-f\d]&quot; matches any decimal digit, or any of the lowercase letters between 'a' and 'f' inclusive.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\N&quot; within a bracketed character class must be of the forms &quot;\N{<i>name</i>}&quot; or &quot;\N{U+ <i>hex char</i>}&quot;, and NOT be the form that matches non-newlines, for the same reason that a dot &quot;.&quot; inside a bracketed character class loses its special meaning: it matches nearly anything, which generally isn't what you want to happen.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /[\p{Thai}\d]/     # Matches a character that is either a Thai<br/>
                    # character, or a digit.<br/>
 /[^\p{Arabic}()]/  # Matches a character that is neither an Arabic<br/>
                    # character, nor a parenthesis.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Backslash sequence character classes cannot form one of the endpoints of a range.  Thus, you can't say:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /[\p{Thai}-\d]/     # Wrong!<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>POSIX Character Classes</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
POSIX character classes have the form &quot;[:class:]&quot;, where <i>class</i> is the name, and the &quot;[:&quot; and &quot;:]&quot; delimiters. POSIX character classes only appear  <i>inside</i> bracketed character classes, and are a convenient and descriptive way of listing a group of characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Be careful about the syntax,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 # Correct:<br/>
 $string =~ /[[:alpha:]]/<br/>
<br/>
 # Incorrect (will warn):<br/>
 $string =~ /[:alpha:]/<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The latter pattern would be a character class consisting of a colon, and the letters &quot;a&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;h&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
POSIX character classes can be part of a larger bracketed character class. For example,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 [01[:alpha:]%]<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
is valid and matches '0', '1', any alphabetic character, and the percent sign.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl recognizes the following POSIX character classes:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 alpha  Any alphabetical character (&quot;[A-Za-z]&quot;).<br/>
 alnum  Any alphanumeric character (&quot;[A-Za-z0-9]&quot;).<br/>
 ascii  Any character in the ASCII character set.<br/>
 blank  A GNU extension, equal to a space or a horizontal tab (&quot;\t&quot;).<br/>
 cntrl  Any control character.  See Note [2] below.<br/>
 digit  Any decimal digit (&quot;[0-9]&quot;), equivalent to &quot;\d&quot;.<br/>
 graph  Any printable character, excluding a space.  See Note [3] below.<br/>
 lower  Any lowercase character (&quot;[a-z]&quot;).<br/>
 print  Any printable character, including a space.  See Note [4] below.<br/>
 punct  Any graphical character excluding &quot;word&quot; characters.  Note [5].<br/>
 space  Any whitespace character. &quot;\s&quot; including the vertical tab<br/>
        (&quot;\cK&quot;).<br/>
 upper  Any uppercase character (&quot;[A-Z]&quot;).<br/>
 word   A Perl extension (&quot;[A-Za-z0-9_]&quot;), equivalent to &quot;\w&quot;.<br/>
 xdigit Any hexadecimal digit (&quot;[0-9a-fA-F]&quot;).<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Most POSIX character classes have two Unicode-style &quot;\p&quot; property counterparts.  (They are not official Unicode properties, but Perl extensions derived from official Unicode properties.)  The table below shows the relation between POSIX character classes and these counterparts.<div class="spacer">
</div>
One counterpart, in the column labelled &quot;ASCII-range Unicode&quot; in the table, matches only characters in the ASCII character set.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The other counterpart, in the column labelled &quot;Full-range Unicode&quot;, matches any appropriate characters in the full Unicode character set.  For example, &quot;\p{Alpha}&quot; matches not just the ASCII alphabetic characters, but any character in the entire Unicode character set considered alphabetic. An entry in the column labelled &quot;backslash sequence&quot; is a (short) equivalent.<div class="spacer">

Control characters don't produce output as such, but instead usually control the terminal somehow: for example, newline and backspace are control characters. In the ASCII range, characters whose code points are between 0 and 31 inclusive, plus 127 (&quot;DEL&quot;) are control characters.</dd>

&quot;\p{PosixPunct}&quot; and &quot;[[:punct:]]&quot; in the ASCII range match all non-controls, non-alphanumeric, non-space characters: &quot;[-!&quot;#$%&amp;'()*+,./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\\]^_`{|}~]&quot; (although if a locale is in effect, it could alter the behavior of &quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The similarly named property, &quot;\p{Punct}&quot;, matches a somewhat different set in the ASCII range, namely &quot;[-!&quot;#%&amp;'()*,./:;?@[\\\]_{}]&quot;.  That is, it is missing the nine characters &quot;[$+&lt;=&gt;^`|~]&quot;. This is because Unicode splits what POSIX considers to be punctuation into two categories, Punctuation and Symbols.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;\p{XPosixPunct}&quot; and (under Unicode rules) &quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;, match what &quot;\p{PosixPunct}&quot; matches in the ASCII range, plus what &quot;\p{Punct}&quot; matches.  This is different than strictly matching according to &quot;\p{Punct}&quot;.  Another way to say it is that if Unicode rules are in effect, &quot;[[:punct:]]&quot; matches all characters that Unicode considers punctuation, plus all ASCII-range characters that Unicode considers symbols.</dd>

<div class="spacer">

There are various other synonyms that can be used besides the names listed in the table.  For example, &quot;\p{PosixAlpha}&quot; can be written as &quot;\p{Alpha}&quot;.  All are listed in &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops.<div class="spacer">

Both the &quot;\p&quot; counterparts always assume Unicode rules are in effect. On ASCII platforms, this means they assume that the code points from 128 to 255 are Latin-1, and that means that using them under locale rules is unwise unless the locale is guaranteed to be Latin-1 or UTF-8.  In contrast, the POSIX character classes are useful under locale rules.  They are affected by the actual rules in effect, as follows:<dl>

Negation of POSIX character classes<div class="spacer">
</div>
A Perl extension to the POSIX character class is the ability to negate it. This is done by prefixing the class name with a caret (&quot;^&quot;). Some examples:<div class="spacer">

<br/>
 &amp;    intersection<br/>
 +    union<br/>
 |    another name for '+', hence means union<br/>
 -    subtraction (the result matches the set consisting of those<br/>
      code points matched by the first operand, excluding any that<br/>
      are also matched by the second operand)<br/>
 ^    symmetric difference (the union minus the intersection).  This<br/>
      is like an exclusive or, in that the result is the set of code<br/>
      points that are matched by either, but not both, of the<br/>
      operands.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is one unary operator:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 !    complement<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
All the binary operators left associate, and are of equal precedence. The unary operator right associates, and has higher precedence.  Use parentheses to override the default associations.  Some feedback we've received indicates a desire for intersection to have higher precedence than union.  This is something that feedback from the field may cause us to change in future releases; you may want to parenthesize copiously to avoid such changes affecting your code, until this feature is no longer considered experimental.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The main restriction is that everything is a metacharacter.  Thus, you cannot refer to single characters by doing something like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /(?[ a + b ])/ # Syntax error!<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The easiest way to specify an individual typable character is to enclose it in brackets:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /(?[ [a] + [b] ])/<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(This is the same thing as &quot;[ab]&quot;.)  You could also have said the equivalent:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /(?[[ a b ]])/<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(You can, of course, specify single characters by using, &quot;\x{...}&quot;, &quot;\N{...}&quot;, etc.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
This last example shows the use of this construct to specify an ordinary bracketed character class without additional set operations.  Note the white space within it; &quot;/x&quot; is turned on even within bracketed character classes, except you can't have comments inside them.  Hence,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 (?[ [#] ])<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
matches the literal character &quot;#&quot;.  To specify a literal white space character, you can escape it with a backslash, like:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /(?[ [ a e i o u \  ] ])/<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This matches the English vowels plus the SPACE character. All the other escapes accepted by normal bracketed character classes are accepted here as well; but unrecognized escapes that generate warnings in normal classes are fatal errors here.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All warnings from these class elements are fatal, as well as some practices that don't currently warn.  For example you cannot say<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /(?[ [ \xF ] ])/     # Syntax error!<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You have to have two hex digits after a braceless &quot;\x&quot; (use a leading zero to make two).  These restrictions are to lower the incidence of typos causing the class to not match what you thought it would.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a regular bracketed character class contains a &quot;\p{}&quot; or &quot;\P{}&quot; and is matched against a non-Unicode code point, a warning may be raised, as the result is not Unicode-defined.  No such warning will come when using this extended form.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The final difference between regular bracketed character classes and these, is that it is not possible to get these to match a multi-character fold.  Thus,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /(?[ [\xDF] ])/iu<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
does not match the string &quot;ss&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You don't have to enclose POSIX class names inside double brackets, hence both of the following work:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /(?[ [:word:] - [:lower:] ])/<br/>
 /(?[ [[:word:]] - [[:lower:]] ])/<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any contained POSIX character classes, including things like &quot;\w&quot; and &quot;\D&quot; respect the &quot;/a&quot; (and &quot;/aa&quot;) modifiers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;(?[ ])&quot; is a regex-compile-time construct.  Any attempt to use something which isn't knowable at the time the containing regular expression is compiled is a fatal error.  In practice, this means just three limitations:<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>
<dd>
This construct cannot be used within the scope of &quot;use locale&quot; (or the &quot;/l&quot; regex modifier).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2.</dt>
<dd>
Any user-defined property used must be already defined by the time the regular expression is compiled (but note that this construct can be used instead of such properties).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
3.</dt>
<dd>
A regular expression that otherwise would compile using &quot;/d&quot; rules, and which uses this construct will instead use &quot;/u&quot;.  Thus this construct tells Perl that you don't want &quot;/d&quot; rules for the entire regular expression containing it.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;/x&quot; processing within this class is an extended form. Besides the characters that are considered white space in normal &quot;/x&quot; processing, there are 5 others, recommended by the Unicode standard:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 U+0085 NEXT LINE<br/>
 U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK<br/>
 U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK<br/>
 U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR<br/>
 U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that skipping white space applies only to the interior of this construct.  There must not be any space between any of the characters that form the initial &quot;(?[&quot;.  Nor may there be space between the closing &quot;])&quot; characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Just as in all regular expressions, the pattern can be built up by including variables that are interpolated at regex compilation time. Care must be taken to ensure that you are getting what you expect.  For example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 my $thai_or_lao = '\p{Thai} + \p{Lao}';<br/>
 ...<br/>
 qr/(?[ \p{Digit} &amp; $thai_or_lao ])/;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
compiles to<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 qr/(?[ \p{Digit} &amp; \p{Thai} + \p{Lao} ])/;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
But this does not have the effect that someone reading the code would likely expect, as the intersection applies just to &quot;\p{Thai}&quot;, excluding the Laotian.  Pitfalls like this can be avoided by parenthesizing the component pieces:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 my $thai_or_lao = '( \p{Thai} + \p{Lao} )';<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
But any modifiers will still apply to all the components:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 my $lower = '\p{Lower} + \p{Digit}';<br/>
 qr/(?[ \p{Greek} &amp; $lower ])/i;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
matches upper case things.  You can avoid surprises by making the components into instances of this construct by compiling them:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 my $thai_or_lao = qr/(?[ \p{Thai} + \p{Lao} ])/;<br/>
 my $lower = qr/(?[ \p{Lower} + \p{Digit} ])/;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When these are embedded in another pattern, what they match does not change, regardless of parenthesization or what modifiers are in effect in that outer pattern.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Due to the way that Perl parses things, your parentheses and brackets may need to be balanced, even including comments.  If you run into any examples, please send them to &quot;perlbug@perl.org&quot;, so that we can have a concrete example for this man page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
We may change it so that things that remain legal uses in normal bracketed character classes might become illegal within this experimental construct.  One proposal, for example, is to forbid adjacent uses of the same character, as in &quot;(?[ [aa] ])&quot;.  The motivation for such a change is that this usage is likely a typo, as the second &quot;a&quot; adds nothing.</div>
