An optimization to avoid problems with COW and deliberately overallocated PVs has been disabled because it interfered with another, more important, optimization, causing a slowdown on some platforms. [perl #121975] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121975&gt;</dd>

External libraries and Perl may have different ideas of what the locale is. This is problematic when parsing version strings if the locale's numeric separator has been changed.  Version parsing has been patched to ensure it handles the locales correctly. [perl #121930] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121930&gt;</dd>

<h1>Internal Changes</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Added &quot;sync_locale&quot; in perlapi. Changing the program's locale should be avoided by XS code.  Nevertheless, certain non-Perl libraries called from XS, such as &quot;Gtk&quot; do so.  When this happens, Perl needs to be told that the locale has changed.  Use this function to do so, before returning to Perl.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Selected Bug Fixes</h1><dl>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A bug has been fixed where zero-length assertions and code blocks inside of a regex could cause &quot;pos&quot; to see an incorrect value. [perl #122460] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122460&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Using &quot;s///e&quot; on tainted utf8 strings could issue bogus &quot;Malformed UTF-8 character (unexpected end of string)&quot; warnings.  This has now been fixed. [perl #122148] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122148&gt;</dd>

<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;system&quot; and friends should now work properly on more Android builds.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Due to an oversight, the value specified through <b>-Dtargetsh</b> to <i>Configure</i> would end up being ignored by some of the build process.  This caused perls cross-compiled for Android to end up with defective versions of &quot;system&quot;, &quot;exec&quot; and backticks: the commands would end up looking for  <i>/bin/sh</i> instead of  <i>/system/bin/sh</i>, and so would fail for the vast majority of devices, leaving $! as &quot;ENOENT&quot;.</dd>

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.<div class="spacer">

<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</div>
