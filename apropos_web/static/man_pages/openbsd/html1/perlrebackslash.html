<h1>NAME</h1> perlrebackslash - Perl Regular Expression Backslash Sequences and Escapes</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The top level documentation about Perl regular expressions is found in perlre.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This document describes all backslash and escape sequences. After explaining the role of the backslash, it lists all the sequences that have a special meaning in Perl regular expressions (in alphabetical order), then describes each of them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Most sequences are described in detail in different documents; the primary purpose of this document is to have a quick reference guide describing all backslash and escape sequences.<div class="subsection">
<h2>The backslash</h2> In a regular expression, the backslash can perform one of two tasks: it either takes away the special meaning of the character following it (for instance, &quot;\|&quot; matches a vertical bar, it's not an alternation), or it is the start of a backslash or escape sequence.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The rules determining what it is are quite simple: if the character following the backslash is an ASCII punctuation (non-word) character (that is, anything that is not a letter, digit, or underscore), then the backslash just takes away any special meaning of the character following it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the character following the backslash is an ASCII letter or an ASCII digit, then the sequence may be special; if so, it's listed below. A few letters have not been used yet, so escaping them with a backslash doesn't change them to be special.  A future version of Perl may assign a special meaning to them, so if you have warnings turned on, Perl issues a warning if you use such a sequence.  [1].<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is however guaranteed that backslash or escape sequences never have a punctuation character following the backslash, not now, and not in a future version of Perl 5. So it is safe to put a backslash in front of a non-word character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that the backslash itself is special; if you want to match a backslash, you have to escape the backslash with a backslash: &quot;/\\/&quot; matches a single backslash.<dl>
<dt>
[1]</dt>
<dd>
There is one exception. If you use an alphanumeric character as the delimiter of your pattern (which you probably shouldn't do for readability reasons), you have to escape the delimiter if you want to match it. Perl won't warn then. See also &quot;Gory details of parsing quoted constructs&quot; in perlop.</dd>

Example<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 $str =~ /\t/;   # Matches if $str contains a (horizontal) tab.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Control characters</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\c&quot; is used to denote a control character; the character following &quot;\c&quot; determines the value of the construct.  For example the value of &quot;\cA&quot; is chr(1), and the value of &quot;\cb&quot; is chr(2), etc. The gory details are in &quot;Regexp Quote-Like Operators&quot; in perlop.  A complete list of what chr(1), etc. means for ASCII and EBCDIC platforms is in &quot;OPERATOR DIFFERENCES&quot; in perlebcdic.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that &quot;\c\&quot; alone at the end of a regular expression (or doubled-quoted string) is not valid.  The backslash must be followed by another character. That is, &quot;\c\ <i>X</i>&quot; means &quot;chr(28) . '<i>X</i>'&quot; for all characters <i>X</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To write platform-independent code, you must use &quot;\N{<i>NAME</i>}&quot; instead, like &quot;\N{ESCAPE}&quot; or &quot;\N{U+001B}&quot;, see charnames.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Mnemonic: <i>c</i>ontrol character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Example<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 $str =~ /\cK/;  # Matches if $str contains a vertical tab (control-K).<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Named or numbered characters and character sequences</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Unicode characters have a Unicode name and numeric code point (ordinal) value.  Use the &quot;\N{}&quot; construct to specify a character by either of these values. Certain sequences of characters also have names.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To specify by name, the name of the character or character sequence goes between the curly braces.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To specify a character by Unicode code point, use the form &quot;\N{U+<i>code</i>  <i>point</i>}&quot;, where <i>code point</i> is a number in hexadecimal that gives the code point that Unicode has assigned to the desired character.  It is customary but not required to use leading zeros to pad the number to 4 digits.  Thus &quot;\N{U+0041}&quot; means &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A&quot;, and you will rarely see it written without the two leading zeros.  &quot;\N{U+0041}&quot; means &quot;A&quot; even on EBCDIC machines (where the ordinal value of &quot;A&quot; is not 0x41).<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is even possible to give your own names to characters and character sequences.  For details, see charnames.<div class="spacer">
</div>
(There is an expanded internal form that you may see in debug output: &quot;\N{U+ <i>code point</i>.<i>code point</i>...}&quot;. The &quot;...&quot; means any number of these  <i>code point</i>s separated by dots. This represents the sequence formed by the characters.  This is an internal form only, subject to change, and you should not try to use it yourself.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Mnemonic: <i>N</i>amed character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that a character or character sequence expressed as a named or numbered character is considered a character without special meaning by the regex engine, and will match &quot;as is&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Example<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 $str =~ /\N{THAI CHARACTER SO SO}/;  # Matches the Thai SO SO character<br/>
<br/>
 use charnames 'Cyrillic';            # Loads Cyrillic names.<br/>
 $str =~ /\N{ZHE}\N{KA}/;             # Match &quot;ZHE&quot; followed by &quot;KA&quot;.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Octal escapes</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
There are two forms of octal escapes.  Each is used to specify a character by its code point specified in octal notation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
One form, available starting in Perl 5.14 looks like &quot;\o{...}&quot;, where the dots represent one or more octal digits.  It can be used for any Unicode character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It was introduced to avoid the potential problems with the other form, available in all Perls.  That form consists of a backslash followed by three octal digits.  One problem with this form is that it can look exactly like an old-style backreference (see &quot;Disambiguation rules between old-style octal escapes and backreferences&quot; below.)  You can avoid this by making the first of the three digits always a zero, but that makes \077 the largest code point specifiable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In some contexts, a backslash followed by two or even one octal digits may be interpreted as an octal escape, sometimes with a warning, and because of some bugs, sometimes with surprising results.  Also, if you are creating a regex out of smaller snippets concatenated together, and you use fewer than three digits, the beginning of one snippet may be interpreted as adding digits to the ending of the snippet before it.  See &quot;Absolute referencing&quot; for more discussion and examples of the snippet problem.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that a character expressed as an octal escape is considered a character without special meaning by the regex engine, and will match &quot;as is&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To summarize, the &quot;\o{}&quot; form is always safe to use, and the other form is safe to use for code points through \077 when you use exactly three digits to specify them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Mnemonic: <i>0</i>ctal or <i>o</i>ctal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples (assuming an ASCII platform)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 $str = &quot;Perl&quot;;<br/>
 $str =~ /\o{120}/;  # Match, &quot;\120&quot; is &quot;P&quot;.<br/>
 $str =~ /\120/;     # Same.<br/>
 $str =~ /\o{120}+/; # Match, &quot;\120&quot; is &quot;P&quot;,<br/>
                     # it's repeated at least once.<br/>
 $str =~ /\120+/;    # Same.<br/>
 $str =~ /P\053/;    # No match, &quot;\053&quot; is &quot;+&quot; and taken literally.<br/>
 /\o{23073}/         # Black foreground, white background smiling face.<br/>
 /\o{4801234567}/    # Raises a warning, and yields chr(4).<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Disambiguation rules between old-style octal escapes and backreferences<div class="spacer">
</div>
Octal escapes of the &quot;\000&quot; form outside of bracketed character classes potentially clash with old-style backreferences (see &quot;Absolute referencing&quot; below).  They both consist of a backslash followed by numbers.  So Perl has to use heuristics to determine whether it is a backreference or an octal escape. Perl uses the following rules to disambiguate:<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>
<dd>
If the backslash is followed by a single digit, it's a backreference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2.</dt>
<dd>
If the first digit following the backslash is a 0, it's an octal escape.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
3.</dt>
<dd>
If the number following the backslash is N (in decimal), and Perl already has seen N capture groups, Perl considers this a backreference.  Otherwise, it considers it an octal escape. If N has more than three digits, Perl takes only the first three for the octal escape; the rest are matched as is.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 my $pat  = &quot;(&quot; x 999;<br/>
    $pat .= &quot;a&quot;;<br/>
    $pat .= &quot;)&quot; x 999;<br/>
 /^($pat)\1000$/;   #  Matches 'aa'; there are 1000 capture groups.<br/>
 /^$pat\1000$/;     #  Matches 'a@0'; there are 999 capture groups<br/>
                    #  and \1000 is seen as \100 (a '@') and a '0'.<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can force a backreference interpretation always by using the &quot;\g{...}&quot; form.  You can the force an octal interpretation always by using the &quot;\o{...}&quot; form, or for numbers up through \077 (= 63 decimal), by using three digits, beginning with a &quot;0&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Hexadecimal escapes</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Like octal escapes, there are two forms of hexadecimal escapes, but both start with the same thing, &quot;\x&quot;.  This is followed by either exactly two hexadecimal digits forming a number, or a hexadecimal number of arbitrary length surrounded by curly braces. The hexadecimal number is the code point of the character you want to express.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that a character expressed as one of these escapes is considered a character without special meaning by the regex engine, and will match &quot;as is&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Mnemonic: he<i>x</i>adecimal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples (assuming an ASCII platform)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 $str = &quot;Perl&quot;;<br/>
 $str =~ /\x50/;    # Match, &quot;\x50&quot; is &quot;P&quot;.<br/>
 $str =~ /\x50+/;   # Match, &quot;\x50&quot; is &quot;P&quot;, it is repeated at least once<br/>
 $str =~ /P\x2B/;   # No match, &quot;\x2B&quot; is &quot;+&quot; and taken literally.<br/>
<br/>
 /\x{2603}\x{2602}/ # Snowman with an umbrella.<br/>
                    # The Unicode character 2603 is a snowman,<br/>
                    # the Unicode character 2602 is an umbrella.<br/>
 /\x{263B}/         # Black smiling face.<br/>
 /\x{263b}/         # Same, the hex digits A - F are case insensitive.<br/>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Modifiers</h2> A number of backslash sequences have to do with changing the character, or characters following them. &quot;\l&quot; will lowercase the character following it, while &quot;\u&quot; will uppercase (or, more accurately, titlecase) the character following it. They provide functionality similar to the functions &quot;lcfirst&quot; and &quot;ucfirst&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To uppercase or lowercase several characters, one might want to use &quot;\L&quot; or &quot;\U&quot;, which will lowercase/uppercase all characters following them, until either the end of the pattern or the next occurrence of &quot;\E&quot;, whichever comes first. They provide functionality similar to what the functions &quot;lc&quot; and &quot;uc&quot; provide.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\Q&quot; is used to quote (disable) pattern metacharacters, up to the next &quot;\E&quot; or the end of the pattern. &quot;\Q&quot; adds a backslash to any character that could have special meaning to Perl.  In the ASCII range, it quotes every character that isn't a letter, digit, or underscore.  See &quot;quotemeta&quot; in perlfunc for details on what gets quoted for non-ASCII code points.  Using this ensures that any character between &quot;\Q&quot; and &quot;\E&quot; will be matched literally, not interpreted as a metacharacter by the regex engine.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\F&quot; can be used to casefold all characters following, up to the next &quot;\E&quot; or the end of the pattern. It provides the functionality similar to the &quot;fc&quot; function.<div class="spacer">

<h2>Character classes</h2> Perl regular expressions have a large range of character classes. Some of the character classes are written as a backslash sequence. We will briefly discuss those here; full details of character classes can be found in perlrecharclass.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\w&quot; is a character class that matches any single <i>word</i> character (letters, digits, Unicode marks, and connector punctuation (like the underscore)).  &quot;\d&quot; is a character class that matches any decimal digit, while the character class &quot;\s&quot; matches any whitespace character. New in perl 5.10.0 are the classes &quot;\h&quot; and &quot;\v&quot; which match horizontal and vertical whitespace characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The exact set of characters matched by &quot;\d&quot;, &quot;\s&quot;, and &quot;\w&quot; varies depending on various pragma and regular expression modifiers.  It is possible to restrict the match to the ASCII range by using the &quot;/a&quot; regular expression modifier.  See perlrecharclass.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The uppercase variants (&quot;\W&quot;, &quot;\D&quot;, &quot;\S&quot;, &quot;\H&quot;, and &quot;\V&quot;) are character classes that match, respectively, any character that isn't a word character, digit, whitespace, horizontal whitespace, or vertical whitespace.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Mnemonics: <i>w</i>ord, <i>d</i>igit, <i>s</i>pace, <i>h</i>orizontal, <i>v</i>ertical.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Unicode classes</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\pP&quot; (where &quot;P&quot; is a single letter) and &quot;\p{Property}&quot; are used to match a character that matches the given Unicode property; properties include things like &quot;letter&quot;, or &quot;thai character&quot;. Capitalizing the sequence to &quot;\PP&quot; and &quot;\P{Property}&quot; make the sequence match a character that doesn't match the given Unicode property. For more details, see &quot;Backslash sequences&quot; in perlrecharclass and &quot;Unicode Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode.<div class="spacer">

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Referencing</h2> If capturing parenthesis are used in a regular expression, we can refer to the part of the source string that was matched, and match exactly the same thing. There are three ways of referring to such  <i>backreference</i>: absolutely, relatively, and by name.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Absolute referencing</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Either &quot;\g<i>N</i>&quot; (starting in Perl 5.10.0), or &quot;\<i>N</i>&quot; (old-style) where <i>N</i> is a positive (unsigned) decimal number of any length is an absolute reference to a capturing group.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>N</i> refers to the Nth set of parentheses, so &quot;\g<i>N</i>&quot; refers to whatever has been matched by that set of parentheses.  Thus &quot;\g1&quot; refers to the first capture group in the regex.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;\g<i>N</i>&quot; form can be equivalently written as &quot;\g{<i>N</i>}&quot; which avoids ambiguity when building a regex by concatenating shorter strings.  Otherwise if you had a regex &quot;qr/$a$b/&quot;, and $a contained &quot;\g1&quot;, and $b contained &quot;37&quot;, you would get &quot;/\g137/&quot; which is probably not what you intended.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the &quot;\<i>N</i>&quot; form, <i>N</i> must not begin with a &quot;0&quot;, and there must be at least  <i>N</i> capturing groups, or else <i>N</i> is considered an octal escape (but something like &quot;\18&quot; is the same as &quot;\0018&quot;; that is, the octal escape &quot;\001&quot; followed by a literal digit &quot;8&quot;).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Mnemonic: <i>g</i>roup.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /(\w+) \g1/;    # Finds a duplicated word, (e.g. &quot;cat cat&quot;).<br/>
 /(\w+) \1/;     # Same thing; written old-style.<br/>
 /(.)(.)\g2\g1/;  # Match a four letter palindrome (e.g. &quot;ABBA&quot;).<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Relative referencing</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\g-<i>N</i>&quot; (starting in Perl 5.10.0) is used for relative addressing.  (It can be written as &quot;\g{- <i>N</i>&quot;.)  It refers to the <i>N</i>th group before the &quot;\g{- <i>N</i>}&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The big advantage of this form is that it makes it much easier to write patterns with references that can be interpolated in larger patterns, even if the larger pattern also contains capture groups.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /(A)        # Group 1<br/>
  (          # Group 2<br/>
    (B)      # Group 3<br/>
    \g{-1}   # Refers to group 3 (B)<br/>
    \g{-3}   # Refers to group 1 (A)<br/>
  )<br/>
 /x;         # Matches &quot;ABBA&quot;.<br/>

<i>Named referencing</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\g{<i>name</i>}&quot; (starting in Perl 5.10.0) can be used to back refer to a named capture group, dispensing completely with having to think about capture buffer positions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To be compatible with .Net regular expressions, &quot;\g{name}&quot; may also be written as &quot;\k{name}&quot;, &quot;\k&lt;name&gt;&quot; or &quot;\k'name'&quot;.<div class="spacer">

To prevent any ambiguity, <i>name</i> must not start with a digit nor contain a hyphen.<div class="spacer">

<h2>Assertions</h2> Assertions are conditions that have to be true; they don't actually match parts of the substring. There are six assertions that are written as backslash sequences.<dl>
<dt>
\A</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\A&quot; only matches at the beginning of the string. If the &quot;/m&quot; modifier isn't used, then &quot;/\A/&quot; is equivalent to &quot;/^/&quot;. However, if the &quot;/m&quot; modifier is used, then &quot;/^/&quot; matches internal newlines, but the meaning of &quot;/\A/&quot; isn't changed by the &quot;/m&quot; modifier. &quot;\A&quot; matches at the beginning of the string regardless whether the &quot;/m&quot; modifier is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
\z, \Z</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\z&quot; and &quot;\Z&quot; match at the end of the string. If the &quot;/m&quot; modifier isn't used, then &quot;/\Z/&quot; is equivalent to &quot;/$/&quot;; that is, it matches at the end of the string, or one before the newline at the end of the string. If the &quot;/m&quot; modifier is used, then &quot;/$/&quot; matches at internal newlines, but the meaning of &quot;/\Z/&quot; isn't changed by the &quot;/m&quot; modifier. &quot;\Z&quot; matches at the end of the string (or just before a trailing newline) regardless whether the &quot;/m&quot; modifier is used.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;\z&quot; is just like &quot;\Z&quot;, except that it does not match before a trailing newline. &quot;\z&quot; matches at the end of the string only, regardless of the modifiers used, and not just before a newline.  It is how to anchor the match to the true end of the string under all conditions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
\G</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\G&quot; is usually used only in combination with the &quot;/g&quot; modifier. If the &quot;/g&quot; modifier is used and the match is done in scalar context, Perl remembers where in the source string the last match ended, and the next time, it will start the match from where it ended the previous time.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;\G&quot; matches the point where the previous match on that string ended, or the beginning of that string if there was no previous match.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>

<dt>
\b, \B</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\b&quot; matches at any place between a word and a non-word character; &quot;\B&quot; matches at any place between characters where &quot;\b&quot; doesn't match. &quot;\b&quot; and &quot;\B&quot; assume there's a non-word character before the beginning and after the end of the source string; so &quot;\b&quot; will match at the beginning (or end) of the source string if the source string begins (or ends) with a word character. Otherwise, &quot;\B&quot; will match.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Do not use something like &quot;\b=head\d\b&quot; and expect it to match the beginning of a line.  It can't, because for there to be a boundary before the non-word &quot;=&quot;, there must be a word character immediately previous. All boundary determinations look for word characters alone, not for non-words characters nor for string ends.  It may help to understand how &lt;\b&gt; and &lt;\B&gt; work by equating them as follows:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    \b  really means    (?:(?&lt;=\w)(?!\w)|(?&lt;!\w)(?=\w))<br/>
    \B  really means    (?:(?&lt;=\w)(?=\w)|(?&lt;!\w)(?!\w))<br/>

<h2>Misc</h2> Here we document the backslash sequences that don't fall in one of the categories above. These are:<dl>
<dt>
\C</dt>
<dd>
(Deprecated.) &quot;\C&quot; always matches a single octet, even if the source string is encoded in UTF-8 format, and the character to be matched is a multi-octet character. This is very dangerous, because it violates the logical character abstraction and can cause UTF-8 sequences to become malformed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use &quot;utf8::encode()&quot; instead.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Mnemonic: o<i>C</i>tet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
\K</dt>
<dd>
This appeared in perl 5.10.0. Anything matched left of &quot;\K&quot; is not included in $&amp;, and will not be replaced if the pattern is used in a substitution. This lets you write &quot;s/PAT1 \K PAT2/REPL/x&quot; instead of &quot;s/(PAT1) PAT2/${1}REPL/x&quot; or &quot;s/(?&lt;=PAT1) PAT2/REPL/x&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: <i>K</i>eep.</dd>
</dl>

\N</dt>
<dd>
This feature, available starting in v5.12,  matches any character that is  <b>not</b> a newline.  It is a short-hand for writing &quot;[^\n]&quot;, and is identical to the &quot;.&quot; metasymbol, except under the &quot;/s&quot; flag, which changes the meaning of &quot;.&quot;, but not &quot;\N&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that &quot;\N{...}&quot; can mean a named or numbered character .<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: Complement of <i>\n</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
\R</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\R&quot; matches a <i>generic newline</i>; that is, anything considered a linebreak sequence by Unicode. This includes all characters matched by &quot;\v&quot; (vertical whitespace), and the multi character sequence &quot;\x0D\x0A&quot; (carriage return followed by a line feed, sometimes called the network newline; it's the end of line sequence used in Microsoft text files opened in binary mode). &quot;\R&quot; is equivalent to &quot;(?&gt;\x0D\x0A|\v)&quot;.  (The reason it doesn't backtrack is that the sequence is considered inseparable.  That means that<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 &quot;\x0D\x0A&quot; =~ /^\R\x0A$/   # No match<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
fails, because the &quot;\R&quot; matches the entire string, and won't backtrack to match just the &quot;\x0D&quot;.)  Since &quot;\R&quot; can match a sequence of more than one character, it cannot be put inside a bracketed character class; &quot;/[\R]/&quot; is an error; use &quot;\v&quot; instead.  &quot;\R&quot; was introduced in perl 5.10.0.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that this does not respect any locale that might be in effect; it matches according to the platform's native character set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: none really. &quot;\R&quot; was picked because PCRE already uses &quot;\R&quot;, and more importantly because Unicode recommends such a regular expression metacharacter, and suggests &quot;\R&quot; as its notation.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
\X</dt>
<dd>
This matches a Unicode <i>extended grapheme cluster</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;\X&quot; matches quite well what normal (non-Unicode-programmer) usage would consider a single character.  As an example, consider a G with some sort of diacritic mark, such as an arrow.  There is no such single character in Unicode, but one can be composed by using a G followed by a Unicode &quot;COMBINING UPWARDS ARROW BELOW&quot;, and would be displayed by Unicode-aware software as if it were a single character.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The match is greedy and non-backtracking, so that the cluster is never broken up into smaller components.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
