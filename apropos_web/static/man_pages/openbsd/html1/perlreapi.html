<h1>NAME</h1> perlreapi - Perl regular expression plugin interface</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> As of Perl 5.9.5 there is a new interface for plugging and using regular expression engines other than the default one.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each engine is supposed to provide access to a constant structure of the following format:<div class="spacer">

<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a regexp is compiled, its &quot;engine&quot; field is then set to point at the appropriate structure, so that when it needs to be used Perl can find the right routines to do so.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In order to install a new regexp handler, $^H{regcomp} is set to an integer which (when casted appropriately) resolves to one of these structures.  When compiling, the &quot;comp&quot; method is executed, and the resulting &quot;regexp&quot; structure's engine field is expected to point back at the same structure.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The pTHX_ symbol in the definition is a macro used by Perl under threading to provide an extra argument to the routine holding a pointer back to the interpreter that is executing the regexp. So under threading all routines get an extra argument.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Callbacks</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>comp</h2><br/>
    REGEXP* comp(pTHX_ const SV * const pattern, const U32 flags);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Compile the pattern stored in &quot;pattern&quot; using the given &quot;flags&quot; and return a pointer to a prepared &quot;REGEXP&quot; structure that can perform the match.  See &quot;The REGEXP structure&quot; below for an explanation of the individual fields in the REGEXP struct.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;pattern&quot; parameter is the scalar that was used as the pattern.  Previous versions of Perl would pass two &quot;char*&quot; indicating the start and end of the stringified pattern; the following snippet can be used to get the old parameters:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    STRLEN plen;<br/>
    char*  exp = SvPV(pattern, plen);<br/>
    char* xend = exp + plen;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since any scalar can be passed as a pattern, it's possible to implement an engine that does something with an array (&quot;&quot;ook&quot; =~ [ qw/ eek hlagh / ]&quot;) or with the non-stringified form of a compiled regular expression (&quot;&quot;ook&quot; =~ qr/eek/&quot;).  Perl's own engine will always stringify everything using the snippet above, but that doesn't mean other engines have to.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;flags&quot; parameter is a bitfield which indicates which of the &quot;msixp&quot; flags the regex was compiled with.  It also contains additional info, such as if &quot;use locale&quot; is in effect.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;eogc&quot; flags are stripped out before being passed to the comp routine.  The regex engine does not need to know if any of these are set, as those flags should only affect what Perl does with the pattern and its match variables, not how it gets compiled and executed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
By the time the comp callback is called, some of these flags have already had effect (noted below where applicable).  However most of their effect occurs after the comp callback has run, in routines that read the &quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot; field which it populates.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In general the flags should be preserved in &quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot; after compilation, although the regex engine might want to add or delete some of them to invoke or disable some special behavior in Perl.  The flags along with any special behavior they cause are documented below:<div class="spacer">
</div>
The pattern modifiers:<dl>
<dt>
&quot;/m&quot; - RXf_PMf_MULTILINE</dt>
<dd>
If this is in &quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot; it will be passed to &quot;Perl_fbm_instr&quot; by &quot;pp_split&quot; which will treat the subject string as a multi-line string.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;/s&quot; - RXf_PMf_SINGLELINE</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;/i&quot; - RXf_PMf_FOLD</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;/x&quot; - RXf_PMf_EXTENDED</dt>
<dd>
If present on a regex, &quot;#&quot; comments will be handled differently by the tokenizer in some cases.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
TODO: Document those cases.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;/p&quot; - RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY</dt>
<dd>
TODO: Document this</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Character set</dt>
<dd>
The character set rules are determined by an enum that is contained in this field.  This is still experimental and subject to change, but the current interface returns the rules by use of the in-line function &quot;get_regex_charset(const U32 flags)&quot;.  The only currently documented value returned from it is REGEX_LOCALE_CHARSET, which is set if &quot;use locale&quot; is in effect. If present in &quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot;, &quot;split&quot; will use the locale dependent definition of whitespace when RXf_SKIPWHITE or RXf_WHITE is in effect.  ASCII whitespace is defined as per isSPACE, and by the internal macros &quot;is_utf8_space&quot; under UTF-8, and &quot;isSPACE_LC&quot; under &quot;use locale&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Additional flags:<dl>
<dt>
RXf_SPLIT</dt>
<dd>
This flag was removed in perl 5.18.0.  &quot;split ' '&quot; is now special-cased solely in the parser.  RXf_SPLIT is still #defined, so you can test for it. This is how it used to work:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If &quot;split&quot; is invoked as &quot;split ' '&quot; or with no arguments (which really means &quot;split(' ', $_)&quot;, see split), Perl will set this flag.  The regex engine can then check for it and set the SKIPWHITE and WHITE extflags.  To do this, the Perl engine does:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    if (flags &amp; RXf_SPLIT &amp;&amp; r-&gt;prelen == 1 &amp;&amp; r-&gt;precomp[0] == ' ')<br/>
        r-&gt;extflags |= (RXf_SKIPWHITE|RXf_WHITE);<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
These flags can be set during compilation to enable optimizations in the &quot;split&quot; operator.<dl>
<dt>
RXf_SKIPWHITE</dt>
<dd>
This flag was removed in perl 5.18.0.  It is still #defined, so you can set it, but doing so will have no effect.  This is how it used to work:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the flag is present in &quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot; &quot;split&quot; will delete whitespace from the start of the subject string before it's operated on.  What is considered whitespace depends on if the subject is a UTF-8 string and if the &quot;RXf_PMf_LOCALE&quot; flag is set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If RXf_WHITE is set in addition to this flag, &quot;split&quot; will behave like &quot;split &quot; &quot;&quot; under the Perl engine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
RXf_START_ONLY</dt>
<dd>
Tells the split operator to split the target string on newlines (&quot;\n&quot;) without invoking the regex engine.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl's engine sets this if the pattern is &quot;/^/&quot; (&quot;plen == 1 &amp;&amp; *exp == '^'&quot;), even under &quot;/^/s&quot;; see split.  Of course a different regex engine might want to use the same optimizations with a different syntax.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
RXf_WHITE</dt>
<dd>
Tells the split operator to split the target string on whitespace without invoking the regex engine.  The definition of whitespace varies depending on if the target string is a UTF-8 string and on if RXf_PMf_LOCALE is set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl's engine sets this flag if the pattern is &quot;\s+&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
RXf_NULL</dt>
<dd>
Tells the split operator to split the target string on characters.  The definition of character varies depending on if the target string is a UTF-8 string.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl's engine sets this flag on empty patterns, this optimization makes &quot;split //&quot; much faster than it would otherwise be.  It's even faster than &quot;unpack&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
RXf_NO_INPLACE_SUBST</dt>
<dd>
Added in perl 5.18.0, this flag indicates that a regular expression might perform an operation that would interfere with inplace substitution. For instance it might contain lookbehind, or assign to non-magical variables (such as $REGMARK and $REGERROR) during matching.  &quot;s///&quot; will skip certain optimisations when this is set.</dd>

</div>
Find the start position where a regex match should be attempted, or possibly if the regex engine should not be run because the pattern can't match.  This is called, as appropriate, by the core, depending on the values of the &quot;extflags&quot; member of the &quot;regexp&quot; structure.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Arguments:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    rx:     the regex to match against<br/>
    sv:     the SV being matched: only used for utf8 flag; the string<br/>
            itself is accessed via the pointers below. Note that on<br/>
            something like an overloaded SV, SvPOK(sv) may be false<br/>
            and the string pointers may point to something unrelated to<br/>
            the SV itself.<br/>
    strbeg: real beginning of string<br/>
    strpos: the point in the string at which to begin matching<br/>
    strend: pointer to the byte following the last char of the string<br/>
    flags   currently unused; set to 0<br/>

<h2>checkstr</h2><br/>
    SV* checkstr(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Return a SV containing a string that must appear in the pattern. Used by &quot;split&quot; for optimising matches.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>free</h2><br/>
    void free(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Called by Perl when it is freeing a regexp pattern so that the engine can release any resources pointed to by the &quot;pprivate&quot; member of the &quot;regexp&quot; structure.  This is only responsible for freeing private data; Perl will handle releasing anything else contained in the &quot;regexp&quot; structure.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Numbered capture callbacks</h2> Called to get/set the value of &quot;$`&quot;, &quot;$'&quot;, $&amp; and their named equivalents, ${^PREMATCH}, ${^POSTMATCH} and ${^MATCH}, as well as the numbered capture groups ($1, $2, ...).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;paren&quot; parameter will be 1 for $1, 2 for $2 and so forth, and have these symbolic values for the special variables:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    ${^PREMATCH}  RX_BUFF_IDX_CARET_PREMATCH<br/>
    ${^POSTMATCH} RX_BUFF_IDX_CARET_POSTMATCH<br/>

    $&amp;            RX_BUFF_IDX_FULLMATCH<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that in Perl 5.17.3 and earlier, the last three constants were also used for the caret variants of the variables.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The names have been chosen by analogy with Tie::Scalar methods names with an additional  <b>LENGTH</b> callback for efficiency.  However named capture variables are currently not tied internally but implemented via magic.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>numbered_buff_FETCH</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    void numbered_buff_FETCH(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const I32 paren,<br/>
                             SV * const sv);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Fetch a specified numbered capture.  &quot;sv&quot; should be set to the scalar to return, the scalar is passed as an argument rather than being returned from the function because when it's called Perl already has a scalar to store the value, creating another one would be redundant.  The scalar can be set with &quot;sv_setsv&quot;, &quot;sv_setpvn&quot; and friends, see perlapi.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This callback is where Perl untaints its own capture variables under taint mode (see perlsec).  See the &quot;Perl_reg_numbered_buff_fetch&quot; function in  <i>regcomp.c</i> for how to untaint capture variables if that's something you'd like your engine to do as well.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>numbered_buff_STORE</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    void    (*numbered_buff_STORE) (pTHX_<br/>
                                    REGEXP * const rx,<br/>
                                    const I32 paren,<br/>
                                    SV const * const value);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Set the value of a numbered capture variable.  &quot;value&quot; is the scalar that is to be used as the new value.  It's up to the engine to make sure this is used as the new value (or reject it).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    if (&quot;ook&quot; =~ /(o*)/) {<br/>
        # 'paren' will be '1' and 'value' will be 'ee'<br/>
        $1 =~ tr/o/e/;<br/>
    }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl's own engine will croak on any attempt to modify the capture variables, to do this in another engine use the following callback (copied from &quot;Perl_reg_numbered_buff_store&quot;):<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    void<br/>
    Example_reg_numbered_buff_store(pTHX_<br/>
                                    REGEXP * const rx,<br/>
                                    const I32 paren,<br/>
                                    SV const * const value)<br/>
    {<br/>
        PERL_UNUSED_ARG(rx);<br/>
        PERL_UNUSED_ARG(paren);<br/>
        PERL_UNUSED_ARG(value);<br/>
<br/>
        if (!PL_localizing)<br/>
            Perl_croak(aTHX_ PL_no_modify);<br/>
    }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Actually Perl will not <i>always</i> croak in a statement that looks like it would modify a numbered capture variable.  This is because the STORE callback will not be called if Perl can determine that it doesn't have to modify the value.  This is exactly how tied variables behave in the same situation:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    package CaptureVar;<br/>
    use parent 'Tie::Scalar';<br/>
<br/>
    sub TIESCALAR { bless [] }<br/>
    sub FETCH { undef }<br/>
    sub STORE { die &quot;This doesn't get called&quot; }<br/>
<br/>
    package main;<br/>
<br/>
    tie my $sv =&gt; &quot;CaptureVar&quot;;<br/>
    $sv =~ y/a/b/;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Because $sv is &quot;undef&quot; when the &quot;y///&quot; operator is applied to it, the transliteration won't actually execute and the program won't &quot;die&quot;.  This is different to how 5.8 and earlier versions behaved since the capture variables were READONLY variables then; now they'll just die when assigned to in the default engine.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>numbered_buff_LENGTH</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    I32 numbered_buff_LENGTH (pTHX_<br/>
                              REGEXP * const rx,<br/>
                              const SV * const sv,<br/>
                              const I32 paren);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Get the &quot;length&quot; of a capture variable.  There's a special callback for this so that Perl doesn't have to do a FETCH and run &quot;length&quot; on the result, since the length is (in Perl's case) known from an offset stored in &quot;rx-&gt;offs&quot;, this is much more efficient:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    I32 s1  = rx-&gt;offs[paren].start;<br/>
    I32 s2  = rx-&gt;offs[paren].end;<br/>
    I32 len = t1 - s1;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is a little bit more complex in the case of UTF-8, see what &quot;Perl_reg_numbered_buff_length&quot; does with is_utf8_string_loclen.</div>

There are two callbacks, &quot;named_buff&quot; is called in all the cases the FETCH, STORE, DELETE, CLEAR, EXISTS and SCALAR Tie::Hash callbacks would be on changes to &quot;%+&quot; and &quot;%-&quot; and &quot;named_buff_iter&quot; in the same cases as FIRSTKEY and NEXTKEY.<div class="spacer">

The &quot;flags&quot; parameter can be used to determine which of these operations the callbacks should respond to.  The following flags are currently defined:<div class="spacer">

Internally &quot;%+&quot; and &quot;%-&quot; are implemented with a real tied interface via Tie::Hash::NamedCapture.  The methods in that package will call back into these functions.  However the usage of Tie::Hash::NamedCapture for this purpose might change in future releases.  For instance this might be implemented by magic instead (would need an extension to mgvtbl).<div class="spacer">

On threaded builds a regexp may need to be duplicated so that the pattern can be used by multiple threads.  This routine is expected to handle the duplication of any private data pointed to by the &quot;pprivate&quot; member of the &quot;regexp&quot; structure.  It will be called with the preconstructed new &quot;regexp&quot; structure as an argument, the &quot;pprivate&quot; member will point at the  <b>old</b> private structure, and it is this routine's responsibility to construct a copy and return a pointer to it (which Perl will then use to overwrite the field as passed to this routine.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
This allows the engine to dupe its private data but also if necessary modify the final structure if it really must.<div class="spacer">

On unthreaded builds this field doesn't exist.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>The REGEXP structure</h1> The REGEXP struct is defined in  <i>regexp.h</i>. All regex engines must be able to correctly build such a structure in their &quot;comp&quot; routine.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The REGEXP structure contains all the data that Perl needs to be aware of to properly work with the regular expression.  It includes data about optimisations that Perl can use to determine if the regex engine should really be used, and various other control info that is needed to properly execute patterns in various contexts, such as if the pattern anchored in some way, or what flags were used during the compile, or if the program contains special constructs that Perl needs to be aware of.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In addition it contains two fields that are intended for the private use of the regex engine that compiled the pattern.  These are the &quot;intflags&quot; and &quot;pprivate&quot; members.  &quot;pprivate&quot; is a void pointer to an arbitrary structure, whose use and management is the responsibility of the compiling engine.  Perl will never modify either of these values.<div class="spacer">

</div>
The fields are discussed in more detail below:<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;engine&quot;</h2> This field points at a &quot;regexp_engine&quot; structure which contains pointers to the subroutines that are to be used for performing a match.  It is the compiling routine's responsibility to populate this field before returning the regexp object.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Internally this is set to &quot;NULL&quot; unless a custom engine is specified in $^H{regcomp}, Perl's own set of callbacks can be accessed in the struct pointed to by &quot;RE_ENGINE_PTR&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;mother_re&quot;</h2> TODO, see &lt;http://www.mail-archive.com/perl5-changes@perl.org/msg17328.html&gt;</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;extflags&quot;</h2> This will be used by Perl to see what flags the regexp was compiled with, this will normally be set to the value of the flags parameter by the comp callback.  See the comp documentation for valid flags.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;minlen&quot; &quot;minlenret&quot;</h2> The minimum string length (in characters) required for the pattern to match. This is used to prune the search space by not bothering to match any closer to the end of a string than would allow a match.  For instance there is no point in even starting the regex engine if the minlen is 10 but the string is only 5 characters long.  There is no way that the pattern can match.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;minlenret&quot; is the minimum length (in characters) of the string that would be found in $&amp; after a match.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The difference between &quot;minlen&quot; and &quot;minlenret&quot; can be seen in the following pattern:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    /ns(?=\d)/<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
where the &quot;minlen&quot; would be 3 but &quot;minlenret&quot; would only be 2 as the \d is required to match but is not actually included in the matched content.  This distinction is particularly important as the substitution logic uses the &quot;minlenret&quot; to tell if it can do in-place substitutions (these can result in considerable speed-up).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;gofs&quot;</h2> Left offset from  <i>pos()</i> to start match at.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;substrs&quot;</h2> Substring data about strings that must appear in the final match.  This is currently only used internally by Perl's engine, but might be used in the future for all engines for optimisations.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;nparens&quot;, &quot;lastparen&quot;, and &quot;lastcloseparen&quot;</h2> These fields are used to keep track of how many paren groups could be matched in the pattern, which was the last open paren to be entered, and which was the last close paren to be entered.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;intflags&quot;</h2> The engine's private copy of the flags the pattern was compiled with. Usually this is the same as &quot;extflags&quot; unless the engine chose to modify one of them.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;pprivate&quot;</h2> A void* pointing to an engine-defined data structure.  The Perl engine uses the &quot;regexp_internal&quot; structure (see &quot;Base Structures&quot; in perlreguts) but a custom engine should use something else.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;swap&quot;</h2> Unused.  Left in for compatibility with Perl 5.10.0.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;offs&quot;</h2> A &quot;regexp_paren_pair&quot; structure which defines offsets into the string being matched which correspond to the $&amp; and $1, $2 etc. captures, the &quot;regexp_paren_pair&quot; struct is defined as follows:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    typedef struct regexp_paren_pair {<br/>
        I32 start;<br/>
        I32 end;<br/>
    } regexp_paren_pair;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If &quot;-&gt;offs[num].start&quot; or &quot;-&gt;offs[num].end&quot; is &quot;-1&quot; then that capture group did not match. &quot;-&gt;offs[0].start/end&quot; represents $&amp; (or &quot;${^MATCH}&quot; under &quot;//p&quot;) and &quot;-&gt;offs[paren].end&quot; matches $$paren where $paren = 1&gt;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;precomp&quot; &quot;prelen&quot;</h2> Used for optimisations.  &quot;precomp&quot; holds a copy of the pattern that was compiled and &quot;prelen&quot; its length.  When a new pattern is to be compiled (such as inside a loop) the internal &quot;regcomp&quot; operator checks if the last compiled &quot;REGEXP&quot;'s &quot;precomp&quot; and &quot;prelen&quot; are equivalent to the new one, and if so uses the old pattern instead of compiling a new one.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The relevant snippet from &quot;Perl_pp_regcomp&quot;:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        if (!re || !re-&gt;precomp || re-&gt;prelen != (I32)len ||<br/>
            memNE(re-&gt;precomp, t, len))<br/>
        /* Compile a new pattern */<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;paren_names&quot;</h2> This is a hash used internally to track named capture groups and their offsets.  The keys are the names of the buffers the values are dualvars, with the IV slot holding the number of buffers with the given name and the pv being an embedded array of I32.  The values may also be contained independently in the data array in cases where named backreferences are used.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;substrs&quot;</h2> Holds information on the longest string that must occur at a fixed offset from the start of the pattern, and the longest string that must occur at a floating offset from the start of the pattern.  Used to do Fast-Boyer-Moore searches on the string to find out if its worth using the regex engine at all, and if so where in the string to search.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;subbeg&quot; &quot;sublen&quot; &quot;saved_copy&quot; &quot;suboffset&quot; &quot;subcoffset&quot;</h2> Used during the execution phase for managing search and replace patterns, and for providing the text for $&amp;, $1 etc. &quot;subbeg&quot; points to a buffer (either the original string, or a copy in the case of &quot;RX_MATCH_COPIED(rx)&quot;), and &quot;sublen&quot; is the length of the buffer.  The &quot;RX_OFFS&quot; start and end indices index into this buffer.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the presence of the &quot;REXEC_COPY_STR&quot; flag, but with the addition of the &quot;REXEC_COPY_SKIP_PRE&quot; or &quot;REXEC_COPY_SKIP_POST&quot; flags, an engine can choose not to copy the full buffer (although it must still do so in the presence of &quot;RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY&quot; or the relevant bits being set in &quot;PL_sawampersand&quot;).  In this case, it may set &quot;suboffset&quot; to indicate the number of bytes from the logical start of the buffer to the physical start (i.e. &quot;subbeg&quot;).  It should also set &quot;subcoffset&quot;, the number of characters in the offset. The latter is needed to support &quot;@-&quot; and &quot;@+&quot; which work in characters, not bytes.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;wrapped&quot; &quot;wraplen&quot;</h2> Stores the string &quot;qr//&quot; stringifies to. The Perl engine for example stores &quot;(?^:eek)&quot; in the case of &quot;qr/eek/&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When using a custom engine that doesn't support the &quot;(?:)&quot; construct for inline modifiers, it's probably best to have &quot;qr//&quot; stringify to the supplied pattern, note that this will create undesired patterns in cases such as:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    my $x = qr/a|b/;  # &quot;a|b&quot;<br/>
    my $y = qr/c/i;   # &quot;c&quot;<br/>
    my $z = qr/$x$y/; # &quot;a|bc&quot;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There's no solution for this problem other than making the custom engine understand a construct like &quot;(?:)&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;seen_evals&quot;</h2> This stores the number of eval groups in the pattern.  This is used for security purposes when embedding compiled regexes into larger patterns with &quot;qr//&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;refcnt&quot;</h2> The number of times the structure is referenced.  When this falls to 0, the regexp is automatically freed by a call to pregfree.  This should be set to 1 in each engine's &quot;comp&quot; routine.</div>
