.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "zaudio0 at pxaip?"
.Cd "audio* at zaudio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the sound hardware found on the Zaurus with the
.Xr audio 4
framework.
Sound support on the Zaurus is provided by the Inter-IC Sound (I2S)
Controller which is used to transfer samples to a Wolfson Microelectronics
WM8750 audio codec.
The WM8750 is controlled via the PXA2x0 I2C Controller.
.Pp
The hardware is capable of using both the internal speaker and headphone
socket for the playback of 8- and 16-bit audio samples at rates
ranging from 8kHz to 48kHz.
