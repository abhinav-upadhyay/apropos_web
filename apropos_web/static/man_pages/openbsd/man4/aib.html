<div class="section">
<h1 id="x4445534352495054494f4e">DESCRIPTION</h1> The <b class="name">aibs</b> driver provides support for the voltage, temperature and fan sensors available through the ATK0110 ACPI device on ASUSTeK motherboards. The number of sensors of each type, as well as the description of each sensor, varies according to the motherboard.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The driver supports an arbitrary set of sensors, provides a description regarding what each sensor is used for, and reports whether each sensor is within the specifications as defined by the motherboard manufacturer through ACPI.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b class="name">aibs</b> driver supports sensor states as follows: temperature sensors can have a state of <span class="define">OK</span>, <span class="define">WARN</span>, <span class="define">CRIT</span> or <span class="define">UNKNOWN</span>; fan and voltage sensors can have a state of <span class="define">OK</span> or <span class="define">WARN</span> only. Temperature sensors that have a reading of 0 are marked as invalid and their state is set to <span class="define">UNKNOWN</span>, whereas all other sensors are always assumed valid. Temperature sensors have two upper limits (<span class="define">WARN</span> and <span class="define">CRIT</span>), fan sensors have either only the lower limit, or one lower and one upper limit, and voltage sensors always have a lower and an upper limit.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Sensor values are made available through the <span class="define">HW_SENSORS</span> <a class="link-man" href="../html3/sysctl.html">sysctl(3)</a> interface, and can be monitored with the <a class="link-man" href="../html1/systat.html">systat(1)</a> <i class="arg">sensors</i> view, <a class="link-man" href="../html8/sensorsd.html">sensorsd(8)</a>, or <a class="link-man" href="../html8/sysctl.html">sysctl(8)</a> <i class="arg">hw.sensors</i>. For example, on an Asus Stricker Extreme motherboard:<div class="spacer">

Generally, sensors provided by the <b class="name">aibs</b> driver may also be supported by a variety of other drivers, such as <a class="link-man" href="../html4/lm.html">lm(4)</a> or <a class="link-man" href="../html4/it.html">it(4)</a>. The precise collection of <b class="name">aibs</b> sensors is comprised of the sensors specifically utilised in the motherboard design, which may be supported through a combination of one or more physical hardware monitoring chips.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b class="name">aibs</b> driver, however, provides the following advantages when compared to the native hardware monitoring drivers:<ul style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;" class="list list-bul">
<li class="list-bul" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Sensor values from <b class="name">aibs</b> are expected to be more reliable. For example, voltage sensors in many hardware monitoring chips can only sense voltage from 0 to 2 or 4 volts, and the excessive voltage is removed by the resistors, which may vary with the motherboard and with the voltage that is being sensed. In <b class="name">aibs</b>, the required resistor factors are provided by the motherboard manufacturer through ACPI; in the native drivers, the resistor factors are encoded into the driver based on the chip manufacturer's recommendations. In essence, sensor values from <b class="name">aibs</b> are very likely to be identical to the readings from the Hardware Monitor screen in the BIOS.</li>
<li class="list-bul" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Sensor descriptions from <b class="name">aibs</b> are more likely to match the markings on the motherboard.</li>
<li class="list-bul" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Sensor status is supported by <b class="name">aibs</b>. The status is reported based on the acceptable range of values for each individual sensor as suggested by the motherboard manufacturer. For example, the threshold for the CPU temperature sensor is likely to be significantly higher than that for the chassis temperature sensor.</li>
<li class="list-bul" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Support for newer chips in <b class="name">aibs</b>. Newer chips may miss a native driver, but should be supported through <b class="name">aibs</b> regardless.</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a result, sensor readings from the actual native hardware monitoring drivers may be ignored as appropriate.</div>
