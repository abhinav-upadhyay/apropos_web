<h1>NAME</h1> perlunitut - Perl Unicode Tutorial</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The days of just flinging strings around are over. It's well established that modern programs need to be capable of communicating funny accented letters, and things like euro symbols. This means that programmers need new habits. It's easy to program Unicode capable software, but it does require discipline to do it right.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There's a lot to know about character sets, and text encodings. It's probably best to spend a full day learning all this, but the basics can be learned in minutes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These are not the very basics, though. It is assumed that you already know the difference between bytes and characters, and realise (and accept!) that there are many different character sets and encodings, and that your program has to be explicit about them. Recommended reading is &quot;The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)&quot; by Joel Spolsky, at &lt;http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html&gt;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This tutorial speaks in rather absolute terms, and provides only a limited view of the wealth of character string related features that Perl has to offer. For most projects, this information will probably suffice.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Definitions</h2> It's important to set a few things straight first. This is the most important part of this tutorial. This view may conflict with other information that you may have found on the web, but that's mostly because many sources are wrong.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may have to re-read this entire section a few times...<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Unicode</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Unicode</b> is a character set with room for lots of characters. The ordinal value of a character is called a  <b>code point</b>.   (But in practice, the distinction between code point and character is blurred, so the terms often are used interchangeably.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are many, many code points, but computers work with bytes, and a byte has room for only 256 values.  Unicode has many more characters than that, so you need a method to make these accessible.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unicode is encoded using several competing encodings, of which UTF-8 is the most used. In a Unicode encoding, multiple subsequent bytes can be used to store a single code point, or simply: character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>UTF-8</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>UTF-8</b> is a Unicode encoding. Many people think that Unicode and UTF-8 are the same thing, but they're not. There are more Unicode encodings, but much of the world has standardized on UTF-8. <div class="spacer">
</div>
UTF-8 treats the first 128 codepoints, 0..127, the same as ASCII. They take only one byte per character. All other characters are encoded as two or more (up to six) bytes using a complex scheme. Fortunately, Perl handles this for us, so we don't have to worry about this.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Text strings (character strings)</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Text strings</b>, or <b>character strings</b> are made of characters. Bytes are irrelevant here, and so are encodings. Each character is just that: the character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On a text string, you would do things like:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $text =~ s/foo/bar/;<br/>
    if ($string =~ /^\d+$/) { ... }<br/>
    $text = ucfirst $text;<br/>
    my $character_count = length $text;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The value of a character (&quot;ord&quot;, &quot;chr&quot;) is the corresponding Unicode code point.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Binary strings (byte strings)</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Binary strings</b>, or <b>byte strings</b> are made of bytes. Here, you don't have characters, just bytes. All communication with the outside world (anything outside of your current Perl process) is done in binary.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On a binary string, you would do things like:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    my (@length_content) = unpack &quot;(V/a)*&quot;, $binary;<br/>
    $binary =~ s/\x00\x0F/\xFF\xF0/;  # for the brave :)<br/>
    print {$fh} $binary;<br/>
    my $byte_count = length $binary;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Encoding</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Encoding</b> (as a verb) is the conversion from <i>text</i> to <i>binary</i>. To encode, you have to supply the target encoding, for example &quot;iso-8859-1&quot; or &quot;UTF-8&quot;. Some encodings, like the &quot;iso-8859&quot; (&quot;latin&quot;) range, do not support the full Unicode standard; characters that can't be represented are lost in the conversion.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Decoding</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Decoding</b> is the conversion from <i>binary</i> to <i>text</i>. To decode, you have to know what encoding was used during the encoding phase. And most of all, it must be something decodable. It doesn't make much sense to decode a PNG image into a text string.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Internal format</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl has an <b>internal format</b>, an encoding that it uses to encode text strings so it can store them in memory. All text strings are in this internal format. In fact, text strings are never in any other format!<div class="spacer">
</div>
You shouldn't worry about what this format is, because conversion is automatically done when you decode or encode.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Your new toolkit</h2> Add to your standard heading the following line:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use Encode qw(encode decode);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Or, if you're lazy, just:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use Encode;<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>I/O flow (the actual 5 minute tutorial)</h2> The typical input/output flow of a program is:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    1. Receive and decode<br/>
    2. Process<br/>
    3. Encode and output<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If your input is binary, and is supposed to remain binary, you shouldn't decode it to a text string, of course. But in all other cases, you should decode it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Decoding can't happen reliably if you don't know how the data was encoded. If you get to choose, it's a good idea to standardize on UTF-8.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    my $foo   = decode('UTF-8', get 'http://example.com/');<br/>
    my $bar   = decode('ISO-8859-1', readline STDIN);<br/>
    my $xyzzy = decode('Windows-1251', $cgi-&gt;param('foo'));<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Processing happens as you knew before. The only difference is that you're now using characters instead of bytes. That's very useful if you use things like &quot;substr&quot;, or &quot;length&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It's important to realize that there are no bytes in a text string. Of course, Perl has its internal encoding to store the string in memory, but ignore that. If you have to do anything with the number of bytes, it's probably best to move that part to step 3, just after you've encoded the string. Then you know exactly how many bytes it will be in the destination string.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The syntax for encoding text strings to binary strings is as simple as decoding:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $body = encode('UTF-8', $body);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you needed to know the length of the string in bytes, now's the perfect time for that. Because $body is now a byte string, &quot;length&quot; will report the number of bytes, instead of the number of characters. The number of characters is no longer known, because characters only exist in text strings.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    my $byte_count = length $body;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And if the protocol you're using supports a way of letting the recipient know which character encoding you used, please help the receiving end by using that feature! For example, E-mail and HTTP support MIME headers, so you can use the &quot;Content-Type&quot; header. They can also have &quot;Content-Length&quot; to indicate the number of  <i>bytes</i>, which is always a good idea to supply if the number is known.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    &quot;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8&quot;,<br/>
    &quot;Content-Length: $byte_count&quot;<br/>
</div>

Thanks to Gerard Goossen from TTY. His presentation &quot;UTF-8 in the wild&quot; (Dutch Perl Workshop 2006) inspired me to publish my thoughts and write this tutorial.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Thanks to the people who asked about this kind of stuff in several Perl IRC channels, and have constantly reminded me that a simpler explanation was needed.<div class="spacer">
