<h1>NAME</h1> perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of desperation):<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    (W) A warning (optional).<br/>
    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).<br/>
    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).<br/>
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).<br/>
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).<br/>
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).<br/>
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The majority of messages from the first three classifications above (W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a message can be controlled by the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma, its warning category is included with the classification letter in the description below.  E.g. &quot;(W closed)&quot; means a warning in the &quot;closed&quot; category.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Optional warnings are enabled by using the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma or the <b>-w</b> and  <b>-W</b> switches.  Warnings may be captured by setting $SIG{__WARN__} to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead of printing it.  See perlvar.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled with the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma or the  <b>-X</b> switch.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See &quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma. See warnings.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a letter.<dl>
<dt>
<i>accept()</i> on closed socket %s</dt>
<dd>
(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check the return value of your  <i>socket()</i> call?  See &quot;accept&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Allocation too large: %x</dt>
<dd>
(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
'%c' allowed only after types %s in %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) The modifiers '!', '&lt;' and '&gt;' are allowed in <i>pack()</i> or <i>unpack()</i> only after certain types.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</dt>
<dd>
(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is not imported.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's imported with the &quot;use subs&quot; pragma).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the &quot;CORE::&quot; prefix on the operator (e.g. &quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;) or declare the subroutine to be an object method (see &quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot; in perlsub or attributes).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</dt>
<dd>
(F) You wrote something like &quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot; which doesn't mean anything at all.  To include a &quot;-&quot; character in a transliteration, put it either first or last.  (In the past, &quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot; was synonymous with &quot;tr/a-y//&quot;, which was probably not what you would have expected.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</dt>
<dd>
(S ambiguous) You said something that may not be interpreted the way you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</dt>
<dd>
(S ambiguous) You wrote something like &quot;-foo&quot;, which might be the string &quot;-foo&quot;, or a call to the function &quot;foo&quot;, negated.  If you meant the string, just write &quot;-foo&quot;.  If you meant the function call, write &quot;-foo()&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ambiguous use of %c resolved as operator %c</dt>
<dd>
(S ambiguous) &quot;%&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, and &quot;*&quot; are both infix operators (modulus, bitwise and, and multiplication)  <i>and</i> initial special characters (denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something like &quot;*foo * foo&quot; that might be interpreted as either of them.  We assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try to make it more clear -- in the example given, you might write &quot;*foo * foo()&quot; if you really meant to multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved to %c%s</dt>
<dd>
(W ambiguous) You wrote something like &quot;@{foo}&quot;, which might be asking for the variable @foo, or it might be calling a function named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference.  If you wanted the variable, you can just write @foo.  If you wanted to call the function, write &quot;@{foo()}&quot; ... or you could just not have a variable and a function with the same name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</dt>
<dd>
(W ambiguous) You wrote something like &quot;${foo[2]}&quot; (where foo represents the name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number 2 of the array named @foo, in which case please write $foo[2], or you might have meant to pass an anonymous arrayref to the function named foo, and then do a scalar deref on the value it returns.  If you meant that, write &quot;${foo([2])}&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In regular expressions, the &quot;${foo[2]}&quot; syntax is sometimes necessary to disambiguate between array subscripts and character classes. &quot;/$length[2345]/&quot;, for instance, will be interpreted as $length followed by the character class &quot;[2345]&quot;.  If an array subscript is what you want, you can avoid the warning by changing &quot;/${length[2345]}/&quot; to the unsightly &quot;/${\$length[2345]}/&quot;, by renaming your array to something that does not coincide with a built-in keyword, or by simply turning off warnings with &quot;no warnings 'ambiguous';&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to redirect STDIN using '&lt;'.  Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and into a pipe to another command.  You need to choose one or the other, though nothing's stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script which 'splits' output into two streams, such as<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;<br/>
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {<br/>
        print;<br/>
        print OUT;<br/>
    }<br/>
    close OUT;<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) The pattern match (&quot;//&quot;), substitution (&quot;s///&quot;), and transliteration (&quot;tr///&quot;) operators work on scalar values.  If you apply one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the length of an array, or the population info of a hash) and then work on that scalar value.  This is probably not what you meant to do.  See &quot;grep&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;map&quot; in perlfunc for alternatives.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Arg too short for msgsnd</dt>
<dd>
(F) <i>msgsnd()</i> requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Argument &quot;%s&quot; isn't numeric%s</dt>
<dd>
(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you forgot the ) that closes the argument list.  (Layers take care of transforming data between external and internal representations.)  Perl stopped parsing the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push this layer.  If your program didn't explicitly request the failing operation, it may be the result of the value of the environment variable PERLIO.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
A sequence of multiple spaces in a charnames alias definition is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You defined a character name which had multiple space characters in a row.  Change them to single spaces.  Usually these names are defined in the &quot;:alias&quot; import argument to &quot;use charnames&quot;, but they could be defined by a translator installed into $^H{charnames}. See &quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in charnames.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
assertion botched: %s</dt>
<dd>
(X) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Assertion %s failed: file &quot;%s&quot;, line %d</dt>
<dd>
(X) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Assigning non-zero to $[ is no longer possible</dt>
<dd>
(F) When the &quot;array_base&quot; feature is disabled (e.g., under &quot;use v5.16;&quot;) the special variable $[, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Assignment to both a list and a scalar</dt>
<dd>
(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't know which context to supply to the right side.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to access disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash</dt>
<dd>
(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in the current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to bless into a freed package</dt>
<dd>
(F) You wrote &quot;bless $foo&quot; with one argument after somehow causing the current package to be freed.  Perl cannot figure out what to do, so it throws up in hands in despair.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to bless into a reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the <i>bless()</i> operator is expected to be the name of the package to bless the resulting object into.  You've supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    bless $self, $proto;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
when you intended<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    bless $self, ref($proto) || $proto;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you actually want to bless into the stringified version of the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for example by:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    bless $self, &quot;$proto&quot;;<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to clear deleted array</dt>
<dd>
(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being freed. Freed values are not supposed to be visible to Perl code.  This can also happen if XS code calls &quot;av_clear&quot; from a custom magic callback on the array.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to delete disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash</dt>
<dd>
(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key which is not in its key set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to delete readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash</dt>
<dd>
(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been declared readonly from a restricted hash.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%x</dt>
<dd>
(S internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that will be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be outside any of those arenas.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to free nonexistent shared string '%s'%s</dt>
<dd>
(S internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal table of strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other strings.  This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count of a string that can no longer be found in the table.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to free temp prematurely: SV 0x%x</dt>
<dd>
(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the  <i>free_tmps()</i> routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the SV before the  <i>free_tmps()</i> routine gets a chance, which means that the  <i>free_tmps()</i> routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to free it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</dt>
<dd>
(S internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x%x</dt>
<dd>
(S internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed. This could indicate that  <i>SvREFCNT_dec()</i> was called too many times, or that  <i>SvREFCNT_inc()</i> was called too few times, or that the SV was mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been corrupted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</dt>
<dd>
(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a function, or a computed expression) to the &quot;p&quot;  <i>pack()</i> template.  This means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement.  Use literals or global values as arguments to the &quot;p&quot;  <i>pack()</i> template to avoid this warning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to reload %s aborted.</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to load a file with &quot;use&quot; or &quot;require&quot; that failed to compile once already.  Perl will not try to compile this file again unless you delete its entry from %INC.  See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;%INC&quot; in perlvar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to set length of freed array</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) You tried to set the length of an array which has been freed.  You can do this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the last index of an array and later assigning through that reference.  For example<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $r = do {my @a; \$#a};<br/>
    $$r = 503<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</dt>
<dd>
(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to <i>substr()</i> used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.  Perhaps you forgot to dereference it first.  See &quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attribute &quot;locked&quot; is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You have used the attributes pragma to modify the &quot;locked&quot; attribute on a code reference.  The :locked attribute is obsolete, has had no effect since 5005 threads were removed, and will be removed in a future release of Perl 5.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attribute prototype(%s) discards earlier prototype attribute in same sub</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) A sub was declared as sub foo : prototype(A) : prototype(B) {}, for example.  Since each sub can only have one prototype, the earlier declaration(s) are discarded while the last one is applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attribute &quot;unique&quot; is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You have used the attributes pragma to modify the &quot;unique&quot; attribute on an array, hash or scalar reference. The :unique attribute has had no effect since Perl 5.8.8, and will be removed in a future release of Perl 5.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
av_reify called on tied array</dt>
<dd>
(S debugging) This indicates that something went wrong and Perl got <i>very</i> confused about @_ or @DB::args being tied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad arg length for %s, is %u, should be %d</dt>
<dd>
(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of <i>msgctl()</i>, <i>semctl()</i> or  <i>shmctl()</i>.  In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively, sizeof(struct&#160;msqid_ds&#160;*), sizeof(struct&#160;semid_ds&#160;*), and sizeof(struct&#160;shmid_ds&#160;*).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad evalled substitution pattern</dt>
<dd>
(F) You've used the &quot;/e&quot; switch to evaluate the replacement for a substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate, most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad filehandle: %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the symbol has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an  <i>open()</i>, or did it in another package.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad <i>free()</i> ignored</dt>
<dd>
(S malloc) An internal routine called <i>free()</i> on something that had never been  <i>malloc()</i>ed in the first place.  Mandatory, but can be disabled by setting environment variable &quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot; to 0.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems with &quot;hard&quot; dynamic linking, like &quot;AIX&quot; and &quot;OS/2&quot;.  It is a bug of &quot;Berkeley DB&quot; which is left unnoticed if &quot;DB&quot; uses  <i>forgiving</i> system <i>malloc()</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad hash</dt>
<dd>
(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Badly placed ()'s</dt>
<dd>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad name after %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then didn't finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside of quotes, so<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $var = 'myvar';<br/>
    $sym = mypack::$var;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
is not the same as<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $var = 'myvar';<br/>
    $sym = &quot;mypack::$var&quot;;<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad plugin affecting keyword '%s'</dt>
<dd>
(F) An extension using the keyword plugin mechanism violated the plugin API.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad <i>realloc()</i> ignored</dt>
<dd>
(S malloc) An internal routine called <i>realloc()</i> on something that had never been  <i>malloc()</i>ed in the first place.  Mandatory, but can be disabled by setting the environment variable &quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot; to 1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad symbol for array</dt>
<dd>
(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something that wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad symbol for dirhandle</dt>
<dd>
(P) An internal request asked to add a dirhandle entry to something that wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad symbol for filehandle</dt>
<dd>
(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something that wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad symbol for hash</dt>
<dd>
(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad symbol for scalar</dt>
<dd>
(P) An internal request asked to add a scalar entry to something that wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bareword found in conditional</dt>
<dd>
(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    open FOO || die;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as a bareword:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use constant TYPO =&gt; 1;<br/>
    if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The &quot;strict&quot; pragma is useful in avoiding such errors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bareword &quot;%s&quot; not allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in use</dt>
<dd>
(F) With &quot;strict subs&quot; in use, a bareword is only allowed as a subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the &quot;=&gt;&quot; symbol.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers to nonexistent package</dt>
<dd>
(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form &quot;Foo::&quot;, but the compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that point.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a package?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</dt>
<dd>
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN subroutine.  Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is exited.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl found a &quot;BEGIN {}&quot; subroutine (or a &quot;use&quot; directive, which implies a &quot;BEGIN {}&quot;) after one or more compilation errors had already occurred.  Since the intended environment for the &quot;BEGIN {}&quot; could not be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
\%d better written as $%d</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables. The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if there are more than 9 backreferences.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Binary number &gt; 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</dt>
<dd>
(W portable) The binary number you specified is larger than 2**32-1 (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See perlport for more on portability concerns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>bind()</i> on closed socket %s</dt>
<dd>
(W closed) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check the return value of your  <i>socket()</i> call?  See &quot;bind&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>binmode()</i> on closed filehandle %s</dt>
<dd>
(W unopened) You tried <i>binmode()</i> on a filehandle that was never opened. Check your control flow and number of arguments.</dd>

(D deprecated) Use of an unescaped &quot;{&quot; immediately following a &quot;\b&quot; or &quot;\B&quot; is now deprecated so as to reserve its use for Perl itself in a future release.  You can either precede the brace with a backslash, or enclose it in square brackets; the latter is the way to go if the pattern delimiters are &quot;{}&quot;.</dd>

Bit vector size &gt; 32 non-portable</dt>
<dd>
(W portable) Using bit vector sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.</dd>

Bizarre copy of %s</dt>
<dd>
(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that is not copiable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bizarre SvTYPE [%d]</dt>
<dd>
(P) When starting a new thread or returning values from a thread, Perl encountered an invalid data type.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</dt>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  While Perl was preparing to iterate over %ENV, it encountered a logical name or symbol definition which was too long, so it was truncated to the string shown.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Callback called exit</dt>
<dd>
(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via <i>call_sv()</i> exited by calling exit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s() called too early to check prototype</dt>
<dd>
(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check that the call conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype checking.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid the warning.  See perlsub.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Calling POSIX::%s() is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You called a function whose use is deprecated.  See the function's name in POSIX for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Cannot compress integer in pack</dt>
<dd>
(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was too large to compress.  The BER compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers, and you attempted to compress Infinity or a very large number (&gt; 1e308). See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Cannot compress negative numbers in pack</dt>
<dd>
(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was negative.  The BER compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Cannot convert a reference to %s to typeglob</dt>
<dd>
(F) You manipulated Perl's symbol table directly, stored a reference in it, then tried to access that symbol via conventional Perl syntax. The access triggers Perl to autovivify that typeglob, but it there is no legal conversion from that type of reference to a typeglob.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Cannot copy to %s</dt>
<dd>
(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy a value to an internal type that cannot be directly assigned to.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Cannot find encoding &quot;%s&quot;</dt>

<dl>
<dt>
Cannot set tied @DB::args</dt>
<dd>
(F) &quot;caller&quot; tried to set @DB::args, but found it tied.  Tying @DB::args is not supported.  (Before this error was added, it used to crash.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Cannot tie unreifiable array</dt>
<dd>
(P) You somehow managed to call &quot;tie&quot; on an array that does not keep a reference count on its arguments and cannot be made to do so.  Such arrays are not even supposed to be accessible to Perl code, but are only used internally.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can only compress unsigned integers in pack</dt>
<dd>
(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was not an integer.  The BER compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers, and you attempted to compress something else.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't bless non-reference value</dt>
<dd>
(F) Only hard references may be blessed.  This is how Perl &quot;enforces&quot; encapsulation of objects.  See perlobj.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't &quot;break&quot; in a loop topicalizer</dt>
<dd>
(F) You called &quot;break&quot;, but you're in a &quot;foreach&quot; block rather than a &quot;given&quot; block.  You probably meant to use &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't &quot;break&quot; outside a given block</dt>

<dl>
<dt>
Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the object reference or package name contains an undefined value.  Something like this will reproduce the error:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $BADREF = undef;<br/>
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;<br/>
    $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; on unblessed reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) A method call must know in what package it's supposed to run.  It ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but you didn't supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn't an object reference until it has been blessed.  See perlobj.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; without a package or object reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the object reference or package name contains an expression that returns a defined value which is neither an object reference nor a package name. Something like this will reproduce the error:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $BADREF = 42;<br/>

<dl>
<dt>
Can't call <i>mro_method_changed_in()</i> on anonymous symbol table</dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't chdir to %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You called &quot;perl -x/foo/bar&quot;, but <i>/foo/bar</i> is not a directory that you can chdir to, possibly because it doesn't exist.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>
Can't coerce %s to %s in %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries (typeglobs), can't be forced to stop being what they are.  So you can't say things like:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    *foo += 1;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You CAN say<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $foo = *foo;<br/>
    $foo += 1;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
but then $foo no longer contains a glob.</dd>

<dd>
(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared as &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; variables.  They must have ordinary identifiers as names.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't &quot;default&quot; outside a topicalizer</dt>
<dd>
(F) You have used a &quot;default&quot; block that is neither inside a &quot;foreach&quot; loop nor a &quot;given&quot; block.  (Note that this error is issued on exit from the &quot;default&quot; block, so you won't get the error if you use an explicit &quot;continue&quot;.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't do inplace edit: %s is not a regular file</dt>
<dd>
(S inplace) You tried to use the <b>-i</b> switch on a special file, such as a file in /dev, a FIFO or an uneditable directory.  The file was ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't do inplace edit on %s: %s</dt>
<dd>
(S inplace) The creation of the new file failed for the indicated reason.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't do inplace edit without backup</dt>
<dd>
(F) You're on a system such as MS-DOS that gets confused if you try reading from a deleted (but still opened) file.  You have to say &quot;-i.bak&quot;, or some such.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't do inplace edit: %s would not be unique</dt>
<dd>
(S inplace) Your filesystem does not support filenames longer than 14 characters and Perl was unable to create a unique filename during inplace editing with the  <b>-i</b> switch.  The file was ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't do waitpid with flags</dt>
<dd>
(F) This machine doesn't have either <i>waitpid()</i> or <i>wait4()</i>, so only  <i>waitpid()</i> without flags is emulated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't emulate -%s on #! line</dt>
<dd>
(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make sense at this point.  For example, it'd be kind of silly to put a  <b>-x</b> on the #! line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't %s %s-endian %ss on this platform</dt>
<dd>
(F) Your platform's byte-order is neither big-endian nor little-endian, or it has a very strange pointer size.  Packing and unpacking big- or little-endian floating point values and pointers may not be possible. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't exec &quot;%s&quot;: %s</dt>
<dd>
(W exec) A <i>system()</i>, <i>exec()</i>, or piped open call could not execute the named program for the indicated reason.  Typical reasons include: the permissions were wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in $ENV{PATH}, the executable in question was compiled for another architecture, or the #! line in a script points to an interpreter that can't be run for similar reasons.  (Or maybe your system doesn't support #! at all.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't exec %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because that's what the #! line said.  If that's not what you wanted, you may need to mention &quot;perl&quot; on the #! line somewhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't execute %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the copies of the script to execute found in the PATH did not have correct permissions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't find an opnumber for &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) A string of a form &quot;CORE::word&quot; was given to <i>prototype()</i>, but there is no builtin with the name &quot;word&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't find %s character property &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used &quot;\p{}&quot; or &quot;\P{}&quot; but the character property by that name could not be found.  Maybe you misspelled the name of the property? See &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops for a complete list of available official properties.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't find label %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You said to goto a label that isn't mentioned anywhere that it's possible for us to go to.  See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't find %s on PATH</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not be found in the PATH.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't find %s on PATH, '.' not in PATH</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not be found in the PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions.  The script exists in the current directory, but PATH prohibits running it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines.  This message means that the closing delimiter was omitted.  Because bracketed quotes count nesting levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    print q(The character '(' starts a side comment.);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you're getting this error from a here-document, you may have included unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag or there may not be a linebreak after it.  A good programmer's editor will have a way to help you find these characters (or lack of characters).  See perlop for the full details on here-documents.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't find Unicode property definition &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) You may have tried to use &quot;\p&quot; which means a Unicode property (for example &quot;\p{Lu}&quot; matches all uppercase letters).  If you did mean to use a Unicode property, see &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops for a complete list of available properties.  If you didn't mean to use a Unicode property, escape the &quot;\p&quot;, either by &quot;\\p&quot; (just the &quot;\p&quot;) or by &quot;\Q\p&quot; (the rest of the string, or until &quot;\E&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't fork: %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) A fatal error occurred while trying to fork while opening a pipeline.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't fork, trying again in 5 seconds</dt>
<dd>
(W pipe) A fork in a piped open failed with EAGAIN and will be retried after five seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</dt>
<dd>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes. Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to the access-checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL  <i>stat()</i> routine, because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access-checking routine knows about the Perl &quot;stat&quot; operator and file tests, so you shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't get pipe mailbox device name</dt>
<dd>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  After creating a mailbox to act as a pipe, Perl can't retrieve its name for later use.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</dt>
<dd>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl asked $GETSYI how big you want your mailbox buffers to be, and didn't get an answer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't &quot;goto&quot; into the middle of a foreach loop</dt>
<dd>
(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump into the middle of a foreach loop.  You can't get there from here.  See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't &quot;goto&quot; out of a pseudo block</dt>
<dd>
(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump out of what might look like a block, except that it isn't a proper block.  This usually occurs if you tried to jump out of a  <i>sort()</i> block or subroutine, which is a no-no. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't goto subroutine from an eval-%s</dt>
<dd>
(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can't be used to jump out of an eval &quot;string&quot; or block.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't goto subroutine from a sort sub (or similar callback)</dt>
<dd>
(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can't be used to jump out of the comparison sub for a  <i>sort()</i>, or from a similar callback (such as the  <i>reduce()</i> function in List::Util).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine</dt>
<dd>
(F) The deeply magical &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can only replace one subroutine call for another.  It can't manufacture one out of whole cloth.  In general you should be calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD routine anyway.  See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</dt>
<dd>
(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.  This situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't kill a non-numeric process ID</dt>
<dd>
(F) Process identifiers must be (signed) integers.  It is a fatal error to attempt to  <i>kill()</i> an undefined, empty-string or otherwise non-numeric process identifier.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't &quot;last&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
<dd>
(F) A &quot;last&quot; statement was executed to break out of the current block, except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a current block.  Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn't count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn't a block given to  <i>sort()</i>, <i>map()</i> or <i>grep()</i>.  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.  See &quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't linearize anonymous symbol table</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl tried to calculate the method resolution order (MRO) of a package, but failed because the package stash has no name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't load '%s' for module %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension. This may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one that is incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known to happen between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your dynamic extension was built against an older version of the library that is installed on your system.  You may need to rebuild your old dynamic extensions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't localize lexical variable %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a lexical variable using &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;.  This is not allowed.  If you want to localize a package variable of the same name, qualify it with the package name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't localize through a reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) You said something like &quot;local $$ref&quot;, which Perl can't currently handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of whatever $ref pointed to after the scope of the  <i>local()</i> is finished, it can't be sure that $ref will still be a reference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't locate %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You said to &quot;do&quot; (or &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot;) a file that couldn't be found. Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC, unless the file name included the full path to the file.  Perhaps you need to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where the extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name to @INC.  Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the file.  See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc and lib.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't locate auto/%s.al in @INC</dt>
<dd>
(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows autoload, but there is no function to autoload.  Most probable causes are a misprint in a function/method name or a failure to &quot;AutoSplit&quot; the file, say, by doing &quot;make install&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't locate loadable object for module %s in @INC</dt>
<dd>
(F) The module you loaded is trying to load an external library, like for example,  <i>foo.so</i> or <i>bar.dll</i>, but the DynaLoader module was unable to locate this library.  See DynaLoader.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't locate object method &quot;%s&quot; via package &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that particular method, nor does any of its base classes.  See perlobj.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't locate object method &quot;%s&quot; via package &quot;%s&quot; (perhaps you forgot to load &quot;%s&quot;?)</dt>
<dd>
(F) You called a method on a class that did not exist, and the method could not be found in UNIVERSAL.  This often means that a method requires a package that has not been loaded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) The @ISA array contained the name of another package that doesn't seem to exist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't locate PerlIO%s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to use in <i>open()</i> a PerlIO layer that does not exist, e.g. open(FH, &quot;&gt;:nosuchlayer&quot;, &quot;somefile&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't make list assignment to %ENV on this system</dt>
<dd>
(F) List assignment to %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably VMS.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't make loaded symbols global on this platform while loading %s</dt>
<dd>
(S) A module passed the flag 0x01 to <i>DynaLoader::dl_load_file()</i> to request that symbols from the stated file are made available globally within the process, but that functionality is not available on this platform.  Whilst the module likely will still work, this may prevent the perl interpreter from loading other XS-based extensions which need to link directly to functions defined in the C or XS code in the stated file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't modify %s in %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You aren't allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try to change it, such as with an auto-increment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't modify nonexistent substring</dt>
<dd>
(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a <i>substr()</i> was handed a NULL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call</dt>
<dd>
(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as such.  See &quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't msgrcv to read-only var</dt>
<dd>
(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as a receive buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't &quot;next&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
<dd>
(F) A &quot;next&quot; statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but there isn't a current block.  Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn't count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn't a block given to  <i>sort()</i>, <i>map()</i> or  <i>grep()</i>.  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.  See &quot;next&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't open %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to run a perl built with MAD support with the PERL_XMLDUMP environment variable set, but the file named by that variable could not be opened.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't open %s: %s</dt>
<dd>
(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; filehandle, either implicitly under the &quot;-n&quot; or &quot;-p&quot; command-line switches, or explicitly, failed for the indicated reason.  Usually this is because you don't have read permission for a file which you named on the command line.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-e</b> switch, but <i>/dev/null</i> (or your operating system's equivalent) could not be opened.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't open a reference</dt>
<dd>
(W io) You tried to open a scalar reference for reading or writing, using the 3-arg  <i>open()</i> syntax:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    open FH, '&gt;', $ref;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
but your version of perl is compiled without perlio, and this form of open is not supported.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't open bidirectional pipe</dt>
<dd>
(W pipe) You tried to say &quot;open(CMD, &quot;|cmd|&quot;)&quot;, which is not supported. You can try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such as IPC::Open2.  Alternately, direct the pipe's output to a file using &quot;&gt;&quot;, and then read it in under a different file handle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't open error file %s as stderr</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '2&gt;' or '2&gt;&gt;' on the command line for writing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't open input file %s as stdin</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&lt;' on the command line for reading.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't open output file %s as stdout</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&gt;' or '&gt;&gt;' on the command line for writing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't open output pipe (name: %s)</dt>
<dd>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and couldn't open the pipe into which to send data destined for stdout.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't open perl script &quot;%s&quot;: %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you're debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies on the shell's $PATH search, the -S option causes perl to do that search, so you don't have to type the path or &quot;`which $scriptname`&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't read CRTL environ</dt>
<dd>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read an element of %ENV from the CRTL's internal environment array and discovered the array was missing.  You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ or define  <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see perlvms) so that environ is not searched.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't &quot;redo&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
<dd>
(F) A &quot;redo&quot; statement was executed to restart the current block, but there isn't a current block.  Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn't count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn't a block given to  <i>sort()</i>, <i>map()</i> or  <i>grep()</i>.  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.  See &quot;redo&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file</dt>
<dd>
(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup file.  Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it with the modified file.  The file was left unmodified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</dt>
<dd>
(S inplace) The rename done by the <b>-i</b> switch failed for some reason, probably because you don't have write permission to the directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode</dt>
<dd>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried to reopen it to accept binary data.  Alas, it failed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't reset %ENV on this system</dt>
<dd>
(F) You called &quot;reset('E')&quot; or similar, which tried to reset all variables in the current package beginning with &quot;E&quot;.  In the main package, that includes %ENV.  Resetting %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably VMS.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't resolve method &quot;%s&quot; overloading &quot;%s&quot; in package &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F)(P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as opposed to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the package.  If the method name is &quot;???&quot;, this is an internal error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue.  This is not allowed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't return outside a subroutine</dt>
<dd>
(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where there was no subroutine call to return out of.  See perlsub.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't return %s to lvalue scalar context</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue subroutine, but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl think you meant to return only one value.  You probably meant to write parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which tell Perl that the call should be in list context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't stat script &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(P) For some reason you can't <i>fstat()</i> the script even though you have it open already.  Bizarre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't take log of %g</dt>
<dd>
(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the logarithm of a negative number or zero.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that for the negative numbers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't take sqrt of %g</dt>
<dd>
(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the square root of a negative number.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't undef active subroutine</dt>
<dd>
(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running.  You can, however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.  Go figure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't upgrade %s (%d) to %d</dt>
<dd>
(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds &quot;members&quot; to an SV, making it into a more specialized kind of SV.  The top several SV types are so specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This message indicates that such a conversion was attempted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use '%c' after -mname</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-m</b> switch, but you put something other than &quot;=&quot; after the module name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use anonymous symbol table for method lookup</dt>
<dd>
(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a symbol table that doesn't have a name.  Symbol tables can become anonymous for example by undefining stashes: &quot;undef %Some::Package::&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use an undefined value as %s reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must be a defined value.  This helps to delurk some insidious errors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use bareword (&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in use</dt>
<dd>
(F) Only hard references are allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;.  Symbolic references are disallowed.  See perlref.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use %! because Errno.pm is not available</dt>
<dd>
(F) The first time the &quot;%!&quot; hash is used, perl automatically loads the Errno.pm module.  The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to provide symbolic names for $! errno values.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use both '&lt;' and '&gt;' after type '%c' in %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) A type cannot be forced to have both big-endian and little-endian byte-order at the same time, so this combination of modifiers is not allowed.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use %s for loop variable</dt>
<dd>
(F) Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a loop variable on a foreach.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use global %s in &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location (namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to have variables in your program that looked like magical variables but weren't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use '%c' in a group with different byte-order in %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You attempted to force a different byte-order on a type that is already inside a group with a byte-order modifier. For example you cannot force little-endianness on a type that is inside a big-endian group.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use &quot;my %s&quot; in sort comparison</dt>
<dd>
(F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons. You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator, and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable. Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the lexical variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use %s ref as %s ref</dt>
<dd>
(F) You've mixed up your reference types.  You have to dereference a reference of the type needed.  You can use the  <i>ref()</i> function to test the type of the reference, if need be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use string (&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in use</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use string (&quot;%s&quot;...) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in use</dt>
<dd>
(F) You've told Perl to dereference a string, something which &quot;use strict&quot; blocks to prevent it happening accidentally.  See &quot;Symbolic references&quot; in perlref.  This can be triggered by an &quot;@&quot; or &quot;$&quot; in a double-quoted string immediately before interpolating a variable, for example in &quot;user @$twitter_id&quot;, which says to treat the contents of $twitter_id as an array reference; use a &quot;\&quot; to have a literal &quot;@&quot; symbol followed by the contents of $twitter_id: &quot;user \@$twitter_id&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use subscript on %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a subscript.  But to the left of the brackets was an expression that didn't look like a hash or array reference, or anything else subscriptable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use \%c to mean $%c in expression</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that creates a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular expression pattern.  Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a value that prints out looking like  <i>SCALAR</i>(0xdecaf).  Use the $1 form instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't weaken a nonreference</dt>
<dd>
(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference.  Only references can be weakened.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't &quot;when&quot; outside a topicalizer</dt>
<dd>
(F) You have used a <i>when()</i> block that is neither inside a &quot;foreach&quot; loop nor a &quot;given&quot; block.  (Note that this error is issued on exit from the &quot;when&quot; block, so you won't get the error if the match fails, or if you use an explicit &quot;continue&quot;.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't x= to read-only value</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value) with an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself. Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Character following &quot;\c&quot; must be printable ASCII</dt>
<dd>
(F)(D deprecated, syntax) In &quot;\c<i>X</i>&quot;, <i>X</i> must be a printable (non-control) ASCII character.  This is fatal starting in v5.20 for non-ASCII characters, and it is planned to make this fatal in all instances in Perl v5.22.  In the cases where it isn't fatal, the character this evaluates to is derived by exclusive or'ing the code point of this character with 0x40.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that ASCII characters that don't map to control characters are discouraged here as well, and will generate the warning (when enabled) &quot;&quot;\c%c&quot; is more clearly written simply as &quot;%s&quot;&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Character in 'C' format wrapped in pack</dt>

<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
where $x is either less than 0 or more than 255; the &quot;C&quot; format is only for encoding native operating system characters (ASCII, EBCDIC, and so on) and not for Unicode characters, so Perl behaved as if you meant<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<br/>
   unpack(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;\x{2a1}&quot;)<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
where the format expects to process a byte (a character with a value below 256), but a higher value was provided instead.  Perl uses the value modulus 256 instead, as if you had provided:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

&#160;</div>
<br/>
    pack(&quot;U0W&quot;, $x)<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
where $x is either less than 0 or more than 255.  However, &quot;U0&quot;-mode expects all values to fall in the interval [0, 255], so Perl behaved as if you meant:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<br/>
   pack(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;\x{1f3}b&quot;)<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
where the format expects to process a sequence of bytes (character with a value below 256), but some of the characters had a higher value.  Perl uses the character values modulus 256 instead, as if you had provided:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>

<br/>
   unpack(&quot;s&quot;, &quot;\x{1f3}b&quot;)<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;\c%c&quot; is more clearly written simply as &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) The &quot;\c<i>X</i>&quot; construct is intended to be a way to specify non-printable characters.  You used it for a printable one, which is better written as simply itself, perhaps preceded by a backslash for non-word characters.  Doing it the way you did is not portable between ASCII and EBCDIC platforms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Cloning substitution context is unimplemented</dt>
<dd>
(F) Creating a new thread inside the &quot;s///&quot; operator is not supported.</dd>

<i>close()</i> on unopened filehandle %s</dt>
<dd>
(W unopened) You tried to close a filehandle that was never opened.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Closure prototype called</dt>
<dd>
(F) If a closure has attributes, the subroutine passed to an attribute handler is the prototype that is cloned when a new closure is created. This subroutine cannot be called.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Code missing after '/'</dt>
<dd>
(F) You had a (sub-)template that ends with a '/'.  There must be another template code following the slash.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, may not be portable</dt>
<dd>
(S non_unicode) You had a code point above the Unicode maximum of U+10FFFF.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl allows strings to contain a superset of Unicode code points, up to the limit of what is storable in an unsigned integer on your system, but these may not be accepted by other languages/systems.  At one time, it was legal in some standards to have code points up to 0x7FFF_FFFF, but not higher.  Code points above 0xFFFF_FFFF require larger than a 32 bit word.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s: Command not found</dt>
<dd>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> or another shell instead of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.  The #! line at the top of your file could look like<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Compilation failed in require</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl could not compile a file specified in a &quot;require&quot; statement. Perl uses this generic message when none of the errors that it encountered were severe enough to halt compilation immediately.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Complex regular subexpression recursion limit (%d) exceeded</dt>
<dd>
(W regexp) The regular expression engine uses recursion in complex situations where back-tracking is required.  Recursion depth is limited to 32766, or perhaps less in architectures where the stack cannot grow arbitrarily.  (&quot;Simple&quot; and &quot;medium&quot; situations are handled without recursion and are not subject to a limit.)  Try shortening the string under examination; looping in Perl code (e.g. with &quot;while&quot;) rather than in the regular expression engine; or rewriting the regular expression so that it is simpler or backtracks less.  (See perlfaq2 for information on  <i>Mastering Regular Expressions</i>.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>connect()</i> on closed socket %s</dt>
<dd>
(W closed) You tried to do a connect on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check the return value of your  <i>socket()</i> call?  See &quot;connect&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Constant(%s): Call to &amp;{$^H{%s}} did not return a defined value</dt>

(F) The subroutine registered to handle constant overloading (see overload) or a custom charnames handler (see &quot;CUSTOM TRANSLATORS&quot; in charnames) returned an undefined value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Constant(%s): $^H{%s} is not defined</dt>
<dd>
(F) The parser found inconsistencies while attempting to define an overloaded constant.  Perhaps you forgot to load the corresponding overload pragma?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Constant is not %s reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the &quot;use constant&quot; pragma) is being dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of reference. The message indicates the type of reference that was expected.  This usually indicates a syntax error in dereferencing the constant value. See &quot;Constant Functions&quot; in perlsub and constant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

&amp;CORE::%s cannot be called directly</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to call a subroutine in the &quot;CORE::&quot; namespace with &amp;foo syntax or through a reference.  Some subroutines in this package cannot yet be called that way, but must be called as barewords.  Something like this will work:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dt>
Deep recursion on subroutine &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(W recursion) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly) 100 times more than it has returned.  This probably indicates an infinite recursion, unless you're writing strange benchmark programs, in which case it indicates something else.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Although &quot;defined %hash&quot; is false on a plain not-yet-used hash, it becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances, including iterators, weak references, stash names, even remaining true after &quot;undef %hash&quot;. These things make &quot;defined %hash&quot; fairly useless in practice.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If a check for non-empty is what you wanted then just put it in boolean context (see &quot;Scalar values&quot; in perldata):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    if (%hash) {<br/>
       # not empty<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you had &quot;defined %Foo::Bar::QUUX&quot; to check whether such a package variable exists then that's never really been reliable, and isn't a good way to enquire about the features of a package, or whether it's loaded, etc.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
Deprecated use of <i>my()</i> in false conditional</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You used a declaration similar to &quot;my $x if 0&quot;.  There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration includes a false conditional.  Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of static variable.  Since we intend to fix this bug, we don't want people relying on this behavior.  You can achieve a similar static effect by declaring the variable in a separate block outside the function, eg<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
becomes<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    { my $x; sub f { return $x++ } }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Beginning with perl 5.10.0, you can also use &quot;state&quot; variables to have lexicals that are initialized only once (see feature):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub f { state $x; return $x++ }<br/>

DESTROY created new reference to dead object '%s'</dt>
<dd>
(F) A <i>DESTROY()</i> method created a new reference to the object which is just being DESTROYed.  Perl is confused, and prefers to abort rather than to create a dangling reference.</dd>

(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's traditional to end such a file with a &quot;1;&quot;, though any true value would do.  See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
(Did you mean &quot;local&quot; instead of &quot;our&quot;?)</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) Remember that &quot;our&quot; does not localize the declared global variable.  You have declared it again in the same lexical scope, which seems superfluous.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)</dt>

<dt>
(Do you need to predeclare %s?)</dt>
<dd>
(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;.  It often means a subroutine or module name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet.  This may be because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing &quot;sub&quot;, &quot;package&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot; statement.  If you're referencing something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have to define the subroutine or package before the current location.  You can use an empty &quot;sub foo;&quot; or &quot;package FOO;&quot; to enter a &quot;forward&quot; declaration.</dd>

<dd>
(S syntax) There is no keyword &quot;elseif&quot; in Perl because Larry thinks it's ugly.  Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method named &quot;elseif&quot; for the class returned by the following block.  This is unlikely to be what you want.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Error converting file specification %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Because Perl may have to deal with file specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a single form when it must operate on them directly.  Either you've passed an invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a case the conversion routines don't handle.  Drat.</dd>

Escape literal pattern white space under /x</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You compiled a regular expression pattern with &quot;/x&quot; to ignore white space, and you used, as a literal, one of the characters that Perl plans to eventually treat as white space.  The character must be escaped somehow, or it will work differently on a future Perl that does treat it as white space.  The easiest way is to insert a backslash immediately before it, or to enclose it with square brackets.  This change is to bring Perl into conformance with Unicode recommendations. Here are the five characters that generate this warning: U+0085 NEXT LINE, U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK, U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK, U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR, and U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR.</dd>

Eval-group not allowed at runtime, use re 'eval' in regex m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk, it is not allowed.  If you insist, you may still do this by using the &quot;re 'eval'&quot; pragma or by explicitly building the pattern from an interpolated string at run time and using that in an  <i>eval()</i>.  See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</dd>

Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval' in regex m/%s/</dt>

(F) The &quot;(?[...])&quot; extended character class regular expression construct only allows character classes (including character class escapes like &quot;\d&quot;), operators, and parentheses.  The one exception is &quot;(?flags:...)&quot; containing at least one flag and exactly one &quot;(?[...])&quot; construct. This allows a regular expression containing just &quot;(?[...])&quot; to be interpolated.  If you see this error message, then you probably have some other &quot;(?...)&quot; construct inside your character class.  See &quot;Extended Bracketed Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.</dd>

(W regexp)(F) A character class range must start and end at a literal character, not another character class like &quot;\d&quot; or &quot;[:alpha:]&quot;.  The &quot;-&quot; in your false range is interpreted as a literal &quot;-&quot;.  In a &quot;(?[...])&quot; construct, this is an error, rather than a warning.

Field too wide in 'u' format in pack</dt>
<dd>
(W pack) Each line in an uuencoded string starts with a length indicator which can't encode values above 63.  So there is no point in asking for a line length bigger than that.  Perl will behave as if you specified &quot;u63&quot; as the format.</dd>

Filehandle %s opened only for input</dt>
<dd>
(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.  If you intended it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&lt;&quot; or nothing.

(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing, If you intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&gt;&quot;.  If you intended only to read from the file, use &quot;&lt;&quot;.  See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc.  Another possibility is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0 (also known as STDIN) for output (maybe you closed STDIN earlier?).</dd>

<dd>
(W closed) The filehandle you're attempting to <i>flock()</i> got itself closed some time before now.  Check your control flow.   <i>flock()</i> operates on filehandles.  Are you attempting to call  <i>flock()</i> on a dirhandle by the same name?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

Usually, this means that you supplied a &quot;glob&quot; pattern that caused the external program to fail and exit with a nonzero status.  If the message indicates that the abnormal exit resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables in config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as if it were csh (e.g. &quot;full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'&quot;); otherwise, make them all empty (except that &quot;d_csh&quot; should be 'undef') so that Perl will think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run &quot;./Configure -S&quot; and rebuild Perl.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
Glob not terminated</dt>
<dd>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in the line, and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
gmtime(%f) failed</dt>
<dd>
(W overflow) You called &quot;gmtime&quot; with a number that it could not handle: too large, too small, or NaN.  The returned value is &quot;undef&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
gmtime(%f) too large</dt>
<dd>
(W overflow) You called &quot;gmtime&quot; with a number that was larger than it can reliably handle and &quot;gmtime&quot; probably returned the wrong date.  This warning is also triggered with NaN (the special not-a-number value).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
gmtime(%f) too small</dt>
<dd>
(W overflow) You called &quot;gmtime&quot; with a number that was smaller than it can reliably handle and &quot;gmtime&quot; probably returned the wrong date.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
Got an error from DosAllocMem</dt>
<dd>
(P) An error peculiar to OS/2.  Most probably you're using an obsolete version of Perl, and this should not happen anyway.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
goto must have label</dt>
<dd>
(F) Unlike with &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot;, you're not allowed to goto an unspecified destination.  See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Goto undefined subroutine%s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to call a subroutine with &quot;goto &amp;sub&quot; syntax, but the indicated subroutine hasn't been defined, or if it was, it has since been undefined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Group name must start with a non-digit word character in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) Group names must follow the rules for perl identifiers, meaning they must start with a non-digit word character.  A common cause of this error is using (?&amp;0) instead of (?0).  See perlre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
()-group starts with a count</dt>
<dd>
(F) A ()-group started with a count.  A count is supposed to follow something: a template character or a ()-group.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s had compilation errors.</dt>
<dd>
(F) The final summary message when a &quot;perl -c&quot; fails.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Had to create %s unexpectedly</dt>
<dd>
(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought to have existed already, but for some reason it didn't, and had to be created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s()</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names in some spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s has too many errors</dt>
<dd>
(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors. Further error messages would likely be uninformative.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</dt>
<dd>
(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1 (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See perlport for more on portability concerns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Identifier too long</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound names (like $A::B).  You've exceeded Perl's limits.  Future versions of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ignoring zero length \N{} in character class in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(W regexp) Named Unicode character escapes (&quot;\N{...}&quot;) may return a zero-length sequence.  When such an escape is used in a character class its behaviour is not well defined.  Check that the correct escape has been used, and the correct charname handler is in scope.</dd>
</dl>

Illegal binary digit %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal binary digit %s ignored</dt>
<dd>
(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.  Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the offending digit.</dd>

<dt>
Illegal character after '_' in prototype for %s : %s</dt>
<dd>
(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype declaration.  The '_' in a prototype must be followed by a ';', indicating the rest of the parameters are optional, or one of '@' or '%', since those two will accept 0 or more final parameters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal character \%o (carriage return)</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it would any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error when Perl was built using standard options.  For some reason, your version of Perl appears to have been built without this support.  Talk to your Perl administrator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s</dt>
<dd>
(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype declaration. Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \, and +. Perhaps you were trying to write a subroutine signature but didn't enable that feature first (&quot;use feature 'signatures'&quot;), so your signature was instead interpreted as a bad prototype.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal declaration of anonymous subroutine</dt>
<dd>
(F) When using the &quot;sub&quot; keyword to construct an anonymous subroutine, you must always specify a block of code.  See perlsub.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal declaration of subroutine %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) A subroutine was not declared correctly.  See perlsub.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal division by zero</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in your logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against meaningless input.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored</dt>
<dd>
(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or A - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number.  Interpretation of the hexadecimal number stopped before the illegal character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal modulus zero</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder.  Most numbers don't take to this kindly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal number of bits in vec</dt>
<dd>
(F) The number of bits in <i>vec()</i> (the third argument) must be a power of two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal octal digit %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used an 8 or 9 in an octal number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal octal digit %s ignored</dt>
<dd>
(W digit) You may have tried to use an 8 or 9 in an octal number. Interpretation of the octal number stopped before the 8 or 9.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal pattern in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) You wrote something like<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 (?+foo)<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The &quot;+&quot; is valid only when followed by digits, indicating a capturing group.  See &quot;(? <i>PARNO</i>)&quot;.</dd>

(X) The PERL5OPT environment variable may only be used to set the following switches:  <b>-[CDIMUdmtw]</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ill-formed CRTL environ value &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the CRTL's internal environ array, and encountered an element without the &quot;=&quot; delimiter used to separate keys from values.  The element is ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</dt>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read a logical name or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over %ENV, and didn't see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
(in cleanup) %s</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a <i>DESTROY()</i> method raised the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by the system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; flag could also result in this warning.  See &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; in perlcall.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Incomplete expression within '(?[ ])' in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) There was a syntax error within the &quot;(?[ ])&quot;.  This can happen if the expression inside the construct was completely empty, or if there are too many or few operands for the number of operators.  Perl is not smart enough to give you a more precise indication as to what is wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Inconsistent hierarchy during C3 merge of class '%s': merging failed on parent '%s'</dt>
<dd>
(F) The method resolution order (MRO) of the given class is not C3-consistent, and you have enabled the C3 MRO for this class.  See the C3 documentation in mro for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
In EBCDIC the v-string components cannot exceed 2147483647</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to EBCDIC.  Internally, v-strings are stored as Unicode code points, and encoded in EBCDIC as UTF-EBCDIC.  The UTF-EBCDIC encoding is limited to code points no larger than 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Infinite recursion in regex</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used a pattern that references itself without consuming any input text.  You should check the pattern to ensure that recursive patterns either consume text or fail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Initialization of state variables in list context currently forbidden</dt>
<dd>
(F) Currently the implementation of &quot;state&quot; only permits the initialization of scalar variables in scalar context.  Re-write &quot;state ($a) = 42&quot; as &quot;state $a = 42&quot; to change from list to scalar context.  Constructions such as &quot;state (@a) = foo()&quot; will be supported in a future perl release.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%%s[%s] in scalar context better written as $%s[%s]</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) In scalar context, you've used an array index/value slice (indicated by %) to select a single element of an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $).  The difference is that $foo[&amp;bar] always behaves like a scalar, both in the value it returns and when evaluating its argument, while %foo[&amp;bar] provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things if you're expecting only one subscript.  When called in list context, it also returns the index (what &amp;bar returns) in addition to the value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%%s{%s} in scalar context better written as $%s{%s}</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) In scalar context, you've used a hash key/value slice (indicated by %) to select a single element of a hash.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $).  The difference is that $foo{&amp;bar} always behaves like a scalar, both in the value it returns and when evaluating its argument, while @foo{&amp;bar} and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things if you're expecting only one subscript.  When called in list context, it also returns the key in addition to the value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Insecure dependency in %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like. The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or setgid, or when you specify  <b>-T</b> to turn it on explicitly.  The tainting mechanism labels all data that's derived directly or indirectly from the user, who is considered to be unworthy of your trust.  If any such data is used in a &quot;dangerous&quot; operation, you get this error.  See perlsec for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Insecure directory in %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You can't use <i>system()</i>, <i>exec()</i>, or a piped open in a setuid or setgid script if $ENV{PATH} contains a directory that is writable by the world.  Also, the PATH must not contain any relative directory. See perlsec.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Insecure $ENV{%s} while running %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You can't use <i>system()</i>, <i>exec()</i>, or a piped open in a setuid or setgid script if any of $ENV{PATH}, $ENV{IFS}, $ENV{CDPATH}, $ENV{ENV}, $ENV{BASH_ENV} or $ENV{TERM} are derived from data supplied (or potentially supplied) by the user.  The script must set the path to a known value, using trustworthy data.  See perlsec.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Insecure user-defined property %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular expression that contains a call to a user-defined character property function, i.e. &quot;\p{IsFoo}&quot; or &quot;\p{InFoo}&quot;. See &quot;User-Defined Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode and perlsec.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
In '(?...)', splitting the initial '(?' is deprecated in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(D regexp, deprecated) The two-character sequence &quot;(?&quot; in this context in a regular expression pattern should be an indivisible token, with nothing intervening between the &quot;(&quot; and the &quot;?&quot;, but you separated them.  Due to an accident of implementation, this prohibition was not enforced, but we do plan to forbid it in a future Perl version.  This message serves as giving you fair warning of this pending change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Integer overflow in format string for %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) The indexes and widths specified in the format string of &quot;printf()&quot; or &quot;sprintf()&quot; are too large.  The numbers must not overflow the size of integers for your architecture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Integer overflow in %s number</dt>
<dd>
(S overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified either as a literal or as an argument to  <i>hex()</i> or <i>oct()</i> is too big for your architecture, and has been converted to a floating point number. On a 32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation internally--subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent operations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Integer overflow in srand</dt>
<dd>
(S overflow) The number you have passed to srand is too big to fit in your architecture's integer representation.  The number has been replaced with the largest integer supported (0xFFFFFFFF on 32-bit architectures).  This means you may be getting less randomness than you expect, because different random seeds above the maximum will return the same sequence of random numbers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Integer overflow in version</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Integer overflow in version %d</dt>
<dd>
(W overflow) Some portion of a version initialization is too large for the size of integers for your architecture.  This is not a warning because there is no rational reason for a version to try and use an element larger than typically 2**32.  This is usually caused by trying to use some odd mathematical operation as a version, like 100/9.</dd>

Internal disaster in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(P) Something went badly wrong in the regular expression parser. The &lt;--&#160;HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks</dt>
<dd>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl keeps track of the number of times you've called &quot;fork&quot; and &quot;exec&quot;, to determine whether the current call to &quot;exec&quot; should affect the current script or a subprocess (see &quot;exec LIST&quot; in perlvms).  Somehow, this count has become scrambled, so Perl is making a guess and treating this &quot;exec&quot; as a request to terminate the Perl script and execute the specified command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
internal %&lt;num&gt;p might conflict with future printf extensions</dt>
<dd>
(S internal) Perl's internal routine that handles &quot;printf&quot; and &quot;sprintf&quot; formatting follows a slightly different set of rules when called from C or XS code.  Specifically, formats consisting of digits followed by &quot;p&quot; (e.g., &quot;%7p&quot;) are reserved for future use.  If you see this message, then an XS module tried to call that routine with one such reserved format.</dd>

<dt>
%s (...) interpreted as function</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) You've run afoul of the rule that says that any list operator followed by parentheses turns into a function, with all the list operators arguments found inside the parentheses.  See &quot;Terms and List Operators (Leftward)&quot; in perlop.</dd>

Invalid character in charnames alias definition; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in '%s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to create a custom alias for a character name, with the &quot;:alias&quot; option to &quot;use charnames&quot; and the specified character in the indicated name isn't valid.  See &quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in charnames.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Invalid \0 character in %s for %s: %s\0%s</dt>
<dd>
(W syscalls) Embedded \0 characters in pathnames or other system call arguments produce a warning as of 5.20.  The parts after the \0 were formerly ignored by system calls.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Invalid character in \N{...}; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in \N{%s}</dt>

Invalid escape in the specified encoding in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(W regexp)(F) The numeric escape (for example &quot;\xHH&quot;) of value &lt; 256 didn't correspond to a single character through the conversion from the encoding specified by the encoding pragma. The escape was replaced with REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD) instead, except within &quot;(?[&#160;&#160;&#160;])&quot;, where it is a fatal error. The &lt;--&#160;HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the escape was discovered.</dd>

(F) The character constant represented by &quot;...&quot; is not a valid hexadecimal number.  Either it is empty, or you tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or A - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Invalid module name %s with -%c option: contains single ':'</dt>
<dd>
(F) The module argument to perl's <b>-m</b> and <b>-M</b> command-line options cannot contain single colons in the module name, but only in the arguments after &quot;=&quot;.  In other words,  <b>-MFoo::Bar=:baz</b> is ok, but  <b>-MFoo:Bar=baz</b> is not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Invalid mro name: '%s'</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to &quot;mro::set_mro(&quot;classname&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;)&quot; or &quot;use mro 'foo'&quot;, where &quot;foo&quot; is not a valid method resolution order (MRO).  Currently, the only valid ones supported are &quot;dfs&quot; and &quot;c3&quot;, unless you have loaded a module that is a MRO plugin.  See mro and perlmroapi.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Invalid negative number (%s) in chr</dt>

<dt>
Invalid separator character %s in PerlIO layer specification %s</dt>
<dd>
(W layer) When pushing layers onto the Perl I/O system, something other than a colon or whitespace was seen between the elements of a layer list. If the previous attribute had a parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that list was terminated too soon.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
Invalid strict version format (%s)</dt>
<dd>
(F) A version number did not meet the &quot;strict&quot; criteria for versions. A &quot;strict&quot; version number is a positive decimal number (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal v-string with a leading 'v' character and at least three components. The parenthesized text indicates which criteria were not met. See the version module for more details on allowed version formats.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Invalid version format (%s)</dt>
<dd>
(F) A version number did not meet the &quot;lax&quot; criteria for versions. A &quot;lax&quot; version number is a positive decimal number (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal v-string.  If the v-string has fewer than three components, it must have a leading 'v' character.  Otherwise, the leading 'v' is optional.  Both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a trailing &quot;alpha&quot; component separated by an underscore character after a fractional or dotted-decimal component.  The parenthesized text indicates which criteria were not met.  See the version module for more details on allowed version formats.</dd>

$* is no longer supported</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated, syntax) The special variable $*, deprecated in older perls, has been removed as of 5.10.0 and is no longer supported.  In previous versions of perl the use of $* enabled or disabled multi-line matching within a string.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Instead of using $* you should use the &quot;/m&quot; (and maybe &quot;/s&quot;) regexp modifiers.  You can enable &quot;/m&quot; for a lexical scope (even a whole file) with &quot;use re '/m'&quot;.

(S inplace) The &quot;-i&quot; option was passed on the command line, indicating that the script is intended to edit files in place, but no files were given.  This is usually a mistake, since editing STDIN in place doesn't make sense, and can be confusing because it can make perl look like it is hanging when it is really just trying to read from STDIN.  You should either pass a filename to edit, or remove &quot;-i&quot; from the command line.  See perlrun for more details.</dd>

(W imprecision) The value you attempted to increment or decrement by one is too large for the underlying floating point representation to store accurately, hence the target of &quot;++&quot; or &quot;--&quot; is unchanged.

Malformed prototype for %s: %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to use a function with a malformed prototype.  The syntax of function prototypes is given a brief compile-time check for obvious errors like invalid characters.  A more rigorous check is run when the function is called. Perhaps the function's author was trying to write a subroutine signature but didn't enable that feature first (&quot;use feature 'signatures'&quot;), so the signature was instead interpreted as a bad prototype.</dd>

Malformed UTF-8 character (%s)</dt>
<dd>
(S utf8)(F) Perl detected a string that didn't comply with UTF-8 encoding rules, even though it had the UTF8 flag on.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
One possible cause is that you set the UTF8 flag yourself for data that you thought to be in UTF-8 but it wasn't (it was for example legacy 8-bit data).  To guard against this, you can use Encode::decode_utf8.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you use the &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot; PerlIO layer for input, invalid byte sequences are handled gracefully, but if you use &quot;:utf8&quot;, the flag is set without validating the data, possibly resulting in this error message.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Mandatory parameter follows optional parameter</dt>
<dd>
(F) In a subroutine signature, you wrote something like &quot;$a = undef, $b&quot;, making an earlier parameter optional and a later one mandatory. Parameters are filled from left to right, so it's impossible for the caller to omit an earlier one and pass a later one.  If you want to act as if the parameters are filled from right to left, declare the rightmost optional and then shuffle the parameters around in the subroutine's body.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Matched non-Unicode code point 0x%X against Unicode property; may not be portable</dt>
<dd>
(S non_unicode) Perl allows strings to contain a superset of Unicode code points; each code point may be as large as what is storable in an unsigned integer on your system, but these may not be accepted by other languages/systems.  This message occurs when you matched a string containing such a code point against a regular expression pattern, and the code point was matched against a Unicode property, &quot;\p{...}&quot; or &quot;\P{...}&quot;.  Unicode properties are only defined on Unicode code points, so the result of this match is undefined by Unicode, but Perl (starting in v5.20) treats non-Unicode code points as if they were typical unassigned Unicode ones, and matched this one accordingly.  Whether a given property matches these code points or not is specified in &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This message is suppressed (unless it has been made fatal) if it is immaterial to the results of the match if the code point is Unicode or not.  For example, the property &quot;\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit}&quot; only can match the 22 characters &quot;[0-9A-Fa-f]&quot;, so obviously all other code points, Unicode or not, won't match it.  (And &quot;\P{ASCII_Hex_Digit}&quot; will match every code point except these 22.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Getting this message indicates that the outcome of the match arguably should have been the opposite of what actually happened.  If you think that is the case, you may wish to make the &quot;non_unicode&quot; warnings category fatal; if you agree with Perl's decision, you may wish to turn off this category.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dl>
<dt>
Missing right brace on \N{} or unescaped left brace after \N</dt>
<dd>
(F) &quot;\N&quot; has two meanings.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in braces, meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that name.  Thus &quot;\N{ASTERISK}&quot; is another way of writing &quot;*&quot;, valid in both double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns.  In patterns, it doesn't have the meaning an unescaped &quot;*&quot; does.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Starting in Perl 5.12.0, &quot;\N&quot; also can have an additional meaning (only) in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character.  (This is short for &quot;[^\n]&quot;, and like &quot;.&quot; but is not affected by the &quot;/s&quot; regex modifier.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This can lead to some ambiguities.  When &quot;\N&quot; is not followed immediately by a left brace, Perl assumes the &quot;[^\n]&quot; meaning.  Also, if the braces form a valid quantifier such as &quot;\N{3}&quot; or &quot;\N{5,}&quot;, Perl assumes that this means to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples, 3; and 5 or more, respectively).  In all other case, where there is a &quot;\N{&quot; and a matching &quot;}&quot;, Perl assumes that a character name is desired.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
However, if there is no matching &quot;}&quot;, Perl doesn't know if it was mistakenly omitted, or if &quot;[^\n]{&quot; was desired, and raises this error. If you meant the former, add the right brace; if you meant the latter, escape the brace with a backslash, like so: &quot;\N\{&quot;</dd>
</dl>

Missing right curly or square bracket</dt>

<dt>
(Missing semicolon on previous line?)</dt>
<dd>
(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;.  Don't automatically put a semicolon on the previous line just because you saw this message.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Modification of a read-only value attempted</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a constant.  You didn't, of course, try &quot;2 = 1&quot;, because the compiler catches that.  But an easy way to do the same thing is:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub mod { $_[0] = 1 }<br/>
    mod(2);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Another way is to assign to a <i>substr()</i> that's off the end of the string.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Yet another way is to assign to a &quot;foreach&quot; loop <i>VAR</i> when <i>VAR</i> is aliased to a constant in the look  <i>LIST</i>:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $x = 1;<br/>
    foreach my $n ($x, 2) {<br/>

mprotect RW for %p %u failed with %d</dt>
<dd>
(S) You compiled perl with <b>-D</b>PERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS (see perlhacktips), but a read-only op tree could not be made mutable before freeing the ops.</dd>

(W syntax) Multidimensional arrays aren't written like $foo[1,2,3]. They're written like $foo[1][2][3], as in C.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
'/' must follow a numeric type in unpack</dt>
<dd>
(F) You had an unpack template that contained a '/', but this did not follow some unpack specification producing a numeric value. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;my sub&quot; not yet implemented</dt>

(F) Lexically scoped subroutines are not yet implemented.  Don't try that yet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;my %s&quot; used in sort comparison</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) The package variables $a and $b are used for sort comparisons. You used $a or $b in as an operand to the &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot; or &quot;cmp&quot; operator inside a sort comparison block, and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.  Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the lexical variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;my&quot; variable %s can't be in a package</dt>
<dd>
(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use  <i>local()</i> if you want to localize a package variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Name &quot;%s::%s&quot; used only once: possible typo</dt>
<dd>
(W once) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable names.  If you had a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention it again somehow to suppress the message.  The &quot;our&quot; declaration is also provided for this purpose.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
NOTE: This warning detects package symbols that have been used only once. This means lexical variables will never trigger this warning. It also means that all of the package variables $c, @c, %c, as well as *c, &amp;c, sub c{}, c(), and c (the filehandle or format) are considered the same; if a program uses $c only once but also uses any of the others it will not trigger this warning. Symbols beginning with an underscore and symbols using special identifiers (q.v. perldata) are exempt from this warning.</dd>

Need exactly 3 octal digits in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) Within &quot;(?[&#160;&#160;&#160;])&quot;, all constants interpreted as octal need to be exactly 3 digits long.  This helps catch some ambiguities.  If your constant is too short, add leading zeros, like<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 (?[ [ \078 ] ])     # Syntax error!<br/>
 (?[ [ \0078 ] ])    # Works<br/>
 (?[ [ \007 8 ] ])   # Clearer<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The maximum number this construct can express is &quot;\777&quot;.  If you need a larger one, you need to use \o{} instead.  If you meant two separate things, you need to separate them:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 (?[ [ \7776 ] ])        # Syntax error!<br/>
 (?[ [ \o{7776} ] ])     # One meaning<br/>

Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parentheses. So things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal.  The &lt;--&#160;HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that the minimal matching quantifiers, &quot;*?&quot;, &quot;+?&quot;, and &quot;??&quot; appear to be nested quantifiers, but aren't.  See perlre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s never introduced</dt>
<dd>
(S internal) The symbol in question was declared but somehow went out of scope before it could possibly have been used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
next::method/next::can/maybe::next::method cannot find enclosing method</dt>
<dd>
(F) &quot;next::method&quot; needs to be called within the context of a real method in a real package, and it could not find such a context. See mro.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
\N in a character class must be a named character: \N{...} in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) The new (as of Perl 5.12) meaning of &quot;\N&quot; as &quot;[^\n]&quot; is not valid in a bracketed character class, for the same reason that &quot;.&quot; in a character class loses its specialness: it matches almost everything, which is probably not what you want.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
\N{} in character class restricted to one character in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) Named Unicode character escapes (&quot;\N{...}&quot;) may return a multi-character sequence.  Such an escape may not be used in a character class, because character classes always match one character of input.  Check that the correct escape has been used, and the correct charname handler is in scope.  The &lt;--&#160;HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
\N{NAME} must be resolved by the lexer in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) When compiling a regex pattern, an unresolved named character or sequence was encountered.  This can happen in any of several ways that bypass the lexer, such as using single-quotish context, or an extra backslash in double-quotish:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $re = '\N{SPACE}';  # Wrong!<br/>
    $re = &quot;\\N{SPACE}&quot;; # Wrong!<br/>
    /$re/;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Instead, use double-quotes with a single backslash:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $re = &quot;\N{SPACE}&quot;;  # ok<br/>
    /$re/;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The lexer can be bypassed as well by creating the pattern from smaller components:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $re = '\N';<br/>
    /${re}{SPACE}/;     # Wrong!<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It's not a good idea to split a construct in the middle like this, and it doesn't work here.  Instead use the solution above.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Finally, the message also can happen under the &quot;/x&quot; regex modifier when the &quot;\N&quot; is separated by spaces from the &quot;{&quot;, in which case, remove the spaces.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    /\N {SPACE}/x;      # Wrong!<br/>
    /\N{SPACE}/x;       # ok<br/>
</dd>

<dt>
No %s allowed while running setuid</dt>
<dd>
(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or setgid script to even be allowed to attempt.  Generally speaking there will be another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least securable.  See perlsec.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No code specified for -%c</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl's <b>-e</b> and <b>-E</b> command-line options require an argument.  If you want to run an empty program, pass the empty string as a separate argument or run a program consisting of a single 0 or 1:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -e &quot;&quot;<br/>
    perl -e0<br/>
    perl -e1<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No comma allowed after %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or &quot;indirect object&quot; is not allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments. Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported a constant to your name space with  <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> while no such importing took place, it may for example be that your operating system does not support that particular constant.  Hopefully you did use an explicit import list for the constants you expect to see; please see &quot;use&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;import&quot; in perlfunc.  While an explicit import list would probably have caught this error earlier it naturally does not remedy the fact that your operating system still does not support that constant.  Maybe you have a typo in the constants of the symbol import list of  <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> or in the constant name at the line where this error was triggered?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No command into which to pipe on command line</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection, and found a '|' at the end of the command line, so it doesn't know where you want to pipe the output from this command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No DB::DB routine defined</dt>
<dd>
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch, but for some reason the current debugger (e.g.  <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a &quot;Devel::&quot; module) didn't define a routine to be called at the beginning of each statement.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No dbm on this machine</dt>
<dd>
(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should supply dbm nowadays, because Perl comes with SDBM.  See SDBM_File.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No DB::sub routine defined</dt>
<dd>
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch, but for some reason the current debugger (e.g.  <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a &quot;Devel::&quot; module) didn't define a &quot;DB::sub&quot; routine to be called at the beginning of each ordinary subroutine call.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No directory specified for -I</dt>
<dd>
(F) The <b>-I</b> command-line switch requires a directory name as part of the  <i>same</i> argument.  Use <b>-Ilib</b>, for instance.  <b>-I lib</b> won't work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No error file after 2&gt; or 2&gt;&gt; on command line</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection, and found a '2&gt;' or a '2&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but can't find the name of the file to which to write data destined for stderr.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No group ending character '%c' found in template</dt>
<dd>
(F) A pack or unpack template has an opening '(' or '[' without its matching counterpart.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No input file after &lt; on command line</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection, and found a '&lt;' on the command line, but can't find the name of the file from which to read data for stdin.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No next::method '%s' found for %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) &quot;next::method&quot; found no further instances of this method name in the remaining packages of the MRO of this class.  If you don't want it throwing an exception, use &quot;maybe::next::method&quot; or &quot;next::can&quot;.  See mro.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Non-hex character in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>

 (?[ [ \x{DEKA} ] ])<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Non-octal character in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) In a regular expression, there was a non-octal character where an octal one was expected, like<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 (?[ [ \o{1278} ] ])<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Non-octal character '%c'.  Resolved as &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(W digit) In parsing an octal numeric constant, a character was unexpectedly encountered that isn't octal.  The resulting value is as indicated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;no&quot; not allowed in expression</dt>
<dd>
(F) The &quot;no&quot; keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and returns no useful value.  See perlmod.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Non-string passed as bitmask</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) A number has been passed as a bitmask argument to <i>select()</i>. Use the  <i>vec()</i> function to construct the file descriptor bitmasks for select.  See &quot;select&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No output file after &gt; on command line</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection, and found a lone '&gt;' at the end of the command line, so it doesn't know where you wanted to redirect stdout.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No output file after &gt; or &gt;&gt; on command line</dt>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection, and found a '&gt;' or a '&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but can't find the name of the file to which to write data destined for stdout.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No package name allowed for variable %s in &quot;our&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) Fully qualified variable names are not allowed in &quot;our&quot; declarations, because that doesn't make much sense under existing semantics.  Such syntax is reserved for future extensions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No Perl script found in input</dt>
<dd>
(F) You called &quot;perl -x&quot;, but no line was found in the file beginning with #! and containing the word &quot;perl&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No setregid available</dt>
<dd>
(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the <i>setregid()</i> call for your system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No setreuid available</dt>
<dd>
(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the <i>setreuid()</i> call for your system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No such class %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You provided a class qualifier in a &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; declaration, but this class doesn't exist at this point in your program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No such class field &quot;%s&quot; in variable %s of type %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to access a key from a hash through the indicated typed variable but that key is not allowed by the package of the same type. The indicated package has restricted the set of allowed keys using the fields pragma.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No such hook: %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You specified a signal hook that was not recognized by Perl. Currently, Perl accepts &quot;__DIE__&quot; and &quot;__WARN__&quot; as valid signal hooks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No such pipe open</dt>
<dd>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The internal routine <i>my_pclose()</i> tried to close a pipe which hadn't been opened.  This should have been caught earlier as an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No such signal: SIG%s</dt>
<dd>
(W signal) You specified a signal name as a subscript to %SIG that was not recognized.  Say &quot;kill -l&quot; in your shell to see the valid signal names on your system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Not a CODE reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can use the  <i>ref()</i> function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See also perlref.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Not a GLOB reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a &quot;typeglob&quot; (that is, a symbol table entry that looks like *foo), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can use the  <i>ref()</i> function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See perlref.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Not a HASH reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a hash value, but found a reference to something else instead.  You can use the  <i>ref()</i> function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See perlref.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Not an ARRAY reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to an array value, but found a reference to something else instead.  You can use the  <i>ref()</i> function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See perlref.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Not an unblessed ARRAY reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) You passed a reference to a blessed array to &quot;push&quot;, &quot;shift&quot; or another array function.  These only accept unblessed array references or arrays beginning explicitly with &quot;@&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Not a SCALAR reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a scalar value, but found a reference to something else instead.  You can use the  <i>ref()</i> function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See perlref.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Not a subroutine reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can use the  <i>ref()</i> function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See also perlref.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Not a subroutine reference in overload table</dt>
<dd>
(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an overloading table that doesn't somehow point to a valid subroutine.  See overload.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Not enough arguments for %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) The function requires more arguments than you specified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Not enough format arguments</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) A format specified more picture fields than the next line supplied.  See perlform.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s: not found</dt>
<dd>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell instead of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
(?[...]) not valid in locale in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) &quot;(?[...])&quot; cannot be used within the scope of a &quot;use&#160;locale&quot; or with an &quot;/l&quot; regular expression modifier, as that would require deferring to run-time the calculation of what it should evaluate to, and it is regex compile-time only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC</dt>
<dd>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl was unable to find the local timezone offset, so it's assuming that local system time is equivalent to UTC.  If it's not, define the logical name  <i>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</i> to translate to the number of seconds which need to be added to UTC to get local time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Null filename used</dt>
<dd>
(F) You can't require the null filename, especially because on many machines that means the current directory!  See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
NULL OP IN RUN</dt>
<dd>
(S debugging) Some internal routine called <i>run()</i> with a null opcode pointer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Null picture in formline</dt>
<dd>
(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format picture specification.  It was found to be empty, which probably means you supplied it an uninitialized value.  See perlform.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Null realloc</dt>
<dd>
(P) An attempt was made to realloc NULL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
NULL regexp argument</dt>
<dd>
(P) The internal pattern matching routines blew it big time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
NULL regexp parameter</dt>
<dd>
(P) The internal pattern matching routines are out of their gourd.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Number too long</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in programs to about 250 characters.  You've exceeded that length.  Future versions of Perl are likely to eliminate this arbitrary limitation.  In the meantime, try using scientific notation (e.g. &quot;1e6&quot; instead of &quot;1_000_000&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Number with no digits</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl was looking for a number but found nothing that looked like a number.  This happens, for example with &quot;\o{}&quot;, with no number between the braces.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Octal number &gt; 037777777777 non-portable</dt>
<dd>
(W portable) The octal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1 (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See perlport for more on portability concerns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Odd name/value argument for subroutine</dt>
<dd>
(F) A subroutine using a slurpy hash parameter in its signature received an odd number of arguments to populate the hash.  It requires the arguments to be paired, with the same number of keys as values. The caller of the subroutine is presumably at fault.  Inconveniently, this error will be reported at the location of the subroutine, not that of the caller.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Odd number of arguments for overload::constant</dt>
<dd>
(W overload) The call to overload::constant contained an odd number of arguments.  The arguments should come in pairs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Odd number of elements in anonymous hash</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash, which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Odd number of elements in hash assignment</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash, which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Offset outside string</dt>
<dd>
(F)(W layer) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv/seek operation with an offset pointing outside the buffer.  This is difficult to imagine.  The sole exceptions to this are that zero padding will take place when going past the end of the string when either &quot;sysread()&quot;ing a file, or when seeking past the end of a scalar opened for I/O (in anticipation of future reads and to imitate the behaviour with real files).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s() on unopened %s</dt>
<dd>
(W unopened) An I/O operation was attempted on a filehandle that was never initialized.  You need to do an  <i>open()</i>, a <i>sysopen()</i>, or a <i>socket()</i> call, or call a constructor from the FileHandle package.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
-%s on unopened filehandle %s</dt>
<dd>
(W unopened) You tried to invoke a file test operator on a filehandle that isn't open.  Check your control flow.  See also &quot;-X&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
oops: oopsAV</dt>

<dd>
(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Opening dirhandle %s also as a file</dt>
<dd>
(D io, deprecated) You used <i>open()</i> to associate a filehandle to a symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a dirhandle. Although legal, this idiom might render your code confusing and is deprecated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Opening filehandle %s also as a directory</dt>
<dd>
(D io, deprecated) You used <i>opendir()</i> to associate a dirhandle to a symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a filehandle. Although legal, this idiom might render your code confusing and is deprecated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Operand with no preceding operator in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>

<br/>
 (?[ \p{Digit} \p{Thai} ])<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

There are two operands, but no operator giving how you want to combine them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Operation &quot;%s&quot;: no method found, %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for which no handler was defined.  While some handlers can be autogenerated in terms of other handlers, there is no default handler for any operation, unless the &quot;fallback&quot; overloading key is specified to be true.  See overload.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
Operation &quot;%s&quot; returns its argument for non-Unicode code point 0x%X</dt>
<dd>
(S non_unicode) You performed an operation requiring Unicode semantics on a code point that is not in Unicode, so what it should do is not defined.  Perl has chosen to have it do nothing, and warn you.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by &quot;no warnings 'non_unicode';&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Operation &quot;%s&quot; returns its argument for UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</dt>
<dd>
(S surrogate) You performed an operation requiring Unicode semantics on a Unicode surrogate.  Unicode frowns upon the use of surrogates for anything but storing strings in UTF-16, but semantics are (reluctantly) defined for the surrogates, and they are to do nothing for this operation.  Because the use of surrogates can be dangerous, Perl warns.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by &quot;no warnings 'surrogate';&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Operator or semicolon missing before %s</dt>
<dd>
(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser was expecting an operator.  The parser has assumed you really meant to use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect.  For example, if you say &quot;*foo *foo&quot; it will be interpreted as if you said &quot;*foo * 'foo'&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Optional parameter lacks default expression</dt>
<dd>
(F) In a subroutine signature, you wrote something like &quot;$a =&quot;, making a named optional parameter without a default value.  A nameless optional parameter is permitted to have no default value, but a named one must have a specific default.  You probably want &quot;$a = undef&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;our&quot; variable %s redeclared</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) You seem to have already declared the same global once before in the current lexical scope.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Out of memory!</dt>
<dd>
(X) The <i>malloc()</i> function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  Perl has no option but to exit immediately.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
At least in Unix you may be able to get past this by increasing your process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use &quot;limit&quot; and &quot;limit datasize n&quot; (where &quot;n&quot; is the number of kilobytes) to check the current limits and change them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use &quot;ulimit -a&quot; and &quot;ulimit -d n&quot;, respectively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Out of memory during %s extend</dt>
<dd>
(X) An attempt was made to extend an array, a list, or a string beyond the largest possible memory allocation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Out of memory during &quot;large&quot; request for %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) The <i>malloc()</i> function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  However, the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is 64K), so a possibility to shut down by trapping this error is granted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Out of memory during request for %s</dt>
<dd>
(X)(F) The <i>malloc()</i> function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it depends on the way perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable. However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of $^M as an emergency pool after  <i>die()</i>ing with this message.  In this case the error is trappable  <i>once</i>, and the error message will include the line and file where the failed request happened.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Out of memory during ridiculously large request</dt>
<dd>
(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes.  This error is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g., $arr[time] instead of $arr[$time].</dd>
</dl>

(D deprecated, utf8) This message indicates a bug either in the Perl core or in XS code.  Such code was trying to find out if a character, allegedly stored internally encoded as UTF-8, was of a given type, such as being punctuation or a digit.  But the character was not encoded in legal UTF-8.  The %s is replaced by a string that can be used by knowledgeable people to determine what the type being checked against was.

Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies.  In the above the settings were that the LC_ALL was &quot;En_US&quot; and the LANG had no value. This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your operating system supplier and/or system administrator have set up the so-called locale system but Perl could not use those settings.  This was not dead serious, fortunately: there is a &quot;default locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot; that Perl can and will use, and the script will be run.

(F) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with &quot;[=&quot; and ending with &quot;=]&quot; is reserved for future extensions.  If you need to represent those character sequences inside a regular expression character class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash: &quot;\[=&quot; and &quot;=\]&quot;.

Possible attempt to put comments in <i>qw()</i> list</dt>
<dd>
(W qw) <i>qw()</i> lists contain items separated by whitespace; as with literal strings, comment characters are not ignored, but are instead treated as literal data.  (You may have used different delimiters than the parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently used.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You probably wrote something like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    @list = qw(<br/>
        a # a comment<br/>
        b # another comment<br/>
    );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
when you should have written this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    @list = qw(<br/>
        a<br/>
        b<br/>
    );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

If you really want comments, build your list the old-fashioned way, with quotes and commas:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    @list = (<br/>
        'a',    # a comment<br/>

Possible attempt to separate words with commas</dt>
<dd>
(W qw) <i>qw()</i> lists contain items separated by whitespace; therefore commas aren't needed to separate the items.  (You may have used different delimiters than the parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently used.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You probably wrote something like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    qw! a, b, c !;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
which puts literal commas into some of the list items.  Write it without commas if you don't want them to appear in your data:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Possible memory corruption: %s overflowed 3rd argument</dt>
<dd>
(F) An <i>ioctl()</i> or <i>fcntl()</i> returned more than Perl was bargaining for. Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the end of the buffer just in case.  This sentinel byte got clobbered, and Perl assumes that memory is now corrupted.  See &quot;ioctl&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>

<dt>
Possible precedence issue with control flow operator</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) There is a possible problem with the mixing of a control flow operator (e.g. &quot;return&quot;) and a low-precedence operator like &quot;or&quot;.  Consider:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { return $a or $b; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is parsed as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { (return $a) or $b; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Which is effectively just:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { return $a; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Either use parentheses or the high-precedence variant of the operator.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note this may be also triggered for constructs like:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { 1 if die; }<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Possible precedence problem on bitwise %c operator</dt>
<dd>
(W precedence) Your program uses a bitwise logical operator in conjunction with a numeric comparison operator, like this :<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    if ($x &amp; $y == 0) { ... }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This expression is actually equivalent to &quot;$x &amp; ($y == 0)&quot;, due to the higher precedence of &quot;==&quot;.  This is probably not what you want.  (If you really meant to write this, disable the warning, or, better, put the parentheses explicitly and write &quot;$x &amp; ($y == 0)&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Possible unintended interpolation of $\ in regex</dt>
<dd>
(W ambiguous) You said something like &quot;m/$\/&quot; in a regex. The regex &quot;m/foo$\s+bar/m&quot; translates to: match the word 'foo', the output record separator (see &quot;$\&quot; in perlvar) and the letter 's' (one time or more) followed by the word 'bar'.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If this is what you intended then you can silence the warning by using &quot;m/${\}/&quot; (for example: &quot;m/foo${\}s+bar/&quot;).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If instead you intended to match the word 'foo' at the end of the line followed by whitespace and the word 'bar' on the next line then you can use &quot;m/$(?)\/&quot; (for example: &quot;m/foo$(?)\s+bar/&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Possible unintended interpolation of %s in string</dt>
<dd>
(W ambiguous) You said something like '@foo' in a double-quoted string but there was no array @foo in scope at the time.  If you wanted a literal @foo, then write it as \@foo; otherwise find out what happened to the array you apparently lost track of.</dd>

Precedence problem: open %s should be open(%s)</dt>
<dd>
(S precedence) The old irregular construct<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div style="height: 1.00em;">

&#160;</div>
<br/>
    open(FOO || die);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
because of the strict regularization of Perl 5's grammar into unary and list operators.  (The old open was a little of both.)  You must put parentheses around the filehandle, or use the new &quot;or&quot; operator instead of &quot;||&quot;.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
\p{} uses Unicode rules, not locale rules</dt>
<dd>
(W) You compiled a regular expression that contained a Unicode property match (&quot;\p&quot; or &quot;\P&quot;), but the regular expression is also being told to use the run-time locale, not Unicode.  Instead, use a POSIX character class, which should know about the locale's rules. (See &quot;POSIX Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Even if the run-time locale is ISO 8859-1 (Latin1), which is a subset of Unicode, some properties will give results that are not valid for that subset.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Here are a couple of examples to help you see what's going on.  If the locale is ISO 8859-7, the character at code point 0xD7 is the &quot;GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI&quot;.  But in Unicode that code point means the &quot;MULTIPLICATION SIGN&quot; instead, and &quot;\p&quot; always uses the Unicode meaning.  That means that &quot;\p{Alpha}&quot; won't match, but &quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot; should.  Only in the Latin1 locale are all the characters in the same positions as they are in Unicode.  But, even here, some properties give incorrect results.  An example is &quot;\p{Changes_When_Uppercased}&quot; which is true for &quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS&quot;, but since the upper case of that character is not in Latin1, in that locale it doesn't change when upper cased.</dd>

<dt>
Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a single element of an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $).  The difference is that $foo[&amp;bar] always behaves like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while @foo[&amp;bar] behaves like a list when you assign to it, and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things if you're expecting only one subscript.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Note that since Perl 5.10.0 a // can also be the <i>defined-or</i> construct, not just the empty search pattern.  Therefore code written in Perl 5.10.0 or later that uses the // as the  <i>defined-or</i> can be misparsed by pre-5.10.0 Perls as a non-terminated search pattern.</dd>

Server error (a.k.a. &quot;500 Server error&quot;)</dt>
<dd>
(A) This is the error message generally seen in a browser window when trying to run a CGI program (including SSI) over the web.  The actual error text varies widely from server to server.  The most frequently-seen variants are &quot;500 Server error&quot;, &quot;Method (something) not permitted&quot;, &quot;Document contains no data&quot;, &quot;Premature end of script headers&quot;, and &quot;Did not produce a valid header&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>This is a CGI error, not a Perl error</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You need to make sure your script is executable, is accessible by the user CGI is running the script under (which is probably not the user account you tested it under), does not rely on any environment variables (like PATH) from the user it isn't running under, and isn't in a location where the CGI server can't find it, basically, more or less.  Please see the following for more information:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Setting $/ to a reference to %s as a form of slurp is deprecated, treating as undef</dt>
<dd>
(W deprecated) You assigned a reference to a scalar to $/ where the referenced item is not a positive integer.  In older perls this  <b>appeared</b> to work the same as setting it to &quot;undef&quot; but was in fact internally different, less efficient and with very bad luck could have resulted in your file being split by a stringified form of the reference.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In Perl 5.20.0 this was changed so that it would be <b>exactly</b> the same as setting $/ to undef, with the exception that this warning would be thrown.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You are recommended to change your code to set $/ to &quot;undef&quot; explicitly if you wish to slurp the file. In future versions of Perl assigning a reference to will throw a fatal error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Setting $/ to %s reference is forbidden</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to assign a reference to a non integer to $/.  In older Perls this would have behaved similarly to setting it to a reference to a positive integer, where the integer was the address of the reference.

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Subroutine &quot;&amp;%s&quot; is not available</dt>
<dd>
(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently available.  This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the lexical subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.  (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.)  For example,<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \&amp;a } }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current &quot;a&quot; sub, since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.  Conversely, the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { my sub a {...} eval 'sub f { \&amp;a }' }-&gt;();<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a lexical subroutine that has gone out of scope, for example,<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub f {<br/>
        my sub a {...}<br/>
        sub { eval '\&amp;a' }<br/>
    }<br/>
    f()-&gt;();<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Here, when the '\&amp;a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being executed, so its &amp;a is not available for capture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;%s&quot; subroutine &amp;%s masks earlier declaration in same %s</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) A &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot; subroutine has been redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error. Note that the earlier subroutine will still exist until the end of the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Subroutine %s redefined</dt>
<dd>
(W redefine) You redefined a subroutine.  To suppress this warning, say<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    {<br/>
        no warnings 'redefine';<br/>

(W substr)(F) You tried to reference a <i>substr()</i> that pointed outside of a string.  That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger than the length of the string.

<dt>
syntax error</dt>
<dd>
(F) Probably means you had a syntax error.  Common reasons include:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    A keyword is misspelled.<br/>
    A semicolon is missing.<br/>
    A comma is missing.<br/>
    An opening or closing parenthesis is missing.<br/>
    An opening or closing brace is missing.<br/>
    A closing quote is missing.<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on  <b>-w</b>.) The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input. Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call &quot;perl -c&quot; repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20&#160;questions.</dd>

<dd>
(W internal) Warnings peculiar to VMS.  You tried to change or delete an element of the CRTL's internal environ array, but your copy of Perl wasn't built with a CRTL that contained the  <i>setenv()</i> function.  You'll need to rebuild Perl with a CRTL that does, or redefine  <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see perlvms) so that the environ array isn't the target of the change to %ENV which produced the warning.</dd>

This Perl has not been built with support for randomized hash key traversal but something called <i>Perl_hv_rand_set()</i>.</dt>
<dd>
(F) Something has attempted to use an internal API call which depends on Perl being compiled with the default support for randomized hash key traversal, but this Perl has been compiled without it.  You should report this warning to the relevant upstream party, or recompile perl with default options.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;-T&quot; is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line</dt>
<dd>
(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the  <b>-T</b> option (or the <b>-t</b> option), but Perl was not invoked with  <b>-T</b> in its command line.  This is an error because, by the time Perl discovers a  <b>-T</b> in a script, it's too late to properly taint everything from the environment.  So Perl gives up.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #! mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed by editing the #! line so that the  <b>-%c</b> option is a part of Perl's first argument: e.g. change &quot;perl -n -%c&quot; to &quot;perl -%c -n&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the Perl script is being executed as &quot;perl scriptname&quot;, then the  <b>-%c</b> option must appear on the command line: &quot;perl -%c scriptname&quot;.</dd>

<dt>
Too few arguments for subroutine</dt>
<dd>
(F) A subroutine using a signature received fewer arguments than required by the signature.  The caller of the subroutine is presumably at fault. Inconveniently, this error will be reported at the location of the subroutine, not that of the caller.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Too late for &quot;-%s&quot; option</dt>
<dd>
(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the  <b>-M</b>, <b>-m</b> or <b>-C</b> option.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In the case of <b>-M</b> and <b>-m</b>, this is an error because those options are not intended for use inside scripts.  Use the &quot;use&quot; pragma instead.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>-C</b> option only works if it is specified on the command line as well (with the same sequence of letters or numbers following).  Either specify this option on the command line, or, if your system supports it, make your script executable and run it directly instead of passing it to perl.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Too late to run %s block</dt>
<dd>
(W void) A CHECK or INIT block is being defined during run time proper, when the opportunity to run them has already passed.  Perhaps you are loading a file with &quot;require&quot; or &quot;do&quot; when you should be using &quot;use&quot; instead.  Or perhaps you should put the &quot;require&quot; or &quot;do&quot; inside a BEGIN block.</dd>

Type of arg %d to &amp;CORE::%s must be %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) The subroutine in question in the CORE package requires its argument to be a hard reference to data of the specified type.  Overloading is ignored, so a reference to an object that is not the specified type, but nonetheless has overloading to handle it, will still not be accepted.</dd>
</dl>

The &quot;)&quot; is out-of-place.  Something apparently was supposed to be combined with the digits, or the &quot;+&quot; shouldn't be there, or something like that.  Perl can't figure out what was intended.</dd>

<br/>
 (?[ \p{Digit} ( \p{Lao} + \p{Thai} ) ])<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dt>
Unicode non-character U+%X is illegal for open interchange</dt>
<dd>
(S nonchar) Certain codepoints, such as U+FFFE and U+FFFF, are defined by the Unicode standard to be non-characters.  Those are legal codepoints, but are reserved for internal use; so, applications shouldn't attempt to exchange them.  An application may not be expecting any of these characters at all, and receiving them may lead to bugs.  If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by &quot;no warnings 'nonchar';&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is not really a &quot;serious&quot; error, but it is supposed to be raised by default even if warnings are not enabled, and currently the only way to do that in Perl is to mark it as serious.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Unicode surrogate U+%X is illegal in UTF-8</dt>
<dd>
(S surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are not considered acceptable.  These code points, between U+D800 and U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16.  However, Perl internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit available on your platform), including surrogates.  But these can cause problems when being input or output, which is likely where this message came from.  If you really really know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by &quot;no warnings 'surrogate';&quot;.</dd>

(F) The name you used inside &quot;\N{}&quot; is unknown to Perl.  Check the spelling.  You can say &quot;use charnames &quot;:loose&quot;&quot; to not have to be so precise about spaces, hyphens, and capitalization on standard Unicode names.  (Any custom aliases that have been created must be specified exactly, regardless of whether &quot;:loose&quot; is used or not.)

(W layer) An attempt was made to push an unknown layer onto the Perl I/O system.  (Layers take care of transforming data between external and internal representations.)  Note that some layers, such as &quot;mmap&quot;, are not supported in all environments.  If your program didn't explicitly request the failing operation, it may be the result of the value of the environment variable PERLIO.</dd>

Unknown process %x sent message to prime_env_iter: %s</dt>
<dd>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl was reading values for %ENV before iterating over it, and someone else stuck a message in the stream of data Perl expected.  Someone's very confused, or perhaps trying to subvert Perl's population of %ENV for nefarious purposes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Unknown regex modifier &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) Alphanumerics immediately following the closing delimiter of a regular expression pattern are interpreted by Perl as modifier flags for the regex.  One of the ones you specified is invalid.  One way this can happen is if you didn't put in white space between the end of the regex and a following alphanumeric operator:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 if ($a =~ /foo/and $bar == 3) { ... }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The &quot;a&quot; is a valid modifier flag, but the &quot;n&quot; is not, and raises this error.  Likely what was meant instead was:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>

(F) Unbackslashed parentheses must always be balanced in regular expressions.  If you're a vi user, the % key is valuable for finding the matching parenthesis.  The &lt;--&#160;HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.  See perlre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Unmatched right %s bracket</dt>
<dd>
(F) The lexer counted more closing curly or square brackets than opening ones, so you're probably missing a matching opening bracket.  As a general rule, you'll find the missing one (so to speak) near the place you were last editing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Unquoted string &quot;%s&quot; may clash with future reserved word</dt>
<dd>
(W reserved) You used a bareword that might someday be claimed as a reserved word.  It's best to put such a word in quotes, or capitalize it somehow, or insert an underbar into it.  You might also declare it as a subroutine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Unrecognized character %s; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE after %s near column %d</dt>
<dd>
(F) The Perl parser has no idea what to do with the specified character in your Perl script (or eval) near the specified column.  Perhaps you tried  to run a compressed script, a binary program, or a directory as a Perl program.</dd>

<dt>
Unterminated &lt;&gt; operator</dt>
<dd>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in the line, and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</dd>

(W regexp) You have used an internal modifier such as (?-o) that has no meaning unless removed from the entire regexp:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    if ($string =~ /(?-o)$pattern/o) { ... }<br/>

The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.  See perlre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Useless localization of %s</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) The localization of lvalues such as &quot;local($x=10)&quot; is legal, but in fact the  <i>local()</i> currently has no effect.  This may change at some point in the future, but in the meantime such code is discouraged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Useless (?%s) - use /%s modifier in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(W regexp) You have used an internal modifier such as (?o) that has no meaning unless applied to the entire regexp:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Useless use of '\'; doesn't escape metacharacter '%c'</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You wrote a regular expression pattern something like one of these:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 m{ \x\{FF\} }x<br/>
 m{foo\{1,3\}}<br/>
 qr(foo\(bar\))<br/>
 s[foo\[a-z\]bar][baz]<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The interior braces, square brackets, and parentheses are treated as metacharacters even though they are backslashed; instead write:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 m{ \x{FF} }x<br/>
 m{foo{1,3}}<br/>
 qr(foo(bar))<br/>
 s[foo[a-z]bar][baz]<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The backslashes have no effect when a regular expression pattern is delimited by &quot;{}&quot;, &quot;[]&quot;, or &quot;()&quot;, which ordinarily are metacharacters, and the delimiters are also used, paired, within the interior of the pattern.  It is planned that a future Perl release will change the meaning of constructs like these so that the backslashes will have an effect, so remove them from your code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Useless use of \E</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) You have a \E in a double-quotish string without a &quot;\U&quot;, &quot;\L&quot; or &quot;\Q&quot; preceding it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Useless use of greediness modifier '%c' in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(W regexp) You specified something like these:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 qr/a{3}?/<br/>
 qr/b{1,1}+/<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The &quot;?&quot; and &quot;+&quot; don't have any effect, as they modify whether to match more or fewer when there is a choice, and by specifying to match exactly a given numer, there is no room left for a choice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Useless use of %s in void context</dt>
<dd>
(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to parse your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and said<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $one, $two = 1, 2;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
when you meant to say<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for example, if you say<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $array = (1,2);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
when you should have said<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $array = [1,2];<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value, while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See perlref for more on this.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This warning will not be issued for numerical constants equal to 0 or 1 since they are often used in statements like<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    1 while sub_with_side_effects();<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
String constants that would normally evaluate to 0 or 1 are warned about.</dd>

Useless use of (?-p) in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>

&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $x = sort @y;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

This is not very useful, and perl currently optimizes this away.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Useless use of %s with no values</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) You used the <i>push()</i> or <i>unshift()</i> function with no arguments apart from the array, like &quot;push(@x)&quot; or &quot;unshift(@foo)&quot;.  That won't usually have any effect on the array, so is completely useless.  It's possible in principle that push(@tied_array) could have some effect if the array is tied to a class which implements a PUSH method.  If so, you can write it as &quot;push(@tied_array,())&quot; to avoid this warning.</dd>

Use of chdir('') or chdir(undef) as <i>chdir()</i> deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) <i>chdir()</i> with no arguments is documented to change to $ENV{HOME} or $ENV{LOGDIR}.  chdir(undef) and chdir('') share this behavior, but that has been deprecated.  In future versions they will simply fail.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Use of /c modifier is meaningless without /g</dt>
<dd>
(W regexp) You used the /c modifier with a regex operand, but didn't use the /g modifier.  Currently, /c is meaningful only when /g is used.  (This may change in the future.)</dd>

<dt>
Use of comma-less variable list is deprecated</dt>

Use of <i>each()</i> on hash after insertion without resetting hash iterator results in undefined behavior</dt>
<dd>
(S internal) The behavior of &quot;each()&quot; after insertion is undefined; it may skip items, or visit items more than once.  Consider using &quot;keys()&quot; instead of &quot;each()&quot;.</dd>

Use of := for an empty attribute list is not allowed</dt>
<dd>
(F) The construction &quot;my $x := 42&quot; used to parse as equivalent to &quot;my $x : = 42&quot; (applying an empty attribute list to $x). This construct was deprecated in 5.12.0, and has now been made a syntax error, so &quot;:=&quot; can be reclaimed as a new operator in the future.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you need an empty attribute list, for example in a code generator, add a space before the &quot;=&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of freed value in iteration</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perhaps you modified the iterated array within the loop? This error is typically caused by code like the following:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    @a = (3,4);<br/>
    @a = () for (1,2,@a);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You are not supposed to modify arrays while they are being iterated over. For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does not do full reference-counting of iterated items, hence deleting such an item in the middle of an iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of *glob{FILEHANDLE} is deprecated</dt>

(D deprecated) You are now encouraged to use the shorter *glob{IO} form to access the filehandle slot within a typeglob.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split</dt>
<dd>
(W regexp) You used the /g modifier on the pattern for a &quot;split&quot; operator.  Since &quot;split&quot; always tries to match the pattern repeatedly, the &quot;/g&quot; has no effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of &quot;goto&quot; to jump into a construct is deprecated</dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; subroutines are looked up as methods (using the @ISA hierarchy) even when the subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g. &quot;Foo::bar()&quot;), not as methods (e.g. &quot;Foo-&gt;bar()&quot; or &quot;$obj-&gt;bar()&quot;).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for methods' &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;s.  However, there is a significant base of existing code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;s.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used to depend on inheriting &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; for non-methods from a base class named &quot;BaseClass&quot;, execute &quot;*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD&quot; during startup.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In code that currently says &quot;use AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);&quot; you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change &quot;use AutoLoader;&quot; to &quot;use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';&quot;.</dd>

Use of %s in printf format not supported</dt>
<dd>
(F) You attempted to use a feature of printf that is accessible from only C.  This usually means there's a better way to do it in Perl.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of %s is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) The construct indicated is no longer recommended for use, generally because there's a better way to do it, and also because the old way has bad side effects.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of literal control characters in variable names is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) Using literal control characters in the source to refer to the ^FOO variables, like $^X and &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot; is now deprecated.  This only affects code like &quot;$\cT&quot;, where \cT is a control in the source code: &quot;${&quot;\cT&quot;}&quot; and $^T remain valid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of -l on filehandle%s</dt>
<dd>
(W io) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you opened the file it already went past any symlink you are presumably trying to look for. The operation returned &quot;undef&quot;.  Use a filename instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of my $_ is experimental</dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of %s on a handle without * is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You used &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;tied&quot; or &quot;untie&quot; on a scalar but that scalar happens to hold a typeglob, which means its filehandle will be tied.  If you mean to tie a handle, use an explicit * as in &quot;tie *$handle&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This was a long-standing bug that was removed in Perl 5.16, as there was no way to tie the scalar itself when it held a typeglob, and no way to untie a scalar that had had a typeglob assigned to it.  If you see this message, you must be using an older version.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of ?PATTERN? without explicit operator is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You have written something like &quot;?\w?&quot;, for a regular expression that matches only once.  Starting this term directly with the question mark delimiter is now deprecated, so that the question mark will be available for use in new operators in the future.  Write &quot;m?\w?&quot; instead, explicitly using the &quot;m&quot; operator: the question mark delimiter still invokes match-once behaviour.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of reference &quot;%s&quot; as array index</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) You tried to use a reference as an array index; this probably isn't what you mean, because references in numerical context tend to be huge numbers, and so usually indicates programmer error.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you really do mean it, explicitly numify your reference, like so: $array[0+$ref].  This warning is not given for overloaded objects, however, because you can overload the numification and stringification operators and then you presumably know what you are doing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of state $_ is experimental</dt>
<dd>
(S experimental::lexical_topic) Lexical $_ is an experimental feature and its behavior may change or even be removed in any future release of perl. See the explanation under &quot;$_&quot; in perlvar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of tainted arguments in %s is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(W taint, deprecated) You have supplied &quot;system()&quot; or &quot;exec()&quot; with multiple arguments and at least one of them is tainted.  This used to be allowed but will become a fatal error in a future version of perl.  Untaint your arguments.  See perlsec.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of uninitialized value%s</dt>
<dd>
(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already defined.  It was interpreted as a &quot;&quot; or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake. To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you the name of the variable (if any) that was undefined.  In some cases it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your program and the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear literally in your program.  For example, &quot;that $foo&quot; is usually optimized into &quot;&quot;that &quot; . $foo&quot;, and the warning will refer to the &quot;concatenation (.)&quot; operator, even though there is no &quot;.&quot; in your program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use \x{...} for more than two hex characters in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) In a regular expression, you said something like<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 (?[ [ \xBEEF ] ])<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl isn't sure if you meant this<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 (?[ [ \x{BEEF} ] ])<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
or if you meant this<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 (?[ [ \x{BE} E F ] ])<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You need to add either braces or blanks to disambiguate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Using a hash as a reference is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in &quot;%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}&quot; or &quot;%$ref-&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}&quot;.  Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't have.  It is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Using an array as a reference is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in &quot;@foo-&gt;[23]&quot; or &quot;@$ref-&gt;[99]&quot;.  Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't have.  It is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Using just the first character returned by \N{} in character class in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(W regexp) A charnames handler may return a sequence of more than one character.  Currently all but the first one are discarded when used in a regular expression pattern bracketed character class.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Using !~ with %s doesn't make sense</dt>
<dd>
(F) Using the &quot;!~&quot; operator with &quot;s///r&quot;, &quot;tr///r&quot; or &quot;y///r&quot; is currently reserved for future use, as the exact behaviour has not been decided.  (Simply returning the boolean opposite of the modified string is usually not particularly useful.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</dt>
<dd>
(S surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are not considered acceptable.  These code points, between U+D800 and U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16.  However, Perl internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit available on your platform), including surrogates.  But these can cause problems when being input or output, which is likely where this message came from.  If you really really know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by &quot;no warnings 'surrogate';&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Value of %s can be &quot;0&quot;; test with <i>defined()</i></dt>
<dd>
(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt; (glob), &quot;each()&quot;, or &quot;readdir()&quot; as a boolean value.  Each of these constructs can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that would make the conditional expression false, which is probably not what you intended.  When using these constructs in conditional expressions, test their values with the &quot;defined&quot; operator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Value of CLI symbol &quot;%s&quot; too long</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the value of an %ENV element from a CLI symbol table, and found a resultant string longer than 1024 characters.  The return value has been truncated to 1024 characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
values on reference is experimental</dt>
<dd>
(S experimental::autoderef) &quot;values&quot; with a scalar argument is experimental and may change or be removed in a future Perl version.  If you want to take the risk of using this feature, simply disable this warning:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::autoderef&quot;;<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not available</dt>
<dd>
(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available. This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the outer lexical may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.)  For example,<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { my $a; sub f { $a } }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current value of $a, since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.  Conversely, the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { my $a; eval 'sub f { $a }' }-&gt;();<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has gone out of scope, for example,<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub f {<br/>
        my $a;<br/>
        sub { eval '$a' }<br/>
    }<br/>
    f()-&gt;();<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being executed, so its $a is not available for capture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not imported%s</dt>
<dd>
(S misc) With &quot;use strict&quot; in effect, you referred to a global variable that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the front of your variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Variable length lookbehind not implemented in regex m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) Lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions whose length is fixed and known at compile time.  For positive lookbehind, you can use the &quot;\K&quot; regex construct as a way to get the equivalent functionality.  See &quot;(?&lt;=pattern) \K&quot; in perlre.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There are non-obvious Unicode rules under &quot;/i&quot; that can match variably, but which you might not think could.  For example, the substring &quot;ss&quot; can match the single character LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S.  There are other sequences of ASCII characters that can match single ligature characters, such as LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI matching &quot;qr/ffi/i&quot;. Starting in Perl v5.16, if you only care about ASCII matches, adding the &quot;/aa&quot; modifier to the regex will exclude all these non-obvious matches, thus getting rid of this message.  You can also say &quot;use&#160;re&#160;qw(/aa)&quot; to apply &quot;/aa&quot; to all regular expressions compiled within its scope. See re.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;%s&quot; variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) A &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; variable has been redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.  Note that the earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Variable syntax</dt>
<dd>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Variable &quot;%s&quot; will not stay shared</dt>
<dd>
(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first* call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no longer share a common value for the variable.  In other words, the variable will no longer be shared.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine anonymous, using the &quot;sub {}&quot; syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that reference variables in outer subroutines are created, they are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
vector argument not supported with alpha versions</dt>
<dd>
(S printf) The %vd (s)printf format does not support version objects with alpha parts.</dd>

Verb pattern '%s' has a mandatory argument in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>

(F) You used a verb pattern that requires an argument.  Supply an argument or check that you are using the right verb.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Verb pattern '%s' may not have an argument in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used a verb pattern that is not allowed an argument.  Remove the argument or check that you are using the right verb.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Version number must be a constant number</dt>
<dd>
(P) The attempt to translate a &quot;use Module n.n LIST&quot; statement into its equivalent &quot;BEGIN&quot; block found an internal inconsistency with the version number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Version string '%s' contains invalid data; ignoring: '%s'</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) The version string contains invalid characters at the end, which are being ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Warning: something's wrong</dt>
<dd>
(W) You passed <i>warn()</i> an empty string (the equivalent of &quot;warn &quot;&quot;&quot;) or you called it with no args and $@ was empty.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly</dt>
<dd>
(S) The implicit <i>close()</i> done by an <i>open()</i> got an error indication on the  <i>close()</i>.  This usually indicates your file system ran out of disk space.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Warning: Use of &quot;%s&quot; without parentheses is ambiguous</dt>
<dd>
(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that looks like a binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a term or unary operator.  For instance, if you know that the rand function has a default argument of 1.0, and you write<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    rand + 5;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
you may THINK you wrote the same thing as<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    rand() + 5;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
but in actual fact, you got<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    rand(+5);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
So put in parentheses to say what you really mean.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
when is experimental</dt>
<dd>
(S experimental::smartmatch) &quot;when&quot; depends on smartmatch, which is experimental.  Additionally, it has several special cases that may not be immediately obvious, and their behavior may change or even be removed in any future release of perl.  See the explanation under &quot;Experimental Details on given and when&quot; in perlsyn.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Wide character in %s</dt>
<dd>
(S utf8) Perl met a wide character (&gt;255) when it wasn't expecting one.  This warning is by default on for I/O (like print).  The easiest way to quiet this warning is simply to add the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer to the output, e.g. &quot;binmode STDOUT, ':utf8'&quot;.  Another way to turn off the warning is to add &quot;no warnings 'utf8';&quot; but that is often closer to cheating.  In general, you are supposed to explicitly mark the filehandle with an encoding, see open and &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Within []-length '%c' not allowed</dt>
<dd>
(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by &quot;[TEMPLATE]&quot; only if &quot;TEMPLATE&quot; always matches the same amount of packed bytes that can be determined from the template alone.  This is not possible if it contains any of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a *-length.  Redesign the template.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>write()</i> on closed filehandle %s</dt>
<dd>
(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime before now.  Check your control flow.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s &quot;\x%X&quot; does not map to Unicode</dt>
<dd>
(S utf8) When reading in different encodings, Perl tries to map everything into Unicode characters.  The bytes you read in are not legal in this encoding.  For example<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    utf8 &quot;\xE4&quot; does not map to Unicode<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
'X' outside of string</dt>
<dd>
(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative position before the beginning of the string being (un)packed.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
'x' outside of string in unpack</dt>
<dd>
(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after the end of the string being unpacked.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</dt>
<dd>
(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip about what you want.  Your best bet is to put a setuid C wrapper around your script.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
You need to quote &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name. Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared, which means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want.  (If it IS what you want, put an &amp; in front.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Your random numbers are not that random</dt>
<dd>
(F) When trying to initialize the random seed for hashes, Perl could not get any randomness out of your system.  This usually indicates Something Very Wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Zero length \N{} in regex; marked by &lt;--&#160;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>
(F) Named Unicode character escapes (&quot;\N{...}&quot;) may return a zero-length sequence.  Such an escape was used in an extended character class, i.e. &quot;(?[...])&quot;, which is not permitted.  Check that the correct escape has been used, and the correct charnames handler is in scope.  The &lt;--&#160;HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.</dd>
