<h1>NAME</h1> perl5180delta - what is new for perl v5.18.0</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the v5.16.0 release and the v5.18.0 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.14.0, first read perl5160delta, which describes differences between v5.14.0 and v5.16.0.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>New mechanism for experimental features</h2> Newly-added experimental features will now require this incantation:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::feature_name&quot;;<br/>
    use feature &quot;feature_name&quot;;  # would warn without the prev line<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is a new warnings category, called &quot;experimental&quot;, containing warnings that the feature pragma emits when enabling experimental features.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Newly-added experimental features will also be given special warning IDs, which consist of &quot;experimental::&quot; followed by the name of the feature.  (The plan is to extend this mechanism eventually to all warnings, to allow them to be enabled or disabled individually, and not just by category.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
By saying<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::feature_name&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
you are taking responsibility for any breakage that future changes to, or removal of, the feature may cause.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since some features (like &quot;~~&quot; or &quot;my $_&quot;) now emit experimental warnings, and you may want to disable them in code that is also run on perls that do not recognize these warning categories, consider using the &quot;if&quot; pragma like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    no if $] &gt;= 5.018, warnings =&gt; &quot;experimental::feature_name&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Existing experimental features may begin emitting these warnings, too.  Please consult perlexperiment for information on which features are considered experimental.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Hash overhaul</h2> Changes to the implementation of hashes in perl v5.18.0 will be one of the most visible changes to the behavior of existing code.<div class="spacer">
</div>
By default, two distinct hash variables with identical keys and values may now provide their contents in a different order where it was previously identical.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When encountering these changes, the key to cleaning up from them is to accept that  <b>hashes are unordered collections</b> and to act accordingly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Hash randomization</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The seed used by Perl's hash function is now random.  This means that the order which keys/values will be returned from functions like &quot;keys()&quot;, &quot;values()&quot;, and &quot;each()&quot; will differ from run to run.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This change was introduced to make Perl's hashes more robust to algorithmic complexity attacks, and also because we discovered that it exposes hash ordering dependency bugs and makes them easier to track down.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Toolchain maintainers might want to invest in additional infrastructure to test for things like this.  Running tests several times in a row and then comparing results will make it easier to spot hash order dependencies in code.  Authors are strongly encouraged not to expose the key order of Perl's hashes to insecure audiences.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Further, every hash has its own iteration order, which should make it much more difficult to determine what the current hash seed is.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>New hash functions</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl v5.18 includes support for multiple hash functions, and changed the default (to ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD), you can choose a different algorithm by defining a symbol at compile time.  For a current list, consult the  <i>INSTALL</i> document.  Note that as of Perl v5.18 we can only recommend use of the default or SIPHASH. All the others are known to have security issues and are for research purposes only.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>PERL_HASH_SEED environment variable now takes a hex value</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot; no longer accepts an integer as a parameter; instead the value is expected to be a binary value encoded in a hex string, such as &quot;0xf5867c55039dc724&quot;.  This is to make the infrastructure support hash seeds of arbitrary lengths, which might exceed that of an integer.  (SipHash uses a 16 byte seed.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>PERL_PERTURB_KEYS environment variable added</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot; environment variable allows one to control the level of randomization applied to &quot;keys&quot; and friends.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When &quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot; is 0, perl will not randomize the key order at all. The chance that &quot;keys&quot; changes due to an insert will be the same as in previous perls, basically only when the bucket size is changed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When &quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot; is 1, perl will randomize keys in a non-repeatable way. The chance that &quot;keys&quot; changes due to an insert will be very high.  This is the most secure and default mode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When &quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot; is 2, perl will randomize keys in a repeatable way. Repeated runs of the same program should produce the same output every time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot; implies a non-default &quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot; setting. Setting &quot;PERL_HASH_SEED=0&quot; (exactly one 0) implies &quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=0&quot; (hash key randomization disabled); setting &quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot; to any other value implies &quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=2&quot; (deterministic and repeatable hash key randomization). Specifying &quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot; explicitly to a different level overrides this behavior.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><i>Hash::Util::hash_seed()</i><i> now returns a string</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Hash::Util::hash_seed()</i> now returns a string instead of an integer.  This is to make the infrastructure support hash seeds of arbitrary lengths which might exceed that of an integer.  (SipHash uses a 16 byte seed.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Output of PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG has been changed</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The environment variable PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG now makes perl show both the hash function perl was built with,  <i>and</i> the seed, in hex, in use for that process. Code parsing this output, should it exist, must change to accommodate the new format.  Example of the new format:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $ PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG=1 ./perl -e1<br/>
    HASH_FUNCTION = MURMUR3 HASH_SEED = 0x1476bb9f<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Upgrade to Unicode 6.2</h2> Perl now supports Unicode 6.2.  A list of changes from Unicode 6.1 is at &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0&gt;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Character name aliases may now include non-Latin1-range characters</h2> It is possible to define your own names for characters for use in &quot;\N{...}&quot;, &quot;charnames::vianame()&quot;, etc.  These names can now be comprised of characters from the whole Unicode range.  This allows for names to be in your native language, and not just English.  Certain restrictions apply to the characters that may be used (you can't define a name that has punctuation in it, for example).  See &quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in charnames.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New DTrace probes</h2> The following new DTrace probes have been added:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;op-entry&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;loading-file&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;loaded-file&quot;</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;${^LAST_FH}&quot;</h2> This new variable provides access to the filehandle that was last read. This is the handle used by $. and by &quot;tell&quot; and &quot;eof&quot; without arguments.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Regular Expression Set Operations</h2> This is an  <b>experimental</b> feature to allow matching against the union, intersection, etc., of sets of code points, similar to Unicode::Regex::Set.  It can also be used to extend &quot;/x&quot; processing to [bracketed] character classes, and as a replacement of user-defined properties, allowing more complex expressions than they do.  See &quot;Extended Bracketed Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Lexical subroutines</h2> This new feature is still considered  <b>experimental</b>.  To enable it:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use 5.018;<br/>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::lexical_subs&quot;;<br/>
    use feature &quot;lexical_subs&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can now declare subroutines with &quot;state sub foo&quot;, &quot;my sub foo&quot;, and &quot;our sub foo&quot;.  (&quot;state sub&quot; requires that the &quot;state&quot; feature be enabled, unless you write it as &quot;CORE::state sub foo&quot;.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;state sub&quot; creates a subroutine visible within the lexical scope in which it is declared.  The subroutine is shared between calls to the outer sub.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;my sub&quot; declares a lexical subroutine that is created each time the enclosing block is entered.  &quot;state sub&quot; is generally slightly faster than &quot;my sub&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;our sub&quot; declares a lexical alias to the package subroutine of the same name.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For more information, see &quot;Lexical Subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Computed Labels</h2> The loop controls &quot;next&quot;, &quot;last&quot; and &quot;redo&quot;, and the special &quot;dump&quot; operator, now allow arbitrary expressions to be used to compute labels at run time.  Previously, any argument that was not a constant was treated as the empty string.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>More CORE:: subs</h2> Several more built-in functions have been added as subroutines to the CORE:: namespace - namely, those non-overridable keywords that can be implemented without custom parsers: &quot;defined&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;exists&quot;, &quot;glob&quot;, &quot;pos&quot;, &quot;prototype&quot;, &quot;scalar&quot;, &quot;split&quot;, &quot;study&quot;, and &quot;undef&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As some of these have prototypes, &quot;prototype('CORE::...')&quot; has been changed to not make a distinction between overridable and non-overridable keywords.  This is to make &quot;prototype('CORE::pos')&quot; consistent with &quot;prototype(&amp;CORE::pos)&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;kill&quot; with negative signal names</h2> &quot;kill&quot; has always allowed a negative signal number, which kills the process group instead of a single process.  It has also allowed signal names.  But it did not behave consistently, because negative signal names were treated as 0.  Now negative signals names like &quot;-INT&quot; are supported and treated the same way as -2 [perl #112990].</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Security</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>See also: hash overhaul</h2> Some of the changes in the hash overhaul were made to enhance security.  Please read that section.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;Storable&quot; security warning in documentation</h2> The documentation for &quot;Storable&quot; now includes a section which warns readers of the danger of accepting Storable documents from untrusted sources. The short version is that deserializing certain types of data can lead to loading modules and other code execution. This is documented behavior and wanted behavior, but this opens an attack vector for malicious entities.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;Locale::Maketext&quot; allowed code injection via a malicious template</h2> If users could provide a translation string to Locale::Maketext, this could be used to invoke arbitrary Perl subroutines available in the current process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This has been fixed, but it is still possible to invoke any method provided by &quot;Locale::Maketext&quot; itself or a subclass that you are using. One of these methods in turn will invoke the Perl core's &quot;sprintf&quot; subroutine.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In summary, allowing users to provide translation strings without auditing them is a bad idea.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This vulnerability is documented in CVE-2012-6329.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Avoid calling memset with a negative count</h2> Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify the count to perl's &quot;x&quot; string repeat operator can already cause a memory exhaustion denial-of-service attack. A flaw in versions of perl before v5.15.5 can escalate that into a heap buffer overrun; coupled with versions of glibc before 2.16, it possibly allows the execution of arbitrary code.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The flaw addressed to this commit has been assigned identifier CVE-2012-5195 and was researched by Tim Brown.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>See also: hash overhaul</h2> Some of the changes in the hash overhaul are not fully compatible with previous versions of perl.  Please read that section.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>An unknown character name in &quot;\N{...}&quot; is now a syntax error</h2> Previously, it warned, and the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER was substituted.  Unicode now recommends that this situation be a syntax error.  Also, the previous behavior led to some confusing warnings and behaviors, and since the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER has no use other than as a stand-in for some unknown character, any code that has this problem is buggy.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Formerly deprecated characters in &quot;\N{}&quot; character name aliases are now errors.</h2> Since v5.12.0, it has been deprecated to use certain characters in user-defined &quot;\N{...}&quot; character names.  These now cause a syntax error.  For example, it is now an error to begin a name with a digit, such as in<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 my $undraftable = &quot;\N{4F}&quot;;    # Syntax error!<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
or to have commas anywhere in the name.  See &quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in charnames.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;\N{BELL}&quot; now refers to U+1F514 instead of U+0007</h2> Unicode 6.0 reused the name &quot;BELL&quot; for a different code point than it traditionally had meant.  Since Perl v5.14, use of this name still referred to U+0007, but would raise a deprecation warning.  Now, &quot;BELL&quot; refers to U+1F514, and the name for U+0007 is &quot;ALERT&quot;.  All the functions in charnames have been correspondingly updated.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New Restrictions in Multi-Character Case-Insensitive Matching in Regular Expression Bracketed Character Classes</h2> Unicode has now withdrawn their previous recommendation for regular expressions to automatically handle cases where a single character can match multiple characters case-insensitively, for example, the letter LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S and the sequence &quot;ss&quot;.  This is because it turns out to be impracticable to do this correctly in all circumstances.  Because Perl has tried to do this as best it can, it will continue to do so.  (We are considering an option to turn it off.) However, a new restriction is being added on such matches when they occur in [bracketed] character classes.  People were specifying things such as &quot;/[\0-\xff]/i&quot;, and being surprised that it matches the two character sequence &quot;ss&quot; (since LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S occurs in this range).  This behavior is also inconsistent with using a property instead of a range:  &quot;\p{Block=Latin1}&quot; also includes LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S, but &quot;/[\p{Block=Latin1}]/i&quot; does not match &quot;ss&quot;. The new rule is that for there to be a multi-character case-insensitive match within a bracketed character class, the character must be explicitly listed, and not as an end point of a range.  This more closely obeys the Principle of Least Astonishment.  See &quot;Bracketed Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.  Note that a bug [perl #89774], now fixed as part of this change, prevented the previous behavior from working fully.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Explicit rules for variable names and identifiers</h2> Due to an oversight, single character variable names in v5.16 were completely unrestricted.  This opened the door to several kinds of insanity.  As of v5.18, these now follow the rules of other identifiers, in addition to accepting characters that match the &quot;\p{POSIX_Punct}&quot; property.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is no longer any difference in the parsing of identifiers specified by using braces versus without braces.  For instance, perl used to allow &quot;${foo:bar}&quot; (with a single colon) but not $foo:bar. Now that both are handled by a single code path, they are both treated the same way: both are forbidden.  Note that this change is about the range of permissible literal identifiers, not other expressions.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Vertical tabs are now whitespace</h2> No one could recall why &quot;\s&quot; didn't match &quot;\cK&quot;, the vertical tab. Now it does.  Given the extreme rarity of that character, very little breakage is expected.  That said, here's what it means:<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\s&quot; in a regex now matches a vertical tab in all circumstances.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Literal vertical tabs in a regex literal are ignored when the &quot;/x&quot; modifier is used.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Leading vertical tabs, alone or mixed with other whitespace, are now ignored when interpreting a string as a number.  For example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  $dec = &quot; \cK \t 123&quot;;<br/>
  $hex = &quot; \cK \t 0xF&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
  say 0 + $dec;   # was 0 with warning, now 123<br/>
  say int $dec;   # was 0, now 123<br/>
  say oct $hex;   # was 0, now  15<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;/(?{})/&quot; and &quot;/(??{})/&quot; have been heavily reworked</h2> The implementation of this feature has been almost completely rewritten. Although its main intent is to fix bugs, some behaviors, especially related to the scope of lexical variables, will have changed.  This is described more fully in the &quot;Selected Bug Fixes&quot; section.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Stricter parsing of substitution replacement</h2> It is no longer possible to abuse the way the parser parses &quot;s///e&quot; like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    %_=(_,&quot;Just another &quot;);<br/>
    $_=&quot;Perl hacker,\n&quot;;<br/>
    s//_}-&gt;{_/e;print<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;given&quot; now aliases the global $_</h2> Instead of assigning to an implicit lexical $_, &quot;given&quot; now makes the global $_ an alias for its argument, just like &quot;foreach&quot;.  However, it still uses lexical $_ if there is lexical $_ in scope (again, just like &quot;foreach&quot;) [perl #114020].</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The smartmatch family of features are now experimental</h2> Smart match, added in v5.10.0 and significantly revised in v5.10.1, has been a regular point of complaint.  Although there are a number of ways in which it is useful, it has also proven problematic and confusing for both users and implementors of Perl.  There have been a number of proposals on how to best address the problem.  It is clear that smartmatch is almost certainly either going to change or go away in the future.  Relying on its current behavior is not recommended.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Warnings will now be issued when the parser sees &quot;~~&quot;, &quot;given&quot;, or &quot;when&quot;. To disable these warnings, you can add this line to the appropriate scope:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  no if $] &gt;= 5.018, warnings =&gt; &quot;experimental::smartmatch&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Consider, though, replacing the use of these features, as they may change behavior again before becoming stable.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Lexical $_ is now experimental</h2> Since it was introduced in Perl v5.10, it has caused much confusion with no obvious solution:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Various modules (e.g., List::Util) expect callback routines to use the global $_.  &quot;use List::Util 'first'; my $_; first { $_ == 1 } @list&quot; does not work as one would expect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A &quot;my $_&quot; declaration earlier in the same file can cause confusing closure warnings.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;_&quot; subroutine prototype character allows called subroutines to access your lexical $_, so it is not really private after all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Nevertheless, subroutines with a &quot;(@)&quot; prototype and methods cannot access the caller's lexical $_, unless they are written in XS.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
But even XS routines cannot access a lexical $_ declared, not in the calling subroutine, but in an outer scope, iff that subroutine happened not to mention $_ or use any operators that default to $_.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is our hope that lexical $_ can be rehabilitated, but this may cause changes in its behavior.  Please use it with caution until it becomes stable.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>readline()</i> with &quot;$/ = \N&quot; now reads N characters, not N bytes</h2> Previously, when reading from a stream with I/O layers such as &quot;encoding&quot;, the  <i>readline()</i> function, otherwise known as the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator, would read  <i>N</i> bytes from the top-most layer. [perl #79960]<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now, <i>N</i> characters are read instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is no change in behaviour when reading from streams with no extra layers, since bytes map exactly to characters.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Overridden &quot;glob&quot; is now passed one argument</h2> &quot;glob&quot; overrides used to be passed a magical undocumented second argument that identified the caller.  Nothing on CPAN was using this, and it got in the way of a bug fix, so it was removed.  If you really need to identify the caller, see Devel::Callsite on CPAN.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Here doc parsing</h2> The body of a here document inside a quote-like operator now always begins on the line after the &quot;&lt;&lt;foo&quot; marker.  Previously, it was documented to begin on the line following the containing quote-like operator, but that was only sometimes the case [perl #114040].</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Alphanumeric operators must now be separated from the closing delimiter of regular expressions</h2> You may no longer write something like:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 m/a/and 1<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Instead you must write<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 m/a/ and 1<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
with whitespace separating the operator from the closing delimiter of the regular expression.  Not having whitespace has resulted in a deprecation warning since Perl v5.14.0.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>qw(...) can no longer be used as parentheses</h2> &quot;qw&quot; lists used to fool the parser into thinking they were always surrounded by parentheses.  This permitted some surprising constructions such as &quot;foreach $x qw(a b c) {...}&quot;, which should really be written &quot;foreach $x (qw(a b c)) {...}&quot;.  These would sometimes get the lexer into the wrong state, so they didn't fully work, and the similar &quot;foreach qw(a b c) {...}&quot; that one might expect to be permitted never worked at all.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This side effect of &quot;qw&quot; has now been abolished.  It has been deprecated since Perl v5.13.11.  It is now necessary to use real parentheses everywhere that the grammar calls for them.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Interaction of lexical and default warnings</h2> Turning on any lexical warnings used first to disable all default warnings if lexical warnings were not already enabled:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $*; # deprecation warning<br/>
    use warnings &quot;void&quot;;<br/>
    $#; # void warning; no deprecation warning<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now, the &quot;debugging&quot;, &quot;deprecated&quot;, &quot;glob&quot;, &quot;inplace&quot; and &quot;malloc&quot; warnings categories are left on when turning on lexical warnings (unless they are turned off by &quot;no warnings&quot;, of course).<div class="spacer">
</div>
This may cause deprecation warnings to occur in code that used to be free of warnings.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Those are the only categories consisting only of default warnings.  Default warnings in other categories are still disabled by &quot;use warnings &quot;category&quot;&quot;, as we do not yet have the infrastructure for controlling individual warnings.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;state sub&quot; and &quot;our sub&quot;</h2> Due to an accident of history, &quot;state sub&quot; and &quot;our sub&quot; were equivalent to a plain &quot;sub&quot;, so one could even create an anonymous sub with &quot;our sub { ... }&quot;.  These are now disallowed outside of the &quot;lexical_subs&quot; feature.  Under the &quot;lexical_subs&quot; feature they have new meanings described in &quot;Lexical Subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Defined values stored in environment are forced to byte strings</h2> A value stored in an environment variable has always been stringified when inherited by child processes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In this release, when assigning to %ENV, values are immediately stringified, and converted to be only a byte string.<div class="spacer">
</div>
First, it is forced to be a only a string.  Then if the string is utf8 and the equivalent of &quot;utf8::downgrade()&quot; works, that result is used; otherwise, the equivalent of &quot;utf8::encode()&quot; is used, and a warning is issued about wide characters (&quot;Diagnostics&quot;).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;require&quot; dies for unreadable files</h2> When &quot;require&quot; encounters an unreadable file, it now dies.  It used to ignore the file and continue searching the directories in @INC [perl #113422].</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;gv_fetchmeth_*&quot; and SUPER</h2> The various &quot;gv_fetchmeth_*&quot; XS functions used to treat a package whose named ended with &quot;::SUPER&quot; specially.  A method lookup on the &quot;Foo::SUPER&quot; package would be treated as a &quot;SUPER&quot; method lookup on the &quot;Foo&quot; package.  This is no longer the case.  To do a &quot;SUPER&quot; lookup, pass the &quot;Foo&quot; stash and the &quot;GV_SUPER&quot; flag.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;split&quot;'s first argument is more consistently interpreted</h2> After some changes earlier in v5.17, &quot;split&quot;'s behavior has been simplified: if the PATTERN argument evaluates to a string containing one space, it is treated the way that a  <i>literal</i> string containing one space once was.</div>
</div>

<h2>Module removals</h2> The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN. Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as prerequisites.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The core versions of these modules will now issue &quot;deprecated&quot;-category warnings to alert you to this fact. To silence these deprecation warnings, install the modules in question from CPAN.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged to continue to use. Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation, not usually on concerns over their design.<dl>
<dt>
encoding</dt>
<dd>
The use of this pragma is now strongly discouraged. It conflates the encoding of source text with the encoding of I/O data, reinterprets escape sequences in source text (a questionable choice), and introduces the UTF-8 bug to all runtime handling of character strings. It is broken as designed and beyond repair.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For using non-ASCII literal characters in source text, please refer to utf8. For dealing with textual I/O data, please refer to Encode and open.</dd>

<h2>PL_sv_objcount</h2> This interpreter-global variable used to track the total number of Perl objects in the interpreter. It is no longer maintained and will be removed altogether in Perl v5.20.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Five additional characters should be escaped in patterns with &quot;/x&quot;</h2> When a regular expression pattern is compiled with &quot;/x&quot;, Perl treats 6 characters as white space to ignore, such as SPACE and TAB.  However, Unicode recommends 11 characters be treated thusly.  We will conform with this in a future Perl version.  In the meantime, use of any of the missing characters will raise a deprecation warning, unless turned off. The five characters are:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    U+0085 NEXT LINE<br/>
    U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK<br/>
    U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK<br/>
    U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR<br/>
    U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>User-defined charnames with surprising whitespace</h2> A user-defined character name with trailing or multiple spaces in a row is likely a typo.  This now generates a warning when defined, on the assumption that uses of it will be unlikely to include the excess whitespace.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Various XS-callable functions are now deprecated</h2> All the functions used to classify characters will be removed from a future version of Perl, and should not be used.  With participating C compilers (e.g., gcc), compiling any file that uses any of these will generate a warning.  These were not intended for public use; there are equivalent, faster, macros for most of them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;Character classes&quot; in perlapi.  The complete list is:<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;is_uni_alnum&quot;, &quot;is_uni_alnumc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_alnumc_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_alnum_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_alpha&quot;, &quot;is_uni_alpha_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_ascii&quot;, &quot;is_uni_ascii_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_blank&quot;, &quot;is_uni_blank_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_cntrl&quot;, &quot;is_uni_cntrl_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_digit&quot;, &quot;is_uni_digit_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_graph&quot;, &quot;is_uni_graph_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_idfirst&quot;, &quot;is_uni_idfirst_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_lower&quot;, &quot;is_uni_lower_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_print&quot;, &quot;is_uni_print_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_punct&quot;, &quot;is_uni_punct_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_space&quot;, &quot;is_uni_space_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_upper&quot;, &quot;is_uni_upper_lc&quot;, &quot;is_uni_xdigit&quot;, &quot;is_uni_xdigit_lc&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_alnum&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_alnumc&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_alpha&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_ascii&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_blank&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_char&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_cntrl&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_digit&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_graph&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_idcont&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_idfirst&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_lower&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_mark&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_perl_space&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_perl_word&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_posix_digit&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_print&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_punct&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_space&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_upper&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_xdigit&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_xidcont&quot;, &quot;is_utf8_xidfirst&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In addition these three functions that have never worked properly are deprecated: &quot;to_uni_lower_lc&quot;, &quot;to_uni_title_lc&quot;, and &quot;to_uni_upper_lc&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Certain rare uses of backslashes within regexes are now deprecated</h2> There are three pairs of characters that Perl recognizes as metacharacters in regular expression patterns: &quot;{}&quot;, &quot;[]&quot;, and &quot;()&quot;. These can be used as well to delimit patterns, as in:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  m{foo}<br/>
  s(foo)(bar)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since they are metacharacters, they have special meaning to regular expression patterns, and it turns out that you can't turn off that special meaning by the normal means of preceding them with a backslash, if you use them, paired, within a pattern delimited by them.  For example, in<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  m{foo\{1,3\}}<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
the backslashes do not change the behavior, and this matches &quot;f&#160;o&quot; followed by one to three more occurrences of &quot;o&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Usages like this, where they are interpreted as metacharacters, are exceedingly rare; we think there are none, for example, in all of CPAN. Hence, this deprecation should affect very little code.  It does give notice, however, that any such code needs to change, which will in turn allow us to change the behavior in future Perl versions so that the backslashes do have an effect, and without fear that we are silently breaking any existing code.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Splitting the tokens &quot;(?&quot; and &quot;(*&quot; in regular expressions</h2> A deprecation warning is now raised if the &quot;(&quot; and &quot;?&quot; are separated by white space or comments in &quot;(?...)&quot; regular expression constructs. Similarly, if the &quot;(&quot; and &quot;*&quot; are separated in &quot;(*VERB...)&quot; constructs.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Pre-PerlIO IO implementations</h2> In theory, you can currently build perl without PerlIO.  Instead, you'd use a wrapper around stdio or sfio.  In practice, this isn't very useful.  It's not well tested, and without any support for IO layers or (thus) Unicode, it's not much of a perl.  Building without PerlIO will most likely be removed in the next version of perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
PerlIO supports a &quot;stdio&quot; layer if stdio use is desired.  Similarly a sfio layer could be produced in the future, if needed.</div>

<h1>Future Deprecations</h1><dl>

<dd>
Platforms without support infrastructure<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Both Windows CE and z/OS have been historically under-maintained, and are currently neither successfully building nor regularly being smoke tested. Efforts are underway to change this situation, but it should not be taken for granted that the platforms are safe and supported.  If they do not become buildable and regularly smoked, support for them may be actively removed in future releases.  If you have an interest in these platforms and you can lend your time, expertise, or hardware to help support these platforms, please let the perl development effort know by emailing &quot;perl5-porters@perl.org&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Some platforms that appear otherwise entirely dead are also on the short list for removal between now and v5.20.0:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>

DG/UX</dt>

</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
We also think it likely that current versions of Perl will no longer build AmigaOS, DJGPP, NetWare (natively), OS/2 and Plan 9. If you are using Perl on such a platform and have an interest in ensuring Perl's future on them, please contact us.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
We believe that Perl has long been unable to build on mixed endian architectures (such as PDP-11s), and intend to remove any remaining support code. Similarly, code supporting the long umaintained GNU dld will be removed soon if no-one makes themselves known as an active user.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Swapping of $&lt; and $&gt;<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl has supported the idiom of swapping $&lt; and $&gt; (and likewise $( and $)) to temporarily drop permissions since 5.0, like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    ($&lt;, $&gt;) = ($&gt;, $&lt;);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
However, this idiom modifies the real user/group id, which can have undesirable side-effects, is no longer useful on any platform perl supports and complicates the implementation of these variables and list assignment in general.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As an alternative, assignment only to $&gt; is recommended:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    local $&gt; = $&lt;;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Revamping &quot;\Q&quot; semantics in double-quotish strings when combined with other escapes.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

There are several bugs and inconsistencies involving combinations of &quot;\Q&quot; and escapes like &quot;\x&quot;, &quot;\L&quot;, etc., within a &quot;\Q...\E&quot; pair. These need to be fixed, and doing so will necessarily change current behavior.  The changes have not yet been settled.</dd>

Use of $x, where &quot;x&quot; stands for any actual (non-printing) C0 control character will be disallowed in a future Perl version.  Use &quot;${x}&quot; instead (where again &quot;x&quot; stands for a control character), or better, $^A , where &quot;^&quot; is a caret (CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT), and &quot;A&quot; stands for any of the characters listed at the end of &quot;OPERATOR DIFFERENCES&quot; in perlebcdic.</dd>

A new C preprocessor define &quot;NO_TAINT_SUPPORT&quot; was added that, if set, disables Perl's taint support altogether.  Using the -T or -t command line flags will cause a fatal error.  Beware that both core tests as well as many a CPAN distribution's tests will fail with this change.  On the upside, it provides a small performance benefit due to reduced branching.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Formerly, whichever of &quot;use bigint&quot; or &quot;use bigrat&quot; was compiled later would take precedence over the other, causing &quot;hex&quot; and &quot;oct&quot; not to respect the other pragma when in scope.</dd>

File::Glob has been upgraded to 1.20.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
File::Glob has had exactly the same fix as File::DosGlob.  Since it is what Perl's own &quot;glob&quot; operator itself uses (except on VMS), this means &quot;eval 'scalar &lt;*&gt;'&quot; no longer leaks.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

File::stat has been upgraded to 1.07.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;File::stat&quot; ignores the filetest pragma, and warns when used in combination therewith.  But it was not warning for &quot;-r&quot;.  This has been fixed [perl #111640].<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;-p&quot; now works, and does not return false for pipes [perl #111638].<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Previously &quot;File::stat&quot;'s overloaded &quot;-x&quot; and &quot;-X&quot; operators did not give the correct results for directories or executable files when running as root. They had been treating executable permissions for root just like for any other user, performing group membership tests  <i>etc</i> for files not owned by root. They now follow the correct Unix behaviour - for a directory they are always true, and for a file if any of the three execute permission bits are set then they report that root can execute the file. Perl's builtin &quot;-x&quot; and &quot;-X&quot; operators have always been correct.</dd>

GDBM_File has been upgraded to 1.15.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The undocumented optional fifth parameter to &quot;TIEHASH&quot; has been removed. This was intended to provide control of the callback used by &quot;gdbm*&quot; functions in case of fatal errors (such as filesystem problems), but did not work (and could never have worked). No code on CPAN even attempted to use it. The callback is now always the previous default, &quot;croak&quot;. Problems on some platforms with how the &quot;C&quot; &quot;croak&quot; function is called have also been resolved.</dd>

&quot;hash_unlocked&quot; and &quot;hashref_unlocked&quot; now returns true if the hash is unlocked, instead of always returning false [perl #112126].<div style="height: 1.00em;">

&quot;hash_unlocked&quot;, &quot;hashref_unlocked&quot;, &quot;lock_hash_recurse&quot; and &quot;unlock_hash_recurse&quot; are now exportable [perl #112126].<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Two new functions, &quot;hash_locked&quot; and &quot;hashref_locked&quot;, have been added. Oddly enough, these two functions were already exported, even though they did not exist [perl #112126].</dd>

The &quot;open3()&quot; function no longer uses &quot;POSIX::close()&quot; to close file descriptors since that breaks the ref-counting of file descriptors done by PerlIO in cases where the file descriptors are shared by PerlIO streams, leading to attempts to close the file descriptors a second time when any such PerlIO streams are closed later on.</dd>

Restricted hashes were not always thawed correctly [perl #73972].<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Storable would croak when freezing a blessed REF object with a &quot;STORABLE_freeze()&quot; method [perl #113880].<div style="height: 1.00em;">

It can now freeze and thaw vstrings correctly.  This causes a slight incompatible change in the storage format, so the format version has increased to 2.9.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Subroutine &quot;&amp;%s&quot; is not available<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently available.  This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the lexical subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.  (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.)  For example,<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \&amp;a } }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current the &quot;a&quot; sub, since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet.  Conversely, the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { my sub a {...} eval 'sub f { \&amp;a }' }-&gt;();<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has gone out of scope, for example,<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub f {<br/>
        my sub a {...}<br/>
        sub { eval '\&amp;a' }<br/>
    }<br/>
    f()-&gt;();<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Here, when the '\&amp;a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being executed, so its &amp;a is not available for capture.</dd>

&quot;%s&quot; subroutine &amp;%s masks earlier declaration in same %s<div style="height: 1.00em;">

(W misc) A &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot; subroutine has been redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error. Note that the earlier subroutine will still exist until the end of the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</dd>

<dd>
$* is no longer supported<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The warning that use of $* and $# is no longer supported is now generated for every location that references them.  Previously it would fail to be generated if another variable using the same typeglob was seen first (e.g. &quot;@*&quot; before $*), and would not be generated for the second and subsequent uses.  (It's hard to fix the failure to generate warnings at all without also generating them every time, and warning every time is consistent with the warnings that $[ used to generate.)</dd>

The warnings for &quot;\b{&quot; and &quot;\B{&quot; were added.  They are a deprecation warning which should be turned off by that category.  One should not have to turn off regular regexp warnings as well to get rid of these.</dd>

The 'Can't use &quot;my %s&quot; in sort comparison' error has been downgraded to a warning, '&quot;my %s&quot; used in sort comparison' (with 'state' instead of 'my' for state variables).  In addition, the heuristics for guessing whether lexical $a or $b has been misused have been improved to generate fewer false positives.  Lexical $a and $b are no longer disallowed if they are outside the sort block.  Also, a named unary or list operator inside the sort block no longer causes the $a or $b to be ignored [perl #86136].</dd>

Added &quot;useversionedarchname&quot; option to Configure<div style="height: 1.00em;">

This feature was requested by Tim Bunce, who observed that &quot;INSTALL_BASE&quot; creates a library structure that does not differentiate by perl version.  Instead, it places architecture specific files in &quot;$install_base/lib/perl5/$archname&quot;.  This makes it difficult to use a common &quot;INSTALL_BASE&quot; library path with multiple versions of perl.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
By setting &quot;-Duseversionedarchname&quot;, the $archname will be distinct for architecture  <i>and</i> API version, allowing mixed use of &quot;INSTALL_BASE&quot;.</dd>

A new op type, &quot;OP_PADRANGE&quot; has been introduced.  The perl peephole optimiser will, where possible, substitute a single padrange op for a pushmark followed by one or more pad ops, and possibly also skipping list and nextstate ops.  In addition, the op can carry out the tasks associated with the RHS of a &quot;my(...) = @_&quot; assignment, so those ops may be optimised away too.</dd>

The new &quot;RXf_MODIFIES_VARS&quot; flag can be set by custom regular expression engines to indicate that the execution of the regular expression may cause variables to be modified.

The APIs for accessing lexical pads have changed considerably.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;PADLIST&quot;s are now longer &quot;AV&quot;s, but their own type instead. &quot;PADLIST&quot;s now contain a &quot;PAD&quot; and a &quot;PADNAMELIST&quot; of &quot;PADNAME&quot;s, rather than &quot;AV&quot;s for the pad and the list of pad names.  &quot;PAD&quot;s, &quot;PADNAMELIST&quot;s, and &quot;PADNAME&quot;s are to be accessed as such through the newly added pad API instead of the plain &quot;AV&quot; and &quot;SV&quot; APIs.  See perlapi for details.</dd>

In the regex API, the numbered capture callbacks are passed an index indicating what match variable is being accessed. There are special index values for the &quot;$`, $&amp;, $&amp;&quot; variables. Previously the same three values were used to retrieve &quot;${^PREMATCH}, ${^MATCH}, ${^POSTMATCH}&quot; too, but these have now been assigned three separate values. See &quot;Numbered capture callbacks&quot; in perlreapi.</dd>

&quot;PL_sawampersand&quot; was previously a boolean indicating that any of &quot;$`, $&amp;, $&amp;&quot; had been seen; it now contains three one-bit flags indicating the presence of each of the variables individually.</dd>

<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;SVf_AMAGIC&quot; flag to indicate overloading is now on the stash, not the object.  It is now set automatically whenever a method or @ISA changes, so its meaning has changed, too.  It now means &quot;potentially overloaded&quot;.  When the overload table is calculated, the flag is automatically turned off if there is no overloading, so there should be no noticeable slowdown.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The staleness of the overload tables is now checked when overload methods are invoked, rather than during &quot;bless&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;A&quot; magic is gone.  The changes to the handling of the &quot;SVf_AMAGIC&quot; flag eliminate the need for it.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;PL_amagic_generation&quot; has been removed as no longer necessary.  For XS modules, it is now a macro alias to &quot;PL_na&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The fallback overload setting is now stored in a stash entry separate from overloadedness itself.</dd>

Under threaded perls, there is no longer a separate PV allocated for every COP to store its package name (&quot;cop-&gt;stashpv&quot;).  Instead, there is an offset (&quot;cop-&gt;stashoff&quot;) into the new &quot;PL_stashpad&quot; array, which holds stash pointers.</dd>

Perl used to implement get magic in a way that would sometimes hide bugs in code that could call  <i>mg_get()</i> too many times on magical values.  This hiding of errors no longer occurs, so long-standing bugs may become visible now.  If you see magic-related errors in XS code, check to make sure it, together with the Perl API functions it uses, calls  <i>mg_get()</i> only once on <i>SvGMAGICAL()</i> values.</dd>

A bug in the core typemap caused any C types that map to the T_BOOL core typemap entry to not be set, updated, or modified when the T_BOOL variable was used in an OUTPUT: section with an exception for RETVAL. T_BOOL in an INPUT: section was not affected. Using a T_BOOL return type for an XSUB (RETVAL) was not affected. A side effect of fixing this bug is, if a T_BOOL is specified in the OUTPUT: section (which previous did nothing to the SV), and a read only SV (literal) is passed to the XSUB, croaks like &quot;Modification of a read-only value attempted&quot; will happen.

For efficiency's sake, many operators and built-in functions return the same scalar each time.

The implementation of code blocks in regular expressions, such as &quot;(?{})&quot; and &quot;(??{})&quot;, has been heavily reworked to eliminate a whole slew of bugs. The main user-visible changes are:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Code blocks within patterns are now parsed in the same pass as the surrounding code; in particular it is no longer necessary to have balanced braces: this now works:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    /(?{  $x='{'  })/<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This means that this error message is no longer generated:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    Sequence (?{...}) not terminated or not {}-balanced in regex<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
but a new error may be seen:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    Sequence (?{...}) not terminated with ')'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In addition, literal code blocks within run-time patterns are only compiled once, at perl compile-time:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    for my $p (...) {<br/>
        # this 'FOO' block of code is compiled once,<br/>
        # at the same time as the surrounding 'for' loop<br/>
        /$p{(?{FOO;})/;<br/>
    }<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Lexical variables are now sane as regards scope, recursion and closure behavior. In particular, &quot;/A(?{B})C/&quot; behaves (from a closure viewpoint) exactly like &quot;/A/ &amp;&amp; do { B } &amp;&amp; /C/&quot;, while  &quot;qr/A(?{B})C/&quot; is like &quot;sub {/A/ &amp;&amp; do { B } &amp;&amp; /C/}&quot;. So this code now works how you might expect, creating three regexes that match 0, 1, and 2:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    for my $i (0..2) {<br/>
        push @r, qr/^(??{$i})$/;<br/>
    }<br/>
    &quot;1&quot; =~ $r[1]; # matches<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;use re 'eval'&quot; pragma is now only required for code blocks defined at runtime; in particular in the following, the text of the $r pattern is still interpolated into the new pattern and recompiled, but the individual compiled code-blocks within $r are reused rather than being recompiled, and &quot;use re 'eval'&quot; isn't needed any more:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $r = qr/abc(?{....})def/;<br/>
    /xyz$r/;<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Flow control operators no longer crash. Each code block runs in a new dynamic scope, so &quot;next&quot; etc. will not see any enclosing loops. &quot;return&quot; returns a value from the code block, not from any enclosing subroutine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl normally caches the compilation of run-time patterns, and doesn't recompile if the pattern hasn't changed, but this is now disabled if required for the correct behavior of closures. For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $code = '(??{$x})';<br/>
    for my $x (1..3) {<br/>
        # recompile to see fresh value of $x each time<br/>
        $x =~ /$code/;<br/>
    }<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;/msix&quot; and &quot;(?msix)&quot; etc. flags are now propagated into the return value from &quot;(??{})&quot;; this now works:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    &quot;AB&quot; =~ /a(??{'b'})/i;<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Warnings and errors will appear to come from the surrounding code (or for run-time code blocks, from an eval) rather than from an &quot;re_eval&quot;:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use re 'eval'; $c = '(?{ warn &quot;foo&quot; })'; /$c/;<br/>
    /(?{ warn &quot;foo&quot; })/;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
formerly gave:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    foo at (re_eval 1) line 1.<br/>
    foo at (re_eval 2) line 1.<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
and now gives:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    foo at (eval 1) line 1.<br/>
    foo at /some/prog line 2.<br/>

&quot;warn&quot;'s handling of magical variables ($1, ties) has undergone several fixes.  &quot;FETCH&quot; is only called once now on a tied argument or a tied $@ [perl #97480].

&quot;warn &quot;&quot;&quot; now treats $@ with a number in it the same way, regardless of whether it happened via &quot;$@=3&quot; or &quot;$@=&quot;3&quot;&quot;.  It used to ignore the former.  Now it appends &quot;\t...caught&quot;, as it has always done with &quot;$@=&quot;3&quot;&quot;.</dd>

Numeric operators on magical variables (e.g., &quot;$1&#160;+&#160;1&quot;) used to use floating point operations even where integer operations were more appropriate, resulting in loss of accuracy on 64-bit platforms [perl #109542].</dd>

Unary negation no longer treats a string as a number if the string happened to be used as a number at some point.  So, if $x contains the string &quot;dogs&quot;, &quot;-$x&quot; returns &quot;-dogs&quot; even if &quot;$y=0+$x&quot; has happened at some point.</dd>

A regression introduced in v5.14.0 has been fixed, in which some calls to the &quot;re&quot; module would clobber $_ [perl #113750].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;do FILE&quot; now always either sets or clears $@, even when the file can't be read. This ensures that testing $@ first (as recommended by the documentation) always returns the correct result.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The array iterator used for the &quot;each @array&quot; construct is now correctly reset when @array is cleared [perl #75596]. This happens, for example, when the array is globally assigned to, as in &quot;@array = (...)&quot;, but not when its  <b>values</b> are assigned to. In terms of the XS API, it means that &quot;av_clear()&quot; will now reset the iterator.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This mirrors the behaviour of the hash iterator when the hash is cleared.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;$class-&gt;can&quot;, &quot;$class-&gt;isa&quot;, and &quot;$class-&gt;DOES&quot; now return correct results, regardless of whether that package referred to by $class exists [perl #47113].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>
Arriving signals no longer clear $@ [perl #45173].</dd>

Allow &quot;my ()&quot; declarations with an empty variable list [perl #113554].</dd>

During parsing, subs declared after errors no longer leave stubs [perl #113712].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Closures containing no string evals no longer hang on to their containing subroutines, allowing variables closed over by outer subroutines to be freed when the outer sub is freed, even if the inner sub still exists [perl #89544].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Duplication of in-memory filehandles by opening with a &quot;&lt;&amp;=&quot; or &quot;&gt;&amp;=&quot; mode stopped working properly in v5.16.0.  It was causing the new handle to reference a different scalar variable.  This has been fixed [perl #113764].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;qr//&quot; expressions no longer crash with custom regular expression engines that do not set &quot;offs&quot; at regular expression compilation time [perl #112962].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;delete local&quot; no longer crashes with certain magical arrays and hashes [perl #112966].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;local&quot; on elements of certain magical arrays and hashes used not to arrange to have the element deleted on scope exit, even if the element did not exist before &quot;local&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;scalar(write)&quot; no longer returns multiple items [perl #73690].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

String to floating point conversions no longer misparse certain strings under &quot;use locale&quot; [perl #109318].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
@INC filters that die no longer leak memory [perl #92252].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The implementations of overloaded operations are now called in the correct context. This allows, among other things, being able to properly override &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; [perl #47119].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Specifying only the &quot;fallback&quot; key when calling &quot;use overload&quot; now behaves properly [perl #113010].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;sub foo { my $a = 0; while ($a) { ... } }&quot; and &quot;sub foo { while (0) { ... } }&quot; now return the same thing [perl #73618].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
String negation now behaves the same under &quot;use integer;&quot; as it does without [perl #113012].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;chr&quot; now returns the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD) for -1, regardless of the internal representation.  -1 used to wrap if the argument was tied or a string internally.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Using a &quot;format&quot; after its enclosing sub was freed could crash as of perl v5.12.0, if the format referenced lexical variables from the outer sub.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Using a &quot;format&quot; after its enclosing sub was undefined could crash as of perl v5.10.0, if the format referenced lexical variables from the outer sub.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Using a &quot;format&quot; defined inside a closure, which format references lexical variables from outside, never really worked unless the &quot;write&quot; call was directly inside the closure.  In v5.10.0 it even started crashing. Now the copy of that closure nearest the top of the call stack is used to find those variables.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Formats that close over variables in special blocks no longer crash if a stub exists with the same name as the special block before the special block is compiled.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The parser no longer gets confused, treating &quot;eval foo ()&quot; as a syntax error if preceded by &quot;print;&quot; [perl #16249].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The return value of &quot;syscall&quot; is no longer truncated on 64-bit platforms [perl #113980].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Constant folding no longer causes &quot;print 1 ? FOO : BAR&quot; to print to the FOO handle [perl #78064].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;do subname&quot; now calls the named subroutine and uses the file name it returns, instead of opening a file named &quot;subname&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Subroutines looked up by rv2cv check hooks (registered by XS modules) are now taken into consideration when determining whether &quot;foo bar&quot; should be the sub call &quot;foo(bar)&quot; or the method call &quot;&quot;bar&quot;-&gt;foo&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;CORE::foo::bar&quot; is no longer treated specially, allowing global overrides to be called directly via &quot;CORE::GLOBAL::uc(...)&quot; [perl #113016].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Calling an undefined sub whose typeglob has been undefined now produces the customary &quot;Undefined subroutine called&quot; error, instead of &quot;Not a CODE reference&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Two bugs involving @ISA have been fixed.  &quot;*ISA = *glob_without_array&quot; and &quot;undef *ISA; @{*ISA}&quot; would prevent future modifications to @ISA from updating the internal caches used to look up methods.  The *glob_without_array case was a regression from Perl v5.12.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Regular expression optimisations sometimes caused &quot;$&quot; with &quot;/m&quot; to produce failed or incorrect matches [perl #114068].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;__SUB__&quot; now works in a &quot;sort&quot; block when the enclosing subroutine is predeclared with &quot;sub foo;&quot; syntax [perl #113710].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Unicode properties only apply to Unicode code points, which leads to some subtleties when regular expressions are matched against above-Unicode code points.  There is a warning generated to draw your attention to this.  However, this warning was being generated inappropriately in some cases, such as when a program was being parsed. Non-Unicode matches such as &quot;\w&quot; and &quot;[:word:]&quot; should not generate the warning, as their definitions don't limit them to apply to only Unicode code points.  Now the message is only generated when matching against &quot;\p{}&quot; and &quot;\P{}&quot;.  There remains a bug, [perl #114148], for the very few properties in Unicode that match just a single code point.  The warning is not generated if they are matched against an above-Unicode code point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Uninitialized warnings mentioning hash elements would only mention the element name if it was not in the first bucket of the hash, due to an off-by-one error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A regular expression optimizer bug could cause multiline &quot;^&quot; to behave incorrectly in the presence of line breaks, such that &quot;&quot;/\n\n&quot; =~ m#\A(?:^/$)#im&quot; would not match [perl #115242].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Failed &quot;fork&quot; in list context no longer corrupts the stack. &quot;@a = (1, 2, fork, 3)&quot; used to gobble up the 2 and assign &quot;(1, undef, 3)&quot; if the &quot;fork&quot; call failed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Numerous memory leaks have been fixed, mostly involving tied variables that die, regular expression character classes and code blocks, and syntax errors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Assigning a regular expression (&quot;${qr//}&quot;) to a variable that happens to hold a floating point number no longer causes assertion failures on debugging builds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Assigning a regular expression to a scalar containing a number no longer causes subsequent numification to produce random numbers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Assigning a regular expression to a magic variable no longer wipes away the magic.  This was a regression from v5.10.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Assigning a regular expression to a blessed scalar no longer results in crashes.  This was also a regression from v5.10.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>
Regular expression can now be assigned to tied hash and array elements with flattening into strings.</dd>

<dd>
Numifying a regular expression no longer results in an uninitialized warning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

Negative array indices no longer cause EXISTS methods of tied variables to be ignored.  This was a regression from v5.12.</dd>

<dd>
Negative array indices no longer result in crashes on arrays tied to non-objects.</dd>
</dl>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;$byte_overload .= $utf8&quot; no longer results in doubly-encoded UTF-8 if the left-hand scalar happened to have produced a UTF-8 string the last time overloading was invoked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;goto &amp;sub&quot; now uses the current value of @_, instead of using the array the subroutine was originally called with.  This means &quot;local @_ = (...); goto &amp;sub&quot; now works [perl #43077].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
If a debugger is invoked recursively, it no longer stomps on its own lexical variables.  Formerly under recursion all calls would share the same set of lexical variables [perl #115742].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
*_{ARRAY} returned from a subroutine no longer spontaneously becomes empty.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When using &quot;say&quot; to print to a tied filehandle, the value of &quot;$\&quot; is correctly localized, even if it was previously undef.  [perl #119927]</dd>

<h1>Obituary</h1> Hojung Yoon (AMORETTE), 24, of Seoul, South Korea, went to his long rest on May 8, 2013 with llama figurine and autographed TIMTOADY card.  He was a brilliant young Perl 5 &amp; 6 hacker and a devoted member of Seoul.pm.  He programmed Perl, talked Perl, ate Perl, and loved Perl.  We believe that he is still programming in Perl with his broken IBM laptop somewhere.  He will be missed.</div>

<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</div>
