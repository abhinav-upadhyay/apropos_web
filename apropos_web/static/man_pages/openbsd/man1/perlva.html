<h1>NAME</h1> perlvar - Perl predefined variables</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>The Syntax of Variable Names</h2> Variable names in Perl can have several formats.  Usually, they must begin with a letter or underscore, in which case they can be arbitrarily long (up to an internal limit of 251 characters) and may contain letters, digits, underscores, or the special sequence &quot;::&quot; or &quot;'&quot;.  In this case, the part before the last &quot;::&quot; or &quot;'&quot; is taken to be a  <i>package qualifier</i>; see perlmod.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl variable names may also be a sequence of digits or a single punctuation or control character (with the literal control character form deprecated).  These names are all reserved for special uses by Perl; for example, the all-digits names are used to hold data captured by backreferences after a regular expression match.  Perl has a special syntax for the single-control-character names: It understands &quot;^X&quot; (caret &quot;X&quot;) to mean the control-&quot;X&quot; character.  For example, the notation $^W (dollar-sign caret &quot;W&quot;) is the scalar variable whose name is the single character control-&quot;W&quot;.  This is better than typing a literal control-&quot;W&quot; into your program.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since Perl v5.6.0, Perl variable names may be alphanumeric strings that begin with control characters (or better yet, a caret). These variables must be written in the form &quot;${^Foo}&quot;; the braces are not optional.  &quot;${^Foo}&quot; denotes the scalar variable whose name is a control-&quot;F&quot; followed by two &quot;o&quot;'s.  These variables are reserved for future special uses by Perl, except for the ones that begin with &quot;^_&quot; (control-underscore or caret-underscore).  No control-character name that begins with &quot;^_&quot; will acquire a special meaning in any future version of Perl; such names may therefore be used safely in programs.  $^_ itself, however,  <i>is</i> reserved.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl identifiers that begin with digits, control characters, or punctuation characters are exempt from the effects of the &quot;package&quot; declaration and are always forced to be in package &quot;main&quot;; they are also exempt from &quot;strict 'vars'&quot; errors.  A few other names are also exempt in these ways:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    ENV      STDIN<br/>
    INC      STDOUT<br/>
    ARGV     STDERR<br/>
    ARGVOUT<br/>
    SIG<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In particular, the special &quot;${^_XYZ}&quot; variables are always taken to be in package &quot;main&quot;, regardless of any &quot;package&quot; declarations presently in scope.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SPECIAL VARIABLES</h1> The following names have special meaning to Perl.  Most punctuation names have reasonable mnemonics, or analogs in the shells. Nevertheless, if you wish to use long variable names, you need only say:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use English;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
at the top of your program.  This aliases all the short names to the long names in the current package.  Some even have medium names, generally borrowed from  <b>awk</b>.  For more info, please see English.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Before you continue, note the sort order for variables.  In general, we first list the variables in case-insensitive, almost-lexigraphical order (ignoring the &quot;{&quot; or &quot;^&quot; preceding words, as in &quot;${^UNICODE}&quot; or $^T), although $_ and @_ move up to the top of the pile. For variables with the same identifier, we list it in order of scalar, array, hash, and bareword.<div class="subsection">
<h2>General Variables</h2><dl>
<dt>
$ARG</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$_</dt>
<dd>
The default input and pattern-searching space.  The following pairs are equivalent:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {...}    # equivalent only in while!<br/>

abs, alarm, chomp, chop, chr, chroot, cos, defined, eval, evalbytes, exp, fc, glob, hex, int, lc, lcfirst, length, log, lstat, mkdir, oct, ord, pos, print, printf, quotemeta, readlink, readpipe, ref, require, reverse (in scalar context only), rmdir, say, sin, split (for its second argument), sqrt, stat, study, uc, ucfirst, unlink, unpack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
All file tests (&quot;-f&quot;, &quot;-d&quot;) except for &quot;-t&quot;, which defaults to STDIN. See &quot;-X&quot; in perlfunc</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The implicit variable of &quot;given()&quot;.</dd>

<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The default place to put the next value or input record when a &quot;&lt;FH&gt;&quot;, &quot;readline&quot;, &quot;readdir&quot; or &quot;each&quot; operation's result is tested by itself as the sole criterion of a &quot;while&quot; test.  Outside a &quot;while&quot; test, this will not happen.</dd>

&#160;</div>
$_ is by default a global variable.  However, as of perl v5.10.0, you can use a lexical version of $_ by declaring it in a file or in a block with &quot;my&quot;.  Moreover, declaring &quot;our $_&quot; restores the global $_ in the current scope.  Though this seemed like a good idea at the time it was introduced, lexical $_ actually causes more problems than it solves.  If you call a function that expects to be passed information via $_, it may or may not work, depending on how the function is written, there not being any easy way to solve this.  Just avoid lexical $_, unless you are feeling particularly masochistic.  For this reason lexical $_ is still experimental and will produce a warning unless warnings have been disabled.  As with other experimental features, the behavior of lexical $_ is subject to change without notice, including change into a fatal error.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: underline is understood in certain operations.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
@ARG</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
@_</dt>
<dd>
Within a subroutine the array @_ contains the parameters passed to that subroutine.  Inside a subroutine, @_ is the default array for the array operators &quot;push&quot;, &quot;pop&quot;, &quot;shift&quot;, and &quot;unshift&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dl>
<dt>
$&quot;</dt>
<dd>
When an array or an array slice is interpolated into a double-quoted string or a similar context such as &quot;/.../&quot;, its elements are separated by this value.  Default is a space.  For example, this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    print &quot;The array is: @array\n&quot;;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
is equivalent to this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    print &quot;The array is: &quot; . join($&quot;, @array) . &quot;\n&quot;;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: works in double-quoted context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$PROCESS_ID</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$PID</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$$</dt>
<dd>
The process number of the Perl running this script.  Though you <i>can</i> set this variable, doing so is generally discouraged, although it can be invaluable for some testing purposes.  It will be reset automatically across &quot;fork()&quot; calls.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note for Linux and Debian GNU/kFreeBSD users: Before Perl v5.16.0 perl would emulate POSIX semantics on Linux systems using LinuxThreads, a partial implementation of POSIX Threads that has since been superseded by the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
LinuxThreads is now obsolete on Linux, and caching &quot;getpid()&quot; like this made embedding perl unnecessarily complex (since you'd have to manually update the value of $$), so now $$ and &quot;getppid()&quot; will always return the same values as the underlying C library.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Debian GNU/kFreeBSD systems also used LinuxThreads up until and including the 6.0 release, but after that moved to FreeBSD thread semantics, which are POSIX-like.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To see if your system is affected by this discrepancy check if &quot;getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION | grep -q NPTL&quot; returns a false value.  NTPL threads preserve the POSIX semantics.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: same as shells.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$PROGRAM_NAME</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$0</dt>
<dd>
Contains the name of the program being executed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On some (but not all) operating systems assigning to $0 modifies the argument area that the &quot;ps&quot; program sees.  On some platforms you may have to use special &quot;ps&quot; options or a different &quot;ps&quot; to see the changes.  Modifying the $0 is more useful as a way of indicating the current program state than it is for hiding the program you're running.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that there are platform-specific limitations on the maximum length of $0.  In the most extreme case it may be limited to the space occupied by the original $0.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In some platforms there may be arbitrary amount of padding, for example space characters, after the modified name as shown by &quot;ps&quot;. In some platforms this padding may extend all the way to the original length of the argument area, no matter what you do (this is the case for example with Linux 2.2).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note for BSD users: setting $0 does not completely remove &quot;perl&quot; from the  <i>ps</i>(1) output.  For example, setting $0 to &quot;foobar&quot; may result in &quot;perl: foobar (perl)&quot; (whether both the &quot;perl: &quot; prefix and the &quot; (perl)&quot; suffix are shown depends on your exact BSD variant and version).  This is an operating system feature, Perl cannot help it.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In multithreaded scripts Perl coordinates the threads so that any thread may modify its copy of the $0 and the change becomes visible to  <i>ps</i>(1) (assuming the operating system plays along).  Note that the view of $0 the other threads have will not change since they have their own copies of it.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the program has been given to perl via the switches &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-E&quot;, $0 will contain the string &quot;-e&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On Linux as of perl v5.14.0 the legacy process name will be set with prctl(2), in addition to altering the POSIX name via &quot;argv[0]&quot; as perl has done since version 4.000.  Now system utilities that read the legacy process name such as ps, top and killall will recognize the name you set when assigning to $0.  The string you supply will be cut off at 16 bytes, this is a limitation imposed by Linux.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: same as <b>sh</b> and <b>ksh</b>.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$(</dt>
<dd>
The real gid of this process.  If you are on a machine that supports membership in multiple groups simultaneously, gives a space separated list of groups you are in.  The first number is the one returned by &quot;getgid()&quot;, and the subsequent ones by &quot;getgroups()&quot;, one of which may be the same as the first number.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
However, a value assigned to $( must be a single number used to set the real gid.  So the value given by $( should  <i>not</i> be assigned back to $( without being forced numeric, such as by adding zero.  Note that this is different to the effective gid ($)) which does take a list.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can change both the real gid and the effective gid at the same time by using &quot;POSIX::setgid()&quot;.  Changes to $( require a check to $! to detect any possible errors after an attempted change.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: parentheses are used to <i>group</i> things.  The real gid is the group you  <i>left</i>, if you're running setgid.</dd>

<dd>
The effective gid of this process.  If you are on a machine that supports membership in multiple groups simultaneously, gives a space separated list of groups you are in.  The first number is the one returned by &quot;getegid()&quot;, and the subsequent ones by &quot;getgroups()&quot;, one of which may be the same as the first number.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Similarly, a value assigned to $) must also be a space-separated list of numbers.  The first number sets the effective gid, and the rest (if any) are passed to &quot;setgroups()&quot;.  To get the effect of an empty list for &quot;setgroups()&quot;, just repeat the new effective gid; that is, to force an effective gid of 5 and an effectively empty &quot;setgroups()&quot; list, say &quot; $) = &quot;5 5&quot; &quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can change both the effective gid and the real gid at the same time by using &quot;POSIX::setgid()&quot; (use only a single numeric argument). Changes to $) require a check to $! to detect any possible errors after an attempted change.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
$&lt;, $&gt;, $( and $) can be set only on machines that support the corresponding  <i>set[re][ug]</i><i>id()</i><i></i> routine.  $( and $) can be swapped only on machines supporting &quot;setregid()&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: parentheses are used to <i>group</i> things.  The effective gid is the group that's  <i>right</i> for you, if you're running setgid.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
$UID</dt>
<dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$&lt;</dt>
<dd>
The real uid of this process.  You can change both the real uid and the effective uid at the same time by using &quot;POSIX::setuid()&quot;.  Since changes to $&lt; require a system call, check $! after a change attempt to detect any possible errors.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: it's the uid you came <i>from</i>, if you're running setuid.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
$&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The effective uid of this process.  For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $&lt; = $&gt;;            # set real to effective uid<br/>
    ($&lt;,$&gt;) = ($&gt;,$&lt;);  # swap real and effective uids<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can change both the effective uid and the real uid at the same time by using &quot;POSIX::setuid()&quot;.  Changes to $&gt; require a check to $! to detect any possible errors after an attempted change.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
$&lt; and $&gt; can be swapped only on machines supporting &quot;setreuid()&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: it's the uid you went <i>to</i>, if you're running setuid.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
$;</dt>
<dd>
The subscript separator for multidimensional array emulation.  If you refer to a hash element as<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $foo{$x,$y,$z}<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
it really means<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $foo{join($;, $x, $y, $z)}<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
But don't put<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    @foo{$x,$y,$z}      # a slice--note the @<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
which means<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    ($foo{$x},$foo{$y},$foo{$z})<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Default is &quot;\034&quot;, the same as SUBSEP in <b>awk</b>.  If your keys contain binary data there might not be any safe value for $;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Consider using &quot;real&quot; multidimensional arrays as described in perllol.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: comma (the syntactic subscript separator) is a semi-semicolon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$a</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$b</dt>
<dd>
Special package variables when using &quot;sort()&quot;, see &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc. Because of this specialness $a and $b don't need to be declared (using &quot;use vars&quot;, or &quot;our()&quot;) even when using the &quot;strict 'vars'&quot; pragma.  Don't lexicalize them with &quot;my $a&quot; or &quot;my $b&quot; if you want to be able to use them in the &quot;sort()&quot; comparison block or function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%ENV</dt>
<dd>
The hash %ENV contains your current environment.  Setting a value in &quot;ENV&quot; changes the environment for any child processes you subsequently &quot;fork()&quot; off.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As of v5.18.0, both keys and values stored in %ENV are stringified.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $foo = 1;<br/>
    $ENV{'bar'} = \$foo;<br/>
    if( ref $ENV{'bar'} ) {<br/>
        say &quot;Pre 5.18.0 Behaviour&quot;;<br/>
    } else {<br/>
        say &quot;Post 5.18.0 Behaviour&quot;;<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Previously, only child processes received stringified values:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $foo = 1;<br/>
    $ENV{'bar'} = \$foo;<br/>
<br/>
    # Always printed 'non ref'<br/>
    system($^X, '-e',<br/>
           q/print ( ref $ENV{'bar'}  ? 'ref' : 'non ref' ) /);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This happens because you can't really share arbitrary data structures with foreign processes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$SYSTEM_FD_MAX</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$^F</dt>
<dd>
The maximum system file descriptor, ordinarily 2.  System file descriptors are passed to &quot;exec()&quot;ed processes, while higher file descriptors are not.  Also, during an &quot;open()&quot;, system file descriptors are preserved even if the &quot;open()&quot; fails (ordinary file descriptors are closed before the &quot;open()&quot; is attempted).  The close-on-exec status of a file descriptor will be decided according to the value of $^F when the corresponding file, pipe, or socket was opened, not the time of the &quot;exec()&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
@F</dt>
<dd>
The array @F contains the fields of each line read in when autosplit mode is turned on.  See perlrun for the  <b>-a</b> switch.  This array is package-specific, and must be declared or given a full package name if not in package main when running under &quot;strict 'vars'&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
@INC</dt>
<dd>
The array @INC contains the list of places that the &quot;do EXPR&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot; constructs look for their library files.  It initially consists of the arguments to any  <b>-I</b> command-line switches, followed by the default Perl library, probably  <i>/usr/local/lib/perl</i>, followed by &quot;.&quot;, to represent the current directory.  (&quot;.&quot; will not be appended if taint checks are enabled, either by &quot;-T&quot; or by &quot;-t&quot;.)  If you need to modify this at runtime, you should use the &quot;use lib&quot; pragma to get the machine-dependent library properly loaded also:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use lib '/mypath/libdir/';<br/>
    use SomeMod;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can also insert hooks into the file inclusion system by putting Perl code directly into @INC.  Those hooks may be subroutine references, array references or blessed objects.  See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%INC</dt>
<dd>
The hash %INC contains entries for each filename included via the &quot;do&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot; operators.  The key is the filename you specified (with module names converted to pathnames), and the value is the location of the file found.  The &quot;require&quot; operator uses this hash to determine whether a particular file has already been included.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the file was loaded via a hook (e.g. a subroutine reference, see &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc for a description of these hooks), this hook is by default inserted into %INC in place of a filename.  Note, however, that the hook may have set the %INC entry by itself to provide some more specific info.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$INPLACE_EDIT</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$^I</dt>
<dd>
The current value of the inplace-edit extension.  Use &quot;undef&quot; to disable inplace editing.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: value of <b>-i</b> switch.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$^M</dt>
<dd>
By default, running out of memory is an untrappable, fatal error. However, if suitably built, Perl can use the contents of $^M as an emergency memory pool after &quot;die()&quot;ing.  Suppose that your Perl were compiled with &quot;-DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK&quot; and used Perl's malloc. Then<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>

<dd>
The name of the operating system under which this copy of Perl was built, as determined during the configuration process.  For examples see &quot;PLATFORMS&quot; in perlport.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The value is identical to $Config{'osname'}.  See also Config and the  <b>-V</b> command-line switch documented in perlrun.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In Windows platforms, $^O is not very helpful: since it is always &quot;MSWin32&quot;, it doesn't tell the difference between 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/CE/.NET.  Use &quot;Win32::GetOSName()&quot; or  <i>Win32::GetOSVersion()</i> (see Win32 and perlport) to distinguish between the variants.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

%SIG</dt>
<dd>
The hash %SIG contains signal handlers for signals.  For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub handler {   # 1st argument is signal name<br/>
        my($sig) = @_;<br/>
        print &quot;Caught a SIG$sig--shutting down\n&quot;;<br/>
        close(LOG);<br/>
        exit(0);<br/>
        }<br/>
<br/>
    $SIG{'INT'}  = \&amp;handler;<br/>
    $SIG{'QUIT'} = \&amp;handler;<br/>
    ...<br/>
    $SIG{'INT'}  = 'DEFAULT';   # restore default action<br/>
    $SIG{'QUIT'} = 'IGNORE';    # ignore SIGQUIT<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Using a value of 'IGNORE' usually has the effect of ignoring the signal, except for the &quot;CHLD&quot; signal.  See perlipc for more about this special case.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Here are some other examples:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = &quot;Plumber&quot;;   # assumes main::Plumber (not<br/>
                                # recommended)<br/>
    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = \&amp;Plumber;   # just fine; assume current<br/>
                                # Plumber<br/>
    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = *Plumber;    # somewhat esoteric<br/>
    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = Plumber();   # oops, what did Plumber()<br/>
                                # return??<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Be sure not to use a bareword as the name of a signal handler, lest you inadvertently call it.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If your system has the &quot;sigaction()&quot; function then signal handlers are installed using it.  This means you get reliable signal handling.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl v5.8.0 from immediate (also known as &quot;unsafe&quot;) to deferred, also known as &quot;safe signals&quot;.  See perlipc for more information.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Certain internal hooks can be also set using the %SIG hash.  The routine indicated by $SIG{__WARN__} is called when a warning message is about to be printed.  The warning message is passed as the first argument.  The presence of a &quot;__WARN__&quot; hook causes the ordinary printing of warnings to &quot;STDERR&quot; to be suppressed.  You can use this to save warnings in a variable, or turn warnings into fatal errors, like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die $_[0] };<br/>
    eval $proggie;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As the 'IGNORE' hook is not supported by &quot;__WARN__&quot;, you can disable warnings using the empty subroutine:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub {};<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The routine indicated by $SIG{__DIE__} is called when a fatal exception is about to be thrown.  The error message is passed as the first argument.  When a &quot;__DIE__&quot; hook routine returns, the exception processing continues as it would have in the absence of the hook, unless the hook routine itself exits via a &quot;goto &amp;sub&quot;, a loop exit, or a &quot;die()&quot;.  The &quot;__DIE__&quot; handler is explicitly disabled during the call, so that you can die from a &quot;__DIE__&quot; handler.  Similarly for &quot;__WARN__&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Due to an implementation glitch, the $SIG{__DIE__} hook is called even inside an &quot;eval()&quot;.  Do not use this to rewrite a pending exception in $@, or as a bizarre substitute for overriding &quot;CORE::GLOBAL::die()&quot;.  This strange action at a distance may be fixed in a future release so that $SIG{__DIE__} is only called if your program is about to exit, as was the original intent.  Any other use is deprecated.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;__DIE__&quot;/&quot;__WARN__&quot; handlers are very special in one respect: they may be called to report (probable) errors found by the parser.  In such a case the parser may be in inconsistent state, so any attempt to evaluate Perl code from such a handler will probably result in a segfault.  This means that warnings or errors that result from parsing Perl should be used with extreme caution, like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    require Carp if defined $^S;<br/>
    Carp::confess(&quot;Something wrong&quot;) if defined &amp;Carp::confess;<br/>
    die &quot;Something wrong, but could not load Carp to give &quot;<br/>
      . &quot;backtrace...\n\t&quot;<br/>
      . &quot;To see backtrace try starting Perl with -MCarp switch&quot;;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Here the first line will load &quot;Carp&quot; <i>unless</i> it is the parser who called the handler.  The second line will print backtrace and die if &quot;Carp&quot; was available.  The third line will be executed only if &quot;Carp&quot; was not available.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Having to even think about the $^S variable in your exception handlers is simply wrong.  $SIG{__DIE__} as currently implemented invites grievous and difficult to track down errors.  Avoid it and use an &quot;END{}&quot; or CORE::GLOBAL::die override instead.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

$^V</dt>
<dd>
The revision, version, and subversion of the Perl interpreter, represented as a &quot;version&quot; object.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This variable first appeared in perl v5.6.0; earlier versions of perl will see an undefined value.  Before perl v5.10.0 $^V was represented as a v-string.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
$^V can be used to determine whether the Perl interpreter executing a script is in the right range of versions.  For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    warn &quot;Hashes not randomized!\n&quot; if !$^V or $^V lt v5.8.1<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To convert $^V into its string representation use &quot;sprintf()&quot;'s &quot;%vd&quot; conversion:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    printf &quot;version is v%vd\n&quot;, $^V;  # Perl's version<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See the documentation of &quot;use VERSION&quot; and &quot;require VERSION&quot; for a convenient way to fail if the running Perl interpreter is too old.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See also $] for an older representation of the Perl version.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>

<dt>
${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}</dt>
<dd>
If this variable is set to a true value, then &quot;stat()&quot; on Windows will not try to open the file.  This means that the link count cannot be determined and file attributes may be out of date if additional hardlinks to the file exist.  On the other hand, not opening the file is considerably faster, especially for files on network drives.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This variable could be set in the <i>sitecustomize.pl</i> file to configure the local Perl installation to use &quot;sloppy&quot; &quot;stat()&quot; by default.  See the documentation for  <b>-f</b> in perlrun for more information about site customization.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

$EXECUTABLE_NAME</dt>

$^X</dt>
<dd>
The name used to execute the current copy of Perl, from C's &quot;argv[0]&quot; or (where supported)  <i>/proc/self/exe</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Depending on the host operating system, the value of $^X may be a relative or absolute pathname of the perl program file, or may be the string used to invoke perl but not the pathname of the perl program file.  Also, most operating systems permit invoking programs that are not in the PATH environment variable, so there is no guarantee that the value of $^X is in PATH.  For VMS, the value may or may not include a version number.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You usually can use the value of $^X to re-invoke an independent copy of the same perl that is currently running, e.g.,<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    @first_run = `$^X -le &quot;print int rand 100 for 1..100&quot;`;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
But recall that not all operating systems support forking or capturing of the output of commands, so this complex statement may not be portable.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It is not safe to use the value of $^X as a path name of a file, as some operating systems that have a mandatory suffix on executable files do not require use of the suffix when invoking a command.  To convert the value of $^X to a path name, use the following statements:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    # Build up a set of file names (not command names).<br/>
    use Config;<br/>
    my $this_perl = $^X;<br/>
    if ($^O ne 'VMS') {<br/>
        $this_perl .= $Config{_exe}<br/>
          unless $this_perl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;<br/>
        }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Because many operating systems permit anyone with read access to the Perl program file to make a copy of it, patch the copy, and then execute the copy, the security-conscious Perl programmer should take care to invoke the installed copy of perl, not the copy referenced by $^X.  The following statements accomplish this goal, and produce a pathname that can be invoked as a command or referenced as a file.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use Config;<br/>
    my $secure_perl_path = $Config{perlpath};<br/>
    if ($^O ne 'VMS') {<br/>
        $secure_perl_path .= $Config{_exe}<br/>
            unless $secure_perl_path =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;<br/>
        }<br/>

<h2>Variables related to regular expressions</h2> Most of the special variables related to regular expressions are side effects.  Perl sets these variables when it has a successful match, so you should check the match result before using them.  For instance:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    if( /P(A)TT(ER)N/ ) {<br/>
        print &quot;I found $1 and $2\n&quot;;<br/>
        }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
These variables are read-only and dynamically-scoped, unless we note otherwise.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The dynamic nature of the regular expression variables means that their value is limited to the block that they are in, as demonstrated by this bit of code:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    my $outer = 'Wallace and Grommit';<br/>
    my $inner = 'Mutt and Jeff';<br/>
<br/>
    my $pattern = qr/(\S+) and (\S+)/;<br/>
<br/>
    sub show_n { print &quot;\$1 is $1; \$2 is $2\n&quot; }<br/>
<br/>
    {<br/>
    OUTER:<br/>
        show_n() if $outer =~ m/$pattern/;<br/>
<br/>
        INNER: {<br/>
            show_n() if $inner =~ m/$pattern/;<br/>
            }<br/>
<br/>
        show_n();<br/>
    }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The output shows that while in the &quot;OUTER&quot; block, the values of $1 and $2 are from the match against $outer.  Inside the &quot;INNER&quot; block, the values of $1 and $2 are from the match against $inner, but only until the end of the block (i.e. the dynamic scope).  After the &quot;INNER&quot; block completes, the values of $1 and $2 return to the values for the match against $outer even though we have not made another match:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit<br/>
    $1 is Mutt; $2 is Jeff<br/>
    $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit<br/>

<i>Performance issues</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Traditionally in Perl, any use of any of the three variables  &quot;$`&quot;, $&amp; or &quot;$'&quot; (or their &quot;use English&quot; equivalents) anywhere in the code, caused all subsequent successful pattern matches to make a copy of the matched string, in case the code might subsequently access one of those variables. This imposed a considerable performance penalty across the whole program, so generally the use of these variables has been discouraged.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In Perl 5.6.0 the &quot;@-&quot; and &quot;@+&quot; dynamic arrays were introduced that supply the indices of successful matches. So you could for example do this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $str =~ /pattern/;<br/>
<br/>
    print $`, $&amp;, $'; # bad: perfomance hit<br/>
<br/>
    print             # good: no perfomance hit<br/>
        substr($str, 0,     $-[0]),<br/>
        substr($str, $-[0], $+[0]-$-[0]),<br/>
        substr($str, $+[0]);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In Perl 5.10.0 the &quot;/p&quot; match operator flag and the &quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;, &quot;${^MATCH}&quot;, and &quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot; variables were introduced, that allowed you to suffer the penalties only on patterns marked with &quot;/p&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In Perl 5.18.0 onwards, perl started noting the presence of each of the three variables separately, and only copied that part of the string required; so in<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $`; $&amp;; &quot;abcdefgh&quot; =~ /d/<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
perl would only copy the &quot;abcd&quot; part of the string. That could make a big difference in something like<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $str = 'x' x 1_000_000;<br/>
    $&amp;; # whoops<br/>
    $str =~ /x/g # one char copied a million times, not a million chars<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In Perl 5.20.0 a new copy-on-write system was enabled by default, which finally fixes all performance issues with these three variables, and makes them safe to use anywhere.<div class="spacer">

This array holds the offsets of the ends of the last successful submatches in the currently active dynamic scope.  $+[0] is the offset into the string of the end of the entire match.  This is the same value as what the &quot;pos&quot; function returns when called on the variable that was matched against.  The  <i>n</i>th element of this array holds the offset of the  <i>n</i>th submatch, so $+[1] is the offset past where $1 ends, $+[2] the offset past where $2 ends, and so on.  You can use $#+ to determine how many subgroups were in the last successful match.  See the examples given for the &quot;@-&quot; variable.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Similar to &quot;@+&quot;, the &quot;%+&quot; hash allows access to the named capture buffers, should they exist, in the last successful match in the currently active dynamic scope.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For example, $+{foo} is equivalent to $1 after the following match:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    'foo' =~ /(?&lt;foo&gt;foo)/;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The keys of the &quot;%+&quot; hash list only the names of buffers that have captured (and that are thus associated to defined values).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The underlying behaviour of &quot;%+&quot; is provided by the Tie::Hash::NamedCapture module.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Note:</b> &quot;%-&quot; and &quot;%+&quot; are tied views into a common internal hash associated with the last successful regular expression.  Therefore mixing iterative access to them via &quot;each&quot; may have unpredictable results. Likewise, if the last successful match changes, then the results may be surprising.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

&quot;$-[0]&quot; is the offset of the start of the last successful match. &quot;$-[&quot; <i>n</i>&quot;]&quot; is the offset of the start of the substring matched by  <i>n</i>-th subpattern, or undef if the subpattern did not match.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Thus, after a match against $_, $&amp; coincides with &quot;substr $_, $-[0], $+[0] - $-[0]&quot;.  Similarly, $ <i>n</i> coincides with &quot;substr $_, $-[n], $+[n] - $-[n]&quot; if &quot;$-[n]&quot; is defined, and $+ coincides with &quot;substr $_, $-[$#-], $+[$#-] - $-[$#-]&quot;.  One can use &quot;$#-&quot; to find the last matched subgroup in the last successful match.  Contrast with $#+, the number of subgroups in the regular expression.  Compare with &quot;@+&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This array holds the offsets of the beginnings of the last successful submatches in the currently active dynamic scope. &quot;$-[0]&quot; is the offset into the string of the beginning of the entire match.  The  <i>n</i>th element of this array holds the offset of the  <i>n</i>th submatch, so &quot;$-[1]&quot; is the offset where $1 begins, &quot;$-[2]&quot; the offset where $2 begins, and so on.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Similar to &quot;%+&quot;, this variable allows access to the named capture groups in the last successful match in the currently active dynamic scope.  To each capture group name found in the regular expression, it associates a reference to an array containing the list of values captured by all buffers with that name (should there be several of them), in the order where they appear.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Variables related to filehandles</h2> Variables that depend on the currently selected filehandle may be set by calling an appropriate object method on the &quot;IO::Handle&quot; object, although this is less efficient than using the regular built-in variables.  (Summary lines below for this contain the word HANDLE.) First you must say<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use IO::Handle;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
after which you may use either<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    method HANDLE EXPR<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
or more safely,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    HANDLE-&gt;method(EXPR)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each method returns the old value of the &quot;IO::Handle&quot; attribute.  The methods each take an optional EXPR, which, if supplied, specifies the new value for the &quot;IO::Handle&quot; attribute in question.  If not supplied, most methods do nothing to the current value--except for &quot;autoflush()&quot;, which will assume a 1 for you, just to be different.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Because loading in the &quot;IO::Handle&quot; class is an expensive operation, you should learn how to use the regular built-in variables.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A few of these variables are considered &quot;read-only&quot;.  This means that if you try to assign to this variable, either directly or indirectly through a reference, you'll raise a run-time exception.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You should be very careful when modifying the default values of most special variables described in this document.  In most cases you want to localize these variables before changing them, since if you don't, the change may affect other modules which rely on the default values of the special variables that you have changed.  This is one of the correct ways to read the whole file at once:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;<br/>
    local $/; # enable localized slurp mode<br/>
    my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;<br/>
    close $fh;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
But the following code is quite bad:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;<br/>
    undef $/; # enable slurp mode<br/>
    my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;<br/>
    close $fh;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
since some other module, may want to read data from some file in the default &quot;line mode&quot;, so if the code we have just presented has been executed, the global value of $/ is now changed for any other code running inside the same Perl interpreter.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Usually when a variable is localized you want to make sure that this change affects the shortest scope possible.  So unless you are already inside some short &quot;{}&quot; block, you should create one yourself.  For example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    my $content = '';<br/>
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;<br/>
    {<br/>
        local $/;<br/>
        $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;<br/>
    }<br/>
    close $fh;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here is an example of how your own code can go broken:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    for ( 1..3 ){<br/>
        $\ = &quot;\r\n&quot;;<br/>
        nasty_break();<br/>
        print &quot;$_&quot;;<br/>
    }<br/>
<br/>
    sub nasty_break {<br/>
        $\ = &quot;\f&quot;;<br/>
        # do something with $_<br/>
    }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You probably expect this code to print the equivalent of<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    &quot;1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n&quot;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
but instead you get:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    &quot;1\f2\f3\f&quot;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Why? Because &quot;nasty_break()&quot; modifies &quot;$\&quot; without localizing it first.  The value you set in  &quot;nasty_break()&quot; is still there when you return.  The fix is to add &quot;local()&quot; so the value doesn't leak out of &quot;nasty_break()&quot;:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    local $\ = &quot;\f&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It's easy to notice the problem in such a short example, but in more complicated code you are looking for trouble if you don't localize changes to the special variables.<dl>
<dt>
$ARGV</dt>
<dd>
Contains the name of the current file when reading from &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
@ARGV</dt>
<dd>
The array @ARGV contains the command-line arguments intended for the script.  $#ARGV is generally the number of arguments minus one, because $ARGV[0] is the first argument,  <i>not</i> the program's command name itself.  See &quot;$0&quot; for the command name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
ARGV </dt>
<dd>
The special filehandle that iterates over command-line filenames in @ARGV.  Usually written as the null filehandle in the angle operator &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;.  Note that currently &quot;ARGV&quot; only has its magical effect within the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator; elsewhere it is just a plain filehandle corresponding to the last file opened by &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;.  In particular, passing &quot;\*ARGV&quot; as a parameter to a function that expects a filehandle may not cause your function to automatically read the contents of all the files in @ARGV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
ARGVOUT </dt>
<dd>
The special filehandle that points to the currently open output file when doing edit-in-place processing with  <b>-i</b>.  Useful when you have to do a lot of inserting and don't want to keep modifying $_.  See perlrun for the  <b>-i</b> switch.</dd>

<dd>
Current line number for the last filehandle accessed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Each filehandle in Perl counts the number of lines that have been read from it.  (Depending on the value of $/, Perl's idea of what constitutes a line may not match yours.)  When a line is read from a filehandle (via &quot;readline()&quot; or &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;), or when &quot;tell()&quot; or &quot;seek()&quot; is called on it, $. becomes an alias to the line counter for that filehandle.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can adjust the counter by assigning to $., but this will not actually move the seek pointer.   <i>Localizing </i><i>$.</i><i> will not localize</i>  <i>the filehandle's line count</i>.  Instead, it will localize perl's notion of which filehandle $. is currently aliased to.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
$. is reset when the filehandle is closed, but <b>not</b> when an open filehandle is reopened without an intervening &quot;close()&quot;.  For more details, see &quot;I/O Operators&quot; in perlop.  Because &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; never does an explicit close, line numbers increase across &quot;ARGV&quot; files (but see examples in &quot;eof&quot; in perlfunc).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can also use &quot;HANDLE-&gt;input_line_number(EXPR)&quot; to access the line counter for a given filehandle without having to worry about which handle you last accessed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>

$RS</dt>

<dl>
<dt>
$/</dt>
<dd>
The input record separator, newline by default.  This influences Perl's idea of what a &quot;line&quot; is.  Works like  <b>awk</b>'s RS variable, including treating empty lines as a terminator if set to the null string (an empty line cannot contain any spaces or tabs).  You may set it to a multi-character string to match a multi-character terminator, or to &quot;undef&quot; to read through the end of file.  Setting it to &quot;\n\n&quot; means something slightly different than setting to &quot;&quot;, if the file contains consecutive empty lines.  Setting to &quot;&quot; will treat two or more consecutive empty lines as a single empty line.  Setting to &quot;\n\n&quot; will blindly assume that the next input character belongs to the next paragraph, even if it's a newline.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    local $/;           # enable &quot;slurp&quot; mode<br/>
    local $_ = &lt;FH&gt;;    # whole file now here<br/>
    s/\n[ \t]+/ /g;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Remember: the value of $/ is a string, not a regex.  <b>awk</b> has to be better for something. :-)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Setting $/ to a reference to an integer, scalar containing an integer, or scalar that's convertible to an integer will attempt to read records instead of lines, with the maximum record size being the referenced integer number of characters.  So this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    local $/ = \32768; # or \&quot;32768&quot;, or \$var_containing_32768<br/>
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $myfile or die $!;<br/>
    local $_ = &lt;$fh&gt;;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
will read a record of no more than 32768 characters from $fh.  If you're not reading from a record-oriented file (or your OS doesn't have record-oriented files), then you'll likely get a full chunk of data with every read.  If a record is larger than the record size you've set, you'll get the record back in pieces.  Trying to set the record size to zero or less is deprecated and will cause $/ to have the value of &quot;undef&quot;, which will cause reading in the (rest of the) whole file.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As of 5.19.9 setting $/ to any other form of reference will throw a fatal exception. This is in preparation for supporting new ways to set $/ in the future.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On VMS only, record reads bypass PerlIO layers and any associated buffering, so you must not mix record and non-record reads on the same filehandle.  Record mode mixes with line mode only when the same buffering layer is in use for both modes.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You cannot call &quot;input_record_separator()&quot; on a handle, only as a static method.  See IO::Handle.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Default is 0 (regardless of whether the channel is really buffered by the system or not; $| tells you only whether you've asked Perl explicitly to flush after each write).  STDOUT will typically be line buffered if output is to the terminal and block buffered otherwise.  Setting this variable is useful primarily when you are outputting to a pipe or socket, such as when you are running a Perl program under  <b>rsh</b> and want to see the output as it's happening.  This has no effect on input buffering.  See &quot;getc&quot; in perlfunc for that.  See &quot;select&quot; in perlfunc on how to select the output channel.

<h2>Error Variables</h2> The variables $@, $!, $^E, and $? contain information about different types of error conditions that may appear during execution of a Perl program.  The variables are shown ordered by the &quot;distance&quot; between the subsystem which reported the error and the Perl process.  They correspond to errors detected by the Perl interpreter, C library, operating system, or an external program, respectively.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To illustrate the differences between these variables, consider the following Perl expression, which uses a single-quoted string.  After execution of this statement, perl may have set all four special error variables:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    eval q{<br/>
        open my $pipe, &quot;/cdrom/install |&quot; or die $!;<br/>
        my @res = &lt;$pipe&gt;;<br/>
        close $pipe or die &quot;bad pipe: $?, $!&quot;;<br/>
    };<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When perl executes the &quot;eval()&quot; expression, it translates the &quot;open()&quot;, &quot;&lt;PIPE&gt;&quot;, and &quot;close&quot; calls in the C run-time library and thence to the operating system kernel.  perl sets $! to the C library's &quot;errno&quot; if one of these calls fails.<div class="spacer">
</div>
$@ is set if the string to be &quot;eval&quot;-ed did not compile (this may happen if &quot;open&quot; or &quot;close&quot; were imported with bad prototypes), or if Perl code executed during evaluation &quot;die()&quot;d.  In these cases the value of $@ is the compile error, or the argument to &quot;die&quot; (which will interpolate $! and $?).  (See also Fatal, though.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Under a few operating systems, $^E may contain a more verbose error indicator, such as in this case, &quot;CDROM tray not closed.&quot;  Systems that do not support extended error messages leave $^E the same as $!.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Finally, $? may be set to non-0 value if the external program  <i>/cdrom/install</i> fails.  The upper eight bits reflect specific error conditions encountered by the program (the program's &quot;exit()&quot; value). The lower eight bits reflect mode of failure, like signal death and core dump information.  See  <i>wait</i>(2) for details.  In contrast to $! and $^E, which are set only if error condition is detected, the variable $? is set on each &quot;wait&quot; or pipe &quot;close&quot;, overwriting the old value.  This is more like $@, which on every &quot;eval()&quot; is always set on failure and cleared on success.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For more details, see the individual descriptions at $@, $!, $^E, and $?.<dl>
<dt>
${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}</dt>
<dd>
The native status returned by the last pipe close, backtick (&quot;``&quot;) command, successful call to &quot;wait()&quot; or &quot;waitpid()&quot;, or from the &quot;system()&quot; operator.  On POSIX-like systems this value can be decoded with the WIFEXITED, WEXITSTATUS, WIFSIGNALED, WTERMSIG, WIFSTOPPED, WSTOPSIG and WIFCONTINUED functions provided by the POSIX module.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Under VMS this reflects the actual VMS exit status; i.e. it is the same as $? when the pragma &quot;use vmsish 'status'&quot; is in effect.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$EXTENDED_OS_ERROR</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$^E</dt>
<dd>
Error information specific to the current operating system.  At the moment, this differs from $! under only VMS, OS/2, and Win32 (and for MacPerl).  On all other platforms, $^E is always just the same as $!.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Under VMS, $^E provides the VMS status value from the last system error.  This is more specific information about the last system error than that provided by $!.  This is particularly important when $! is set to  <b>EVMSERR</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Under OS/2, $^E is set to the error code of the last call to OS/2 API either via CRT, or directly from perl.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Under Win32, $^E always returns the last error information reported by the Win32 call &quot;GetLastError()&quot; which describes the last error from within the Win32 API.  Most Win32-specific code will report errors via $^E.  ANSI C and Unix-like calls set &quot;errno&quot; and so most portable Perl code will report errors via $!.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Caveats mentioned in the description of $! generally apply to $^E, also.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

When referenced, $! retrieves the current value of the C &quot;errno&quot; integer variable. If $! is assigned a numerical value, that value is stored in &quot;errno&quot;. When referenced as a string, $! yields the system error string corresponding to &quot;errno&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Many system or library calls set &quot;errno&quot; if they fail, to indicate the cause of failure.  They usually do  <b>not</b> set &quot;errno&quot; to zero if they succeed.  This means &quot;errno&quot;, hence $!, is meaningful only  <i>immediately</i> after a <b>failure</b>:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    if (open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $filename) {<br/>
                # Here $! is meaningless.<br/>
                ...<br/>
    }<br/>
    else {<br/>
                # ONLY here is $! meaningful.<br/>
                ...<br/>
                # Already here $! might be meaningless.<br/>
    }<br/>
    # Since here we might have either success or failure,<br/>
    # $! is meaningless.<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Here, <i>meaningless</i> means that $! may be unrelated to the outcome of the &quot;open()&quot; operator.  Assignment to $! is similarly ephemeral. It can be used immediately before invoking the &quot;die()&quot; operator, to set the exit value, or to inspect the system error string corresponding to error  <i>n</i>, or to restore $! to a meaningful state.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that when stringified, the text is always returned as if both &quot;use&#160;locale&quot; and &quot;use&#160;bytes&quot; are in effect.  This is likely to change in v5.22.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Each element of &quot;%!&quot; has a true value only if $! is set to that value.  For example, $!{ENOENT} is true if and only if the current value of $! is &quot;ENOENT&quot;; that is, if the most recent error was &quot;No such file or directory&quot; (or its moral equivalent: not all operating systems give that exact error, and certainly not all languages).  To check if a particular key is meaningful on your system, use &quot;exists $!{the_key}&quot;; for a list of legal keys, use &quot;keys %!&quot;.  See Errno for more information, and also see &quot;$!&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dd>
The status returned by the last pipe close, backtick (&quot;``&quot;) command, successful call to &quot;wait()&quot; or &quot;waitpid()&quot;, or from the &quot;system()&quot; operator.  This is just the 16-bit status word returned by the traditional Unix &quot;wait()&quot; system call (or else is made up to look like it).  Thus, the exit value of the subprocess is really (&quot;$? &gt;&gt; 8&quot;), and &quot;$? &amp; 127&quot; gives which signal, if any, the process died from, and &quot;$? &amp; 128&quot; reports whether there was a core dump.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Additionally, if the &quot;h_errno&quot; variable is supported in C, its value is returned via $? if any &quot;gethost*()&quot; function fails.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you have installed a signal handler for &quot;SIGCHLD&quot;, the value of $? will usually be wrong outside that handler.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Inside an &quot;END&quot; subroutine $? contains the value that is going to be given to &quot;exit()&quot;.  You can modify $? in an &quot;END&quot; subroutine to change the exit status of your program.  For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    END {<br/>
        $? = 1 if $? == 255;  # die would make it 255<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Under VMS, the pragma &quot;use vmsish 'status'&quot; makes $? reflect the actual VMS exit status, instead of the default emulation of POSIX status; see &quot;$?&quot; in perlvms for details.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

&#160;</div>
This phase is not called &quot;BEGIN&quot; to avoid confusion with &quot;BEGIN&quot;-blocks, as those are executed during compile-time of any compilation unit, not just the top-level program.  A new, localised compile-time entered at run-time, for example by constructs as &quot;eval &quot;use SomeModule&quot;&quot; are not global interpreter phases, and therefore aren't reflected by &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;.</dd>

$^H</dt>
<dd>
WARNING: This variable is strictly for internal use only.  Its availability, behavior, and contents are subject to change without notice.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This variable contains compile-time hints for the Perl interpreter.  At the end of compilation of a BLOCK the value of this variable is restored to the value when the interpreter started to compile the BLOCK.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When perl begins to parse any block construct that provides a lexical scope (e.g., eval body, required file, subroutine body, loop body, or conditional block), the existing value of $^H is saved, but its value is left unchanged. When the compilation of the block is completed, it regains the saved value. Between the points where its value is saved and restored, code that executes within BEGIN blocks is free to change the value of $^H.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This behavior provides the semantic of lexical scoping, and is used in, for instance, the &quot;use strict&quot; pragma.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The contents should be an integer; different bits of it are used for different pragmatic flags.  Here's an example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub add_100 { $^H |= 0x100 }<br/>
<br/>
    sub foo {<br/>
        BEGIN { add_100() }<br/>
        bar-&gt;baz($boon);<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Consider what happens during execution of the BEGIN block.  At this point the BEGIN block has already been compiled, but the body of &quot;foo()&quot; is still being compiled.  The new value of $^H will therefore be visible only while the body of &quot;foo()&quot; is being compiled.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Substitution of &quot;BEGIN { add_100() }&quot; block with:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    BEGIN { require strict; strict-&gt;import('vars') }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
demonstrates how &quot;use strict 'vars'&quot; is implemented.  Here's a conditional version of the same lexical pragma:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    BEGIN {<br/>
        require strict; strict-&gt;import('vars') if $condition<br/>

<dt>
%^H</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;%^H&quot; hash provides the same scoping semantic as $^H.  This makes it useful for implementation of lexically scoped pragmas.  See perlpragma.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When putting items into &quot;%^H&quot;, in order to avoid conflicting with other users of the hash there is a convention regarding which keys to use. A module should use only keys that begin with the module's name (the name of its main package) and a &quot;/&quot; character.  For example, a module &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; should use keys such as &quot;Foo::Bar/baz&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dl>
<dt>
${^TAINT}</dt>
<dd>
Reflects if taint mode is on or off.  1 for on (the program was run with  <b>-T</b>), 0 for off, -1 when only taint warnings are enabled (i.e. with  <b>-t</b> or <b>-TU</b>).<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dt>
${^UTF8CACHE}</dt>
<dd>
This variable controls the state of the internal UTF-8 offset caching code. 1 for on (the default), 0 for off, -1 to debug the caching code by checking all its results against linear scans, and panicking on any discrepancy.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This variable was added in Perl v5.8.9.  It is subject to change or removal without notice, but is currently used to avoid recalculating the boundaries of multi-byte UTF-8-encoded characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
${^UTF8LOCALE}</dt>
<dd>
This variable indicates whether a UTF-8 locale was detected by perl at startup.  This information is used by perl when it's in adjust-utf8ness-to-locale mode (as when run with the &quot;-CL&quot; command-line switch); see perlrun for more info on this.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Deprecated and removed variables</h2> Deprecating a variable announces the intent of the perl maintainers to eventually remove the variable from the language.  It may still be available despite its status.  Using a deprecated variable triggers a warning.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Once a variable is removed, its use triggers an error telling you the variable is unsupported.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See perldiag for details about error messages.<dl>
<dt>
$#</dt>
<dd>
$# was a variable that could be used to format printed numbers. After a deprecation cycle, its magic was removed in Perl v5.10.0 and using it now triggers a warning: &quot;$# is no longer supported&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is not the sigil you use in front of an array name to get the last index, like $#array.  That's still how you get the last index of an array in Perl.  The two have nothing to do with each other.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

$*</dt>
<dd>
$* was a variable that you could use to enable multiline matching. After a deprecation cycle, its magic was removed in Perl v5.10.0. Using it now triggers a warning: &quot;$* is no longer supported&quot;. You should use the &quot;/s&quot; and &quot;/m&quot; regexp modifiers instead.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Deprecated in Perl 5.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Removed in Perl v5.10.0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
$[</dt>
<dd>
This variable stores the index of the first element in an array, and of the first character in a substring.  The default is 0, but you could theoretically set it to 1 to make Perl behave more like  <b>awk</b> (or Fortran) when subscripting and when evaluating the  <i>index()</i> and <i>substr()</i> functions.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As of release 5 of Perl, assignment to $[ is treated as a compiler directive, and cannot influence the behavior of any other file. (That's why you can only assign compile-time constants to it.) Its use is highly discouraged.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Prior to Perl v5.10.0, assignment to $[ could be seen from outer lexical scopes in the same file, unlike other compile-time directives (such as strict).  Using  <i>local()</i> on it would bind its value strictly to a lexical block.  Now it is always lexically scoped.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As of Perl v5.16.0, it is implemented by the arybase module.  See arybase for more details on its behaviour.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Under &quot;use v5.16&quot;, or &quot;no feature &quot;array_base&quot;&quot;, $[ no longer has any effect, and always contains 0.  Assigning 0 to it is permitted, but any other value will produce an error.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Mnemonic: [ begins subscripts.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

$]</dt>
<dd>
See &quot;$^V&quot; for a more modern representation of the Perl version that allows accurate string comparisons.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The version + patchlevel / 1000 of the Perl interpreter.  This variable can be used to determine whether the Perl interpreter executing a script is in the right range of versions:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<br/>
    warn &quot;No PerlIO!\n&quot; if $] lt '5.008';<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The floating point representation can sometimes lead to inaccurate numeric comparisons, so string comparisons are recommended.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See also the documentation of &quot;use VERSION&quot; and &quot;require VERSION&quot; for a convenient way to fail if the running Perl interpreter is too old.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
