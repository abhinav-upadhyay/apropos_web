<h1>NAME</h1> perl586delta - what is new for perl v5.8.6</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
On Win32, Perl can now use non-IFS compatible LSPs, which allows Perl to work in conjunction with firewalls such as McAfee Guardian. For full details see the file  <i>README.win32</i>, particularly if you're running Win95.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Utility Changes</h1> Perl has a new -dt command-line flag, which enables threads support in the debugger.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Performance Enhancements</h1> &quot;reverse sort ...&quot; is now optimized to sort in reverse, avoiding the generation of a temporary intermediate list.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;for (reverse @foo)&quot; now iterates in reverse, avoiding the generation of a temporary reversed list.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Selected Bug Fixes</h1> The regexp engine is now more robust when given invalid utf8 input, as is sometimes generated by buggy XS modules.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;foreach&quot; on threads::shared array used to be able to crash Perl. This bug has now been fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A regexp in &quot;STDOUT&quot;'s destructor used to coredump, because the regexp pad was already freed. This has been fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;goto &amp;&quot; is now more robust - bugs in deep recursion and chained &quot;goto &amp;&quot; have been fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Using &quot;delete&quot; on an array no longer leaks memory. A &quot;pop&quot; of an item from a shared array reference no longer causes a leak.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;eval_sv()&quot; failing a taint test could corrupt the stack - this has been fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On platforms with 64 bit pointers numeric comparison operators used to erroneously compare the addresses of references that are overloaded, rather than using the overloaded values. This has been fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;read&quot; into a UTF8-encoded buffer with an offset off the end of the buffer no longer mis-calculates buffer lengths.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Although Perl has promised since version 5.8 that &quot;sort()&quot; would be stable, the two cases &quot;sort {$b cmp $a}&quot; and &quot;sort {$b &lt;=&gt; $a}&quot; could produce non-stable sorts.   This is corrected in perl5.8.6.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Localising $^D no longer generates a diagnostic message about valid -D flags.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>New or Changed Diagnostics</h1> For -t and -T,<br/>
   Too late for &quot;-T&quot; option has been changed to the more informative<br/>
   &quot;-T&quot; is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Changed Internals</h1> From now on all applications embedding perl will behave as if perl were compiled with -DPERL_USE_SAFE_PUTENV.  See &quot;Environment access&quot; in the  <i>INSTALL</i> file for details.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Most &quot;C&quot; source files now have comments at the top explaining their purpose, which should help anyone wishing to get an overview of the implementation.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>New Tests</h1> There are significantly more tests for the &quot;B&quot; suite of modules.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://bugs.perl.org.  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.  You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at http://bugs.perl.org/</div>
