<h1>NAME</h1> perl5200delta - what is new for perl v5.20.0</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.18.0 release and the 5.20.0 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read perl5180delta, which describes differences between 5.16.0 and 5.18.0.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Experimental Subroutine signatures</h2> Declarative syntax to unwrap argument list into lexical variables. &quot;sub foo ($a,$b) {...}&quot; checks the number of arguments and puts the arguments into lexical variables.  Signatures are not equivalent to the existing idiom of &quot;sub foo { my($a,$b) = @_; ... }&quot;.  Signatures are only available by enabling a non-default feature, and generate warnings about being experimental.  The syntactic clash with prototypes is managed by disabling the short prototype syntax when signatures are enabled.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;Signatures&quot; in perlsub for details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;sub&quot;s now take a &quot;prototype&quot; attribute</h2> When declaring or defining a &quot;sub&quot;, the prototype can now be specified inside of a &quot;prototype&quot; attribute instead of in parens following the name.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, &quot;sub foo($$){}&quot; could be rewritten as &quot;sub foo : prototype($$){}&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>More consistent prototype parsing</h2> Multiple semicolons in subroutine prototypes have long been tolerated and treated as a single semicolon.  There was one case where this did not happen.  A subroutine whose prototype begins with &quot;*&quot; or &quot;;*&quot; can affect whether a bareword is considered a method name or sub call.  This now applies also to &quot;;;;*&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Whitespace has long been allowed inside subroutine prototypes, so &quot;sub( $ $ )&quot; is equivalent to &quot;sub($$)&quot;, but until now it was stripped when the subroutine was parsed.  Hence, whitespace was  <i>not</i> allowed in prototypes set by &quot;Scalar::Util::set_prototype&quot;.  Now it is permitted, and the parser no longer strips whitespace.  This means &quot;prototype &amp;mysub&quot; returns the original prototype, whitespace and all.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;rand&quot; now uses a consistent random number generator</h2> Previously perl would use a platform specific random number generator, varying between the libc  <i>rand()</i>, <i>random()</i> or <i>drand48()</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This meant that the quality of perl's random numbers would vary from platform to platform, from the 15 bits of  <i>rand()</i> on Windows to 48-bits on POSIX platforms such as Linux with  <i>drand48()</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl now uses its own internal <i>drand48()</i> implementation on all platforms.  This does not make perl's &quot;rand&quot; cryptographically secure.  [perl #115928]</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New slice syntax</h2> The new %hash{...} and %array[...] syntax returns a list of key/value (or index/value) pairs.  See &quot;Key/Value Hash Slices&quot; in perldata.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Experimental Postfix Dereferencing</h2> When the &quot;postderef&quot; feature is in effect, the following syntactical equivalencies are set up:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  $sref-&gt;$*;  # same as ${ $sref }  # interpolates<br/>
  $aref-&gt;@*;  # same as @{ $aref }  # interpolates<br/>
  $href-&gt;%*;  # same as %{ $href }<br/>
  $cref-&gt;&amp;*;  # same as &amp;{ $cref }<br/>
  $gref-&gt;**;  # same as *{ $gref }<br/>
<br/>
  $aref-&gt;$#*; # same as $#{ $aref }<br/>
<br/>
  $gref-&gt;*{ $slot }; # same as *{ $gref }{ $slot }<br/>
<br/>
  $aref-&gt;@[ ... ];  # same as @$aref[ ... ]  # interpolates<br/>
  $href-&gt;@{ ... };  # same as @$href{ ... }  # interpolates<br/>
  $aref-&gt;%[ ... ];  # same as %$aref[ ... ]<br/>
  $href-&gt;%{ ... };  # same as %$href{ ... }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Those marked as interpolating only interpolate if the associated &quot;postderef_qq&quot; feature is also enabled.  This feature is  <b>experimental</b> and will trigger &quot;experimental::postderef&quot;-category warnings when used, unless they are suppressed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For more information, consult the Postfix Dereference Syntax section of perlref.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode 6.3 now supported</h2> Perl now supports and is shipped with Unicode 6.3 (though Perl may be recompiled with any previous Unicode release as well).  A detailed list of Unicode 6.3 changes is at &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.3.0/&gt;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New &quot;\p{Unicode}&quot; regular expression pattern property</h2> This is a synonym for &quot;\p{Any}&quot; and matches the set of Unicode-defined code points 0 - 0x10FFFF.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Better 64-bit support</h2> On 64-bit platforms, the internal array functions now use 64-bit offsets, allowing Perl arrays to hold more than 2**31 elements, if you have the memory available.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The regular expression engine now supports strings longer than 2**31 characters.  [perl #112790, #116907]<div class="spacer">
</div>
The functions PerlIO_get_bufsiz, PerlIO_get_cnt, PerlIO_set_cnt and PerlIO_set_ptrcnt now have SSize_t, rather than int, return values and parameters.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;use&#160;locale&quot; now works on UTF-8 locales</h2> Until this release, only single-byte locales, such as the ISO 8859 series were supported.  Now, the increasingly common multi-byte UTF-8 locales are also supported.  A UTF-8 locale is one in which the character set is Unicode and the encoding is UTF-8.  The POSIX &quot;LC_CTYPE&quot; category operations (case changing (like &quot;lc()&quot;, &quot;\U&quot;), and character classification (&quot;\w&quot;, &quot;\D&quot;, &quot;qr/[[:punct:]]/&quot;)) under such a locale work just as if not under locale, but instead as if under &quot;use&#160;feature&#160;'unicode_strings'&quot;, except taint rules are followed. Sorting remains by code point order in this release.  [perl #56820].</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;use&#160;locale&quot; now compiles on systems without locale ability</h2> Previously doing this caused the program to not compile.  Within its scope the program behaves as if in the &quot;C&quot; locale.  Thus programs written for platforms that support locales can run on locale-less platforms without change.  Attempts to change the locale away from the &quot;C&quot; locale will, of course, fail.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>More locale initialization fallback options</h2> If there was an error with locales during Perl start-up, it immediately gave up and tried to use the &quot;C&quot; locale.  Now it first tries using other locales given by the environment variables, as detailed in &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot; in perllocale.  For example, if &quot;LC_ALL&quot; and &quot;LANG&quot; are both set, and using the &quot;LC_ALL&quot; locale fails, Perl will now try the &quot;LANG&quot; locale, and only if that fails, will it fall back to &quot;C&quot;.  On Windows machines, Perl will try, ahead of using &quot;C&quot;, the system default locale if all the locales given by environment variables fail.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;-DL&quot; runtime option now added for tracing locale setting</h2> This is designed for Perl core developers to aid in field debugging bugs regarding locales.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><b>-F</b> now implies <b>-a</b> and <b>-a</b> implies <b>-n</b></h2> Previously  <b>-F</b> without <b>-a</b> was a no-op, and <b>-a</b> without <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b> was a no-op, with this change, if you supply  <b>-F</b> then both <b>-a</b> and <b>-n</b> are implied and if you supply  <b>-a</b> then <b>-n</b> is implied.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can still use <b>-p</b> for its extra behaviour. [perl #116190]</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>$a and $b warnings exemption</h2> The special variables $a and $b, used in &quot;sort&quot;, are now exempt from &quot;used once&quot; warnings, even where &quot;sort&quot; is not used.  This makes it easier for CPAN modules to provide functions using $a and $b for similar purposes. [perl #120462]</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Security</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Avoid possible read of <i>free()</i>d memory during parsing</h2> It was possible that  <i>free()</i>d memory could be read during parsing in the unusual circumstance of the Perl program ending with a heredoc and the last line of the file on disk having no terminating newline character.  This has now been fixed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;do&quot; can no longer be used to call subroutines</h2> The &quot;do SUBROUTINE(LIST)&quot; form has resulted in a deprecation warning since Perl v5.0.0, and is now a syntax error.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Quote-like escape changes</h2> The character after &quot;\c&quot; in a double-quoted string (&quot;...&quot; or qq(...)) or regular expression must now be a printable character and may not be &quot;{&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A literal &quot;{&quot; after &quot;\B&quot; or &quot;\b&quot; is now fatal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These were deprecated in perl v5.14.0.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Tainting happens under more circumstances; now conforms to documentation</h2> This affects regular expression matching and changing the case of a string (&quot;lc&quot;, &quot;\U&quot;,  <i>etc</i>.) within the scope of &quot;use locale&quot;. The result is now tainted based on the operation, no matter what the contents of the string were, as the documentation (perlsec, &quot;SECURITY&quot; in perllocale) indicates it should.  Previously, for the case change operation, if the string contained no characters whose case change could be affected by the locale, the result would not be tainted. For example, the result of &quot;uc()&quot; on an empty string or one containing only above-Latin1 code points is now tainted, and wasn't before.  This leads to more consistent tainting results.  Regular expression patterns taint their non-binary results (like $&amp;, $2) if and only if the pattern contains elements whose matching depends on the current (potentially tainted) locale.  Like the case changing functions, the actual contents of the string being matched now do not matter, whereas formerly it did.  For example, if the pattern contains a &quot;\w&quot;, the results will be tainted even if the match did not have to use that portion of the pattern to succeed or fail, because what a &quot;\w&quot; matches depends on locale.  However, for example, a &quot;.&quot; in a pattern will not enable tainting, because the dot matches any single character, and what the current locale is doesn't change in any way what matches and what doesn't.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;\p{}&quot;, &quot;\P{}&quot; matching has changed for non-Unicode code points.</h2> &quot;\p{}&quot; and &quot;\P{}&quot; are defined by Unicode only on Unicode-defined code points (&quot;U+0000&quot; through &quot;U+10FFFF&quot;).  Their behavior on matching these legal Unicode code points is unchanged, but there are changes for code points 0x110000 and above.  Previously, Perl treated the result of matching &quot;\p{}&quot; and &quot;\P{}&quot; against these as &quot;undef&quot;, which translates into &quot;false&quot;.  For &quot;\P{}&quot;, this was then complemented into &quot;true&quot;.  A warning was supposed to be raised when this happened. However, various optimizations could prevent the warning, and the results were often counter-intuitive, with both a match and its seeming complement being false.  Now all non-Unicode code points are treated as typical unassigned Unicode code points.  This generally is more Do-What-I-Mean.  A warning is raised only if the results are arguably different from a strict Unicode approach, and from what Perl used to do. Code that needs to be strictly Unicode compliant can make this warning fatal, and then Perl always raises the warning.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Details are in &quot;Beyond Unicode code points&quot; in perlunicode.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;\p{All}&quot; has been expanded to match all possible code points</h2> The Perl-defined regular expression pattern element &quot;\p{All}&quot;, unused on CPAN, used to match just the Unicode code points; now it matches all possible code points; that is, it is equivalent to &quot;qr/./s&quot;.  Thus &quot;\p{All}&quot; is no longer synonymous with &quot;\p{Any}&quot;, which continues to match just the Unicode code points, as Unicode says it should.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Data::Dumper's output may change</h2> Depending on the data structures dumped and the settings set for Data::Dumper, the dumped output may have changed from previous versions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you have tests that depend on the exact output of Data::Dumper, they may fail.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To avoid this problem in your code, test against the data structure from evaluating the dumped structure, instead of the dump itself.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Locale decimal point character no longer leaks outside of &quot;use&#160;locale&quot; scope</h2> This is actually a bug fix, but some code has come to rely on the bug being present, so this change is listed here.  The current locale that the program is running under is not supposed to be visible to Perl code except within the scope of a &quot;use&#160;locale&quot;.  However, until now under certain circumstances, the character used for a decimal point (often a comma) leaked outside the scope.  If your code is affected by this change, simply add a &quot;use&#160;locale&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Assignments of Windows sockets error codes to $! now prefer <i>errno.h</i> values over <i>WSAGetLastError()</i> values</h2> In previous versions of Perl, Windows sockets error codes as returned by  <i>WSAGetLastError()</i> were assigned to $!, and some constants such as ECONNABORTED, not in  <i>errno.h</i> in VC++ (or the various Windows ports of gcc) were defined to corresponding WSAE* values to allow $! to be tested against the E* constants exported by Errno and POSIX.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This worked well until VC++ 2010 and later, which introduced new E* constants with values &gt; 100 into  <i>errno.h</i>, including some being (re)defined by perl to WSAE* values.  That caused problems when linking XS code against other libraries which used the original definitions of  <i>errno.h</i> constants.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To avoid this incompatibility, perl now maps WSAE* error codes to E* values where possible, and assigns those values to $!.  The E* constants exported by Errno and POSIX are updated to match so that testing $! against them, wherever previously possible, will continue to work as expected, and all E* constants found in  <i>errno.h</i> are now exported from those modules with their original  <i>errno.h</i> values.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In order to avoid breakage in existing Perl code which assigns WSAE* values to $!, perl now intercepts the assignment and performs the same mapping to E* values as it uses internally when assigning to $! itself.<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, one backwards-incompatibility remains: existing Perl code which compares $! against the numeric values of the WSAE* error codes that were previously assigned to $! will now be broken in those cases where a corresponding E* value has been assigned instead.  This is only an issue for those E* values &lt; 100, which were always exported from Errno and POSIX with their original  <i>errno.h</i> values, and therefore could not be used for WSAE* error code tests (e.g. WSAEINVAL is 10022, but the corresponding EINVAL is 22).  (E* values &gt; 100, if present, were redefined to WSAE* values anyway, so compatibility can be achieved by using the E* constants, which will work both before and after this change, albeit using different numeric values under the hood.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Functions &quot;PerlIO_vsprintf&quot; and &quot;PerlIO_sprintf&quot; have been removed</h2> These two functions, undocumented, unused in CPAN, and problematic, have been removed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Deprecations</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>The &quot;/\C/&quot; character class</h2> The &quot;/\C/&quot; regular expression character class is deprecated. From perl 5.22 onwards it will generate a warning, and from perl 5.24 onwards it will be a regular expression compiler error. If you need to examine the individual bytes that make up a UTF8-encoded character, then use &quot;utf8::encode()&quot; on the string (or a copy) first.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Literal control characters in variable names</h2> This deprecation affects things like $\cT, where \cT is a literal control (such as a &quot;NAK&quot; or &quot;NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE&quot; character) in the source code.  Surprisingly, it appears that originally this was intended as the canonical way of accessing variables like $^T, with the caret form only being added as an alternative.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The literal control form is being deprecated for two main reasons.  It has what are likely unfixable bugs, such as $\cI not working as an alias for $^I, and their usage not being portable to non-ASCII platforms: While $^T will work everywhere, \cT is whitespace in EBCDIC.  [perl #119123]</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>References to non-integers and non-positive integers in $/</h2> Setting $/ to a reference to zero or a reference to a negative integer is now deprecated, and will behave  <b>exactly</b> as though it was set to &quot;undef&quot;. If you want slurp behavior set $/ to &quot;undef&quot; explicitly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Setting $/ to a reference to a non integer is now forbidden and will throw an error. Perl has never documented what would happen in this context and while it used to behave the same as setting $/ to the address of the references in future it may behave differently, so we have forbidden this usage.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Character matching routines in POSIX</h2> Use of any of these functions in the &quot;POSIX&quot; module is now deprecated: &quot;isalnum&quot;, &quot;isalpha&quot;, &quot;iscntrl&quot;, &quot;isdigit&quot;, &quot;isgraph&quot;, &quot;islower&quot;, &quot;isprint&quot;, &quot;ispunct&quot;, &quot;isspace&quot;, &quot;isupper&quot;, and &quot;isxdigit&quot;.  The functions are buggy and don't work on UTF-8 encoded strings.  See their entries in POSIX for more information.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A warning is raised on the first call to any of them from each place in the code that they are called.  (Hence a repeated statement in a loop will raise just the one warning.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Interpreter-based threads are now <i>discouraged</i></h2> The &quot;interpreter-based threads&quot; provided by Perl are not the fast, lightweight system for multitasking that one might expect or hope for.  Threads are implemented in a way that make them easy to misuse.  Few people know how to use them correctly or will be able to provide help.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The use of interpreter-based threads in perl is officially discouraged.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Module removals</h2> The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN. Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as prerequisites.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The core versions of these modules will now issue &quot;deprecated&quot;-category warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings, install the modules in question from CPAN.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that the planned removal of these modules from core does not reflect a judgement about the quality of the code and should not be taken as a suggestion that their use be halted.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation, not on concerns over their design.<dl>

<h1>Performance Enhancements</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl has a new copy-on-write mechanism that avoids the need to copy the internal string buffer when assigning from one scalar to another. This makes copying large strings appear much faster.  Modifying one of the two (or more) strings after an assignment will force a copy internally. This makes it unnecessary to pass strings by reference for efficiency.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This feature was already available in 5.18.0, but wasn't enabled by default. It is the default now, and so you no longer need build perl with the  <i>Configure</i> argument:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    -Accflags=-DPERL_NEW_COPY_ON_WRITE<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It can be disabled (for now) in a perl build with:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    -Accflags=-DPERL_NO_COW<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On some operating systems Perl can be compiled in such a way that any attempt to modify string buffers shared by multiple SVs will crash.  This way XS authors can test that their modules handle copy-on-write scalars correctly.  See &quot;Copy on Write&quot; in perlguts for detail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl has an optimizer for regular expression patterns.  It analyzes the pattern to find things such as the minimum length a string has to be to match, etc.  It now better handles code points that are above the Latin1 range.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Executing a regex that contains the &quot;^&quot; anchor (or its variant under the &quot;/m&quot; flag) has been made much faster in several situations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Precomputed hash values are now used in more places during method lookup.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Constant hash key lookups ($hash{key} as opposed to $hash{$key}) have long had the internal hash value computed at compile time, to speed up lookup.  This optimisation has only now been applied to hash slices as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Combined &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; operators in void context, like those generated for &quot;unless ($a &amp;&amp; $b)&quot; and &quot;if ($a || b)&quot; now short circuit directly to the end of the statement. [perl #120128]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In certain situations, when &quot;return&quot; is the last statement in a subroutine's main scope, it will be optimized out. This means code like:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  sub baz { return $cat; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
will now behave like:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  sub baz { $cat; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
which is notably faster.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
[perl #120765]</dd>

Code like:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<br/>
  my $x; # or @x, %x<br/>
  my $y;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
is now optimized to:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  my ($x, $y);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In combination with the padrange optimization introduced in v5.18.0, this means longer uninitialized my variable statements are also optimized, so:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  my $x; my @y; my %z;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>

The creation of certain sorts of lists, including array and hash slices, is now faster.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The optimisation for arrays indexed with a small constant integer is now applied for integers in the range -128..127, rather than 0..255. This should speed up Perl code using expressions like $x[-1], at the expense of (presumably much rarer) code using expressions like $x[200].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The first iteration over a large hash (using &quot;keys&quot; or &quot;each&quot;) is now faster. This is achieved by preallocating the hash's internal iterator state, rather than lazily creating it when the hash is first iterated. (For small hashes, the iterator is still created only when first needed. The assumption is that small hashes are more likely to be used as objects, and therefore never allocated. For large hashes, that's less likely to be true, and the cost of allocating the iterator is swamped by the cost of allocating space for the hash itself.)</dd>

Dereferencing (as in &quot;$obj-&gt;[0]&quot; or &quot;$obj-&gt;{k}&quot;) is now faster when $obj is an instance of a class that has overloaded methods, but doesn't overload any of the dereferencing methods &quot;@{}&quot;, &quot;%{}&quot;, and so on.</dd>

The implementation now does a better job of avoiding meaningless work at runtime. Internal effect-free &quot;null&quot; operations (created as a side-effect of parsing Perl programs) are normally deleted during compilation. That deletion is now applied in some situations that weren't previously handled.</dd>

<dd>
Perl now does less disk I/O when dealing with Unicode properties that cover up to three ranges of consecutive code points.</dd>

%s on reference is experimental:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The &quot;auto-deref&quot; feature is experimental.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Starting in v5.14.0, it was possible to use push, pop, keys, and other built-in functions not only on aggregate types, but on references to them.  The feature was not deployed to its original intended specification, and now may become redundant to postfix dereferencing. It has always been categorized as an experimental feature, and in v5.20.0 is carries a warning as such.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Warnings will now be issued at compile time when these operations are detected.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Possible precedence issue with control flow operator<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(W syntax) There is a possible problem with the mixing of a control flow operator (e.g. &quot;return&quot;) and a low-precedence operator like &quot;or&quot;.  Consider:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { return $a or $b; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is parsed as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { (return $a) or $b; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Which is effectively just:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub { return $a; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Either use parentheses or the high-precedence variant of the operator.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note this may be also triggered for constructs like:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Postfix dereference is experimental<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(S experimental::postderef) This warning is emitted if you use the experimental postfix dereference syntax.  Simply suppress the warning if you want to use the feature, but know that in doing so you are taking the risk of using an experimental feature which may change or be removed in a future Perl version:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Prototype '%s' overridden by attribute 'prototype(%s)' in %s<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(W syntax) In scalar context, you've used an array index/value slice (indicated by %) to select a single element of an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $).  The difference is that $foo[&amp;bar] always behaves like a scalar, both in the value it returns and when evaluating its argument, while %foo[&amp;bar] provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things if you're expecting only one subscript.  When called in list context, it also returns the index (what &amp;bar returns) in addition to the value.</dd>

Scalar value @%s{%s} better written as $%s{%s}<div style="height: 1.00em;">

(W syntax) In scalar context, you've used a hash key/value slice (indicated by %) to select a single element of a hash.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $).  The difference is that $foo{&amp;bar} always behaves like a scalar, both in the value it returns and when evaluating its argument, while @foo{&amp;bar} and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things if you're expecting only one subscript.

<dd>
Warnings and errors from the regexp engine are now UTF-8 clean.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;Unknown switch condition&quot; error message has some slight changes.  This error triggers when there is an unknown condition in a &quot;(?(foo))&quot; conditional. The error message used to read:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    Unknown switch condition (?(%s in regex;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
But what %s could be was mostly up to luck.  For &quot;(?(foobar))&quot;, you might have seen &quot;fo&quot; or &quot;f&quot;.  For Unicode characters, you would generally get a corrupted string.  The message has been changed to read:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    Unknown switch condition (?(...)) in regex;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Additionally, the '&lt;-- HERE' marker in the error will now point to the correct spot in the regex.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

The &quot;%s &quot;\x%X&quot; does not map to Unicode&quot; warning is now correctly listed as a severe warning rather than as a fatal error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Under rare circumstances, one could get a &quot;Can't coerce readonly REF to string&quot; instead of the customary &quot;Modification of a read-only value&quot;.  This alternate error message has been removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;Ambiguous use of * resolved as operator *&quot;: This and similar warnings about &quot;%&quot; and &quot;&amp;&quot; used to occur in some circumstances where there was no operator of the type cited, so the warning was completely wrong.  This has been fixed [perl #117535, #76910].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Warnings about malformed subroutine prototypes are now more consistent in how the prototypes are rendered.  Some of these warnings would truncate prototypes containing nulls.  In other cases one warning would suppress another.  The warning about illegal characters in prototypes no longer says &quot;after '_'&quot; if the bad character came before the underscore.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>
Perl folding rules are not up-to-date for 0x%X; please use the perlbug utility to report; in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dd>
%%s[%s] in scalar context better written as $%s[%s]<div style="height: 1.00em;">

This warning now occurs for any %array[$index] or %hash{key} known to be in scalar context at compile time.  Previously it was worded &quot;Scalar value %%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Switch condition not recognized in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The description for this diagnostic has been extended to cover all cases where the warning may occur. Issues with the positioning of the arrow indicator have also been resolved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The error messages for &quot;my($a?$b$c)&quot; and &quot;my(do{})&quot; now mention &quot;conditional expression&quot; and &quot;do block&quot;, respectively, instead of reading 'Can't declare null operation in &quot;my&quot;'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When &quot;use re &quot;debug&quot;&quot; executes a regex containing a backreference, the debugging output now shows what string is being matched.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The now fatal error message &quot;Character following &quot;\c&quot; must be ASCII&quot; has been reworded as &quot;Character following &quot;\c&quot; must be printable ASCII&quot; to emphasize that in &quot;\c <i>X</i>&quot;, <i>X</i> must be a <i>printable (non-control)</i> ASCII character.</dd>

The <i>Makefile.PL</i> for SDBM_File now generates a better <i>Makefile</i>, which avoids a race condition during parallel makes, which could cause the build to fail.

Where possible, the build now avoids recursive invocations of <i>make</i> when building pure-Perl extensions, without removing any parallelism from the build. Currently around 80 extensions can be processed directly by the  <i>make_ext.pl</i> tool, meaning that 80 invocations of <i>make</i> and 160 invocations of  <i>miniperl</i> are no longer made.</dd>

Distinct library basenames with &quot;d_libname_unique&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When compiling perl with this option, the library files for XS modules are named something &quot;unique&quot; -- for example, Hash/Util/Util.so becomes Hash/Util/PL_Hash__Util.so.  This behavior is similar to what currently happens on VMS, and serves as groundwork for the Android port.</dd>

&quot;sysroot&quot; option to indicate the logical root directory under gcc and clang.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dd>
The cross-compilation model has been renovated. There's several new options, and some backwards-incompatible changes:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
We now build binaries for miniperl and generate_uudmap to be used on the host, rather than running every miniperl call on the target; this means that, short of 'make test', we no longer need access to the target system once Configure is done.  You can provide already-built binaries through the &quot;hostperl&quot; and &quot;hostgenerate&quot; options to Configure.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Additionally, if targeting an EBCDIC platform from an ASCII host, or viceversa, you'll need to run Configure with &quot;-Uhostgenerate&quot;, to indicate that generate_uudmap should be run on the target.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Finally, there's also a way of having Configure end early, right after building the host binaries, by cross-compiling without specifying a &quot;targethost&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The incompatible changes include no longer using xconfig.h, xlib, or Cross.pm, so canned config files and Makefiles will have to be updated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Related to the above, there is now a way of specifying the location of sh (or equivalent) on the target system: &quot;targetsh&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For example, Android has its sh in /system/bin/sh, so if cross-compiling from a more normal Unixy system with sh in /bin/sh, &quot;targetsh&quot; would end up as /system/bin/sh, and &quot;sh&quot; as /bin/sh.</dd>

By default, <b>gcc</b> 4.9 does some optimizations that break perl.

Perl 5.004 added support to use the native API of &quot;sfio&quot;, AT&amp;T's Safe/Fast I/O library. This code still built with v5.8.0, albeit with many regression tests failing, but was inadvertently broken before the v5.8.1 release, meaning that it has not worked on any version of Perl released since then.

On a perl built without pseudo-fork (pseudo-fork builds were not affected by this bug), killing a process tree with &quot;kill()&quot; and a negative signal resulted in &quot;kill()&quot; inverting the returned value.  For example, if &quot;kill()&quot; killed 1 process tree PID then it returned 0 instead of 1, and if &quot;kill()&quot; was passed 2 invalid PIDs then it returned 2 instead of 0.  This has probably been the case since the process tree kill feature was implemented on Win32.  It has now been corrected to follow the documented behaviour.

It is now possible to keep Perl from initializing locale handling. For the most part, Perl doesn't pay attention to locale.  (See perllocale.)  Nonetheless, until now, on startup, it has always initialized locale handling to the system default, just in case the program being executed ends up using locales.  (This is one of the first things a locale-aware program should do, long before Perl knows if it will actually be needed or not.)  This works well except when Perl is embedded in another application which wants a locale that isn't the system default.  Now, if the environment variable &quot;PERL_SKIP_LOCALE_INIT&quot; is set at the time Perl is started, this initialization step is skipped.  Prior to this, on Windows platforms, the only workaround for this deficiency was to use a hacked-up copy of internal Perl code.  Applications that need to use older Perls can discover if the embedded Perl they are using needs the workaround by testing that the C preprocessor symbol &quot;HAS_SKIP_LOCALE_INIT&quot; is not defined.

<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that both scalars share the same PV buffer and have a COW_REFCNT greater than zero.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This means that XS code which wishes to modify the &quot;SvPVX()&quot; buffer of an SV should call &quot;SvPV_force()&quot; or similar first, to ensure a valid (and unshared) buffer, and to call &quot;SvSETMAGIC()&quot; afterwards. This in fact has always been the case (for example hash keys were already copy-on-write); this change just spreads the COW behaviour to a wider variety of SVs.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
One important difference is that before 5.18.0, shared hash-key scalars used to have the &quot;SvREADONLY&quot; flag set; this is no longer the case.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This new behaviour can still be disabled by running <i>Configure</i> with  <b>-Accflags=-DPERL_NO_COW</b>.  This option will probably be removed in Perl 5.22.</dd>

The signature of the &quot;Perl_re_intuit_start()&quot; regex function has changed; the function pointer &quot;intuit&quot; in the regex engine plugin structure has also changed accordingly.

XS code may use various macros to change the case of a character or code point (for example &quot;toLOWER_utf8()&quot;).

The &quot;sv&quot; argument in &quot;sv_2pv_flags&quot; in perlapi, &quot;sv_2iv_flags&quot; in perlapi, &quot;sv_2uv_flags&quot; in perlapi, and &quot;sv_2nv_flags&quot; in perlapi and their older wrappers sv_2pv, sv_2iv, sv_2uv, sv_2nv, is now non-NULL. Passing NULL now will crash. When the non-NULL marker was introduced en masse in 5.9.3 the functions were marked non-NULL, but since the creation of the SV API in 5.0 alpha 2, if NULL was passed, the functions returned 0 or false-type values. The code that supports &quot;sv&quot; argument being non-NULL dates to 5.0 alpha 2 directly, and indirectly to Perl 1.0 (pre 5.0 api). The lack of documentation that the functions accepted a NULL &quot;sv&quot; was corrected in 5.11.0 and between 5.11.0 and 5.19.5 the functions were marked NULLOK. As an optimization the NULLOK code has now been removed, and the functions became non-NULL marked again, because core getter-type macros never pass NULL to these functions and would crash before ever passing NULL.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The only way a NULL &quot;sv&quot; can be passed to sv_2*v* functions is if XS code directly calls sv_2*v*. This is unlikely as XS code uses Sv*V* macros to get the underlying value out of the SV. One possible situation which leads to a NULL &quot;sv&quot; being passed to sv_2*v* functions, is if XS code defines its own getter type Sv*V* macros, which check for NULL  <b>before</b> dereferencing and checking the SV's flags through public API Sv*OK* macros or directly using private API &quot;SvFLAGS&quot;, and if &quot;sv&quot; is NULL, then calling the sv_2*v functions with a NULL litteral or passing the &quot;sv&quot; containing a NULL value.</dd>

Changes in warnings raised by &quot;utf8n_to_uvchr()&quot;<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This bottom level function decodes the first character of a UTF-8 string into a code point.  It is accessible to &quot;XS&quot; level code, but it's discouraged from using it directly.  There are higher level functions that call this that should be used instead, such as &quot;utf8_to_uvchr_buf&quot; in perlapi.  For completeness though, this documents some changes to it.  Now, tests for malformations are done before any tests for other potential issues.  One of those issues involves code points so large that they have never appeared in any official standard (the current standard has scaled back the highest acceptable code point from earlier versions).  It is possible (though not done in CPAN) to warn and/or forbid these code points, while accepting smaller code points that are still above the legal Unicode maximum.  The warning message for this now includes the code point if representable on the machine.  Previously it always displayed raw bytes, which is what it still does for non-representable code points.</dd>

There have been several fixes related to Perl's handling of locales.  perl #38193 was described above in &quot;Internal Changes&quot;. Also fixed is #118197, where the radix (decimal point) character had to be an ASCII character (which doesn't work for some non-Western languages); and #115808, in which &quot;POSIX::setlocale()&quot; on failure returned an &quot;undef&quot; which didn't warn about not being defined even if those warnings were enabled.</dd>

Certain uses of the &quot;sort&quot; operator are optimised to modify an array in place, such as &quot;@a = sort @a&quot;.  During the sorting, the array is made read-only.

$a and $b inside a sort block are aliased to the actual arguments to &quot;sort&quot;, so they can be modified through those two variables.  This did not always work, e.g., for lvalue subs and $#ary, and probably many other operators.  It works now.</dd>

&quot;UNIVERSAL::can&quot; now treats its first argument the same way that method calls do: Typeglobs and glob references with non-empty IO slots are treated as handles, and strings are treated as filehandles, rather than packages, if a handle with that name exists [perl #113932].</dd>

Method calls on typeglobs (e.g., &quot;*ARGV-&gt;getline&quot;) used to stringify the typeglob and then look it up again.  Combined with changes in Perl 5.18.0, this allowed &quot;*foo-&gt;bar&quot; to call methods on the &quot;foo&quot; package (like &quot;foo-&gt;bar&quot;).  In some cases it could cause the method to be called on the wrong handle.  Now a typeglob argument is treated as a handle (just like &quot;(\*foo)-&gt;bar&quot;), or, if its IO slot is empty, an error is raised.</dd>

Perl used to leak an implementation detail when it came to referencing the return values of certain operators.  &quot;for ($a+$b) { warn \$_; warn \$_ }&quot; used to display two different memory addresses, because the &quot;\&quot; operator was copying the variable.  Under threaded builds, it would also happen for constants (&quot;for(1) { ... }&quot;).  This has been fixed. [perl #21979, #78194, #89188, #109746, #114838, #115388]</dd>

&quot;readdir()&quot; now only sets $! on error.  $! is no longer set to &quot;EBADF&quot; when then terminating &quot;undef&quot; is read from the directory unless the system call sets $!. [perl #118651]</dd>

Perl 5.18 broke autoloading via &quot;-&gt;SUPER::foo&quot; method calls by looking up AUTOLOAD from the current package rather than the current package's superclass.  This has been fixed. [perl #120694]</dd>

A longstanding bug causing &quot;do {} until CONSTANT&quot;, where the constant holds a true value, to read unallocated memory has been resolved.  This would usually happen after a syntax error.  In past versions of Perl it has crashed intermittently. [perl #72406]</dd>

Fix HP-UX $! failure. HP-UX <i>strerror()</i> returns an empty string for an unknown error code.  This caused an assertion to fail under DEBUGGING builds.  Now instead, the returned string for &quot;$!&quot; contains text indicating the code is for an unknown error.</dd>

Individually-tied elements of @INC (as in &quot;tie $INC[0]...&quot;) are now handled correctly.  Formerly, whether a sub returned by such a tied element would be treated as a sub depended on whether a FETCH had occurred previously.</dd>

<dd>
&quot;getc&quot; on a byte-sized handle after the same &quot;getc&quot; operator had been used on a utf8 handle used to treat the bytes as utf8, resulting in erratic behavior (e.g., malformed UTF-8 warnings).</dd>

An initial &quot;{&quot; at the beginning of a format argument line was always interpreted as the beginning of a block prior to v5.18.  In Perl v5.18, it started being treated as an ambiguous token.  The parser would guess whether it was supposed to be an anonymous hash constructor or a block based on the contents.  Now the previous behavious has been restored. [perl #119973]</dd>

In Perl v5.18 &quot;undef *_; goto &amp;sub&quot; and &quot;local *_; goto &amp;sub&quot; started crashing.  This has been fixed. [perl #119949]</dd>

Backticks (&quot; `` &quot; or &quot; qx// &quot;) combined with multiple threads on Win32 could result in output sent to stdout on one thread being captured by backticks of an external command in another thread.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This could occur for pseudo-forked processes too, as Win32's pseudo-fork is implemented in terms of threads.  [perl #77672]</dd>

&quot;open $fh, &quot;&gt;+&quot;, undef&quot; no longer leaks memory when TMPDIR is set but points to a directory a temporary file cannot be created in.  [perl #120951]</dd>

<h1>Obituary</h1> Diana Rosa, 27, of Rio de Janeiro, went to her long rest on May 10, 2014, along with the plush camel she kept hanging on her computer screen all the time. She was a passionate Perl hacker who loved the language and its community, and who never missed a Rio.pm event. She was a true artist, an enthusiast about writing code, singing arias and graffiting walls. We'll never forget you.<div class="spacer">

Greg McCarroll died on August 28, 2013.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Greg was well known for many good reasons. He was one of the organisers of the first YAPC::Europe, which concluded with an unscheduled auction where he frantically tried to raise extra money to avoid the conference making a loss. It was Greg who mistakenly arrived for a london.pm meeting a week late; some years later he was the one who sold the choice of official meeting date at a YAPC::Europe auction, and eventually as glorious leader of london.pm he got to inherit the irreverent confusion that he had created.<div class="spacer">

Always helpful, friendly and cheerfully optimistic, you will be missed, but never forgotten.</div>

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.<div class="spacer">

<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</div>
