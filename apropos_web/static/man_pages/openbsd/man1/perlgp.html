                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                     Version 1, February 1989<br/>
<br/>
  Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br/>
                     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br/>
<br/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
                            Preamble<br/>
<br/>
   The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users<br/>
 at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public<br/>
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br/>
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The<br/>
 General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's<br/>
 software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.<br/>
 You can use it for your programs, too.<br/>
<br/>
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br/>
 price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make<br/>
 sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free<br/>
 software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,<br/>
 that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free<br/>
 programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br/>
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br/>
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br/>
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br/>
<br/>
   For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether<br/>
 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br/>
 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br/>
 source code.  And you must tell them their rights.<br/>
<br/>
   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br/>
 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br/>
 distribute and/or modify the software.<br/>
<br/>
   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br/>
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br/>
 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br/>
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br/>
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br/>
 authors' reputations.<br/>
<br/>
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>
 modification follow.<br/>
<br/>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/>
<br/>
   0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which<br/>
 contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be<br/>
 distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The<br/>
 &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based<br/>
 on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the<br/>
 Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each<br/>
 licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source<br/>
 code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br/>
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and<br/>
 disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this<br/>
 General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any<br/>
 other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License<br/>
 along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of<br/>
 transferring a copy.<br/>
<br/>
   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of<br/>
 it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph<br/>
 1 above, provided that you also do the following:<br/>
<br/>
     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that<br/>
     you changed the files and the date of any change; and<br/>
<br/>
     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that<br/>
     in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either<br/>
     with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all<br/>
     third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except<br/>
     that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all<br/>
     third parties, at your option).<br/>
<br/>
     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when<br/>
     run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use<br/>
     in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an<br/>
     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice<br/>
     that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a<br/>
     warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these<br/>
     conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General<br/>
     Public License.<br/>
<br/>
     d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a<br/>
     copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in<br/>
     exchange for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
 Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its<br/>
 derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring<br/>
 the other work under the scope of these terms.<br/>
<br/>
   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of<br/>
 it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br/>
 Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br/>
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of<br/>
     Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,<br/>
<br/>
     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br/>
     years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge<br/>
     for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the<br/>
     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of<br/>
     Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,<br/>
<br/>
     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the<br/>
     corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is<br/>
     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br/>
     received the program in object code or executable form alone.)<br/>
<br/>
 Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making<br/>
 modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means<br/>
 all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special<br/>
 exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard<br/>
 libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable<br/>
 file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that<br/>
 accompany that operating system.<br/>
<br/>
   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the<br/>
 Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.<br/>
 Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer<br/>
 the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use<br/>
 the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received<br/>
 copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public<br/>
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties<br/>
 remain in full compliance.<br/>
<br/>
   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based<br/>
 on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,<br/>
 and all its terms and conditions.<br/>
<br/>
   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br/>
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original<br/>
 licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these<br/>
 terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the<br/>
 recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br/>
<br/>
   7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br/>
 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br/>
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br/>
 address new problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br/>
 specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and &quot;any<br/>
 later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br/>
 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br/>
 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br/>
 the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br/>
 Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br/>
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br/>
 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br/>
 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br/>
 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br/>
 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br/>
 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br/>
<br/>
                            NO WARRANTY<br/>
<br/>
   9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br/>
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br/>
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br/>
 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br/>
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br/>
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br/>
 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br/>
 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br/>
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
<br/>
   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br/>
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br/>
 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br/>
 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br/>
 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br/>
 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br/>
 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br/>
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br/>
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br/>
<br/>
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>
 possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br/>
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these<br/>
 terms.<br/>
<br/>
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to<br/>
 attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey<br/>
 the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br/>
 &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br/>
<br/>
     &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br/>
     Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br/>
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br/>
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)<br/>
     any later version.<br/>
<br/>
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br/>
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br/>
     GNU General Public License for more details.<br/>
<br/>
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br/>
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br/>
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA<br/>
     02110-1301 USA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br/>
<br/>
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br/>
 when it starts in an interactive mode:<br/>
<br/>
     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author<br/>
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.<br/>
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br/>
     under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.<br/>
<br/>
 The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the<br/>
 appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the<br/>
 commands you use may be called something other than 'show w' and 'show<br/>
 c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your<br/>
 program.<br/>
<br/>
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br/>
 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if<br/>
 necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:<br/>
<br/>
   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br/>
   program 'Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes<br/>
   at assemblers) written by James Hacker.<br/>
<br/>
