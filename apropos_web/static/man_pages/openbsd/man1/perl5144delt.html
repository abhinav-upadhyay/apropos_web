<h1>NAME</h1> perl5144delta - what is new for perl v5.14.4</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.14.3 release and the 5.14.4 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and 5.14.0.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1> No changes since 5.14.0.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Security</h1> This release contains one major, and medium, and a number of minor security fixes.  The latter are included mainly to allow the test suite to pass cleanly with the clang compiler's address sanitizer facility.<div class="subsection">
<h2>CVE-2013-1667: memory exhaustion with arbitrary hash keys</h2> With a carefully crafted set of hash keys (for example arguments on a URL), it is possible to cause a hash to consume a large amount of memory and CPU, and thus possibly to achieve a Denial-of-Service.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This problem has been fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>memory leak in Encode</h2> The UTF-8 encoding implementation in Encode.xs had a memory leak which has been fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>[perl #111594] Socket::unpack_sockaddr_un heap-buffer-overflow</h2> A read buffer overflow could occur when copying &quot;sockaddr&quot; buffers. Fairly harmless.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This problem has been fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>[perl #111586] SDBM_File: fix off-by-one access to global &quot;.dir&quot;</h2> An extra byte was being copied for some string literals. Fairly harmless.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This problem has been fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>off-by-two error in List::Util</h2> A string literal was being used that included two bytes beyond the end of the string. Fairly harmless.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This problem has been fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>[perl #115994] fix segv in regcomp.<i>c:S_join_exact()</i></h2> Under debugging builds, while marking optimised-out regex nodes as type &quot;OPTIMIZED&quot;, it could treat blocks of exact text as if they were nodes, and thus SEGV. Fairly harmless.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This problem has been fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>[perl #115992] PL_eval_start use-after-free</h2> The statement &quot;local $[;&quot;, when preceded by an &quot;eval&quot;, and when not part of an assignment, could crash. Fairly harmless.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This problem has been fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>wrap-around with IO on long strings</h2> Reading or writing strings greater than 2**31 bytes in size could segfault due to integer wraparound.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This problem has been fixed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1> There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0. If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Deprecations</h1> There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.</div>
<div class="section">

<h2>Platform-Specific Notes</h2><dl>
<dt>
VMS</dt>
<dd>
5.14.3 failed to compile on VMS due to incomplete application of a patch series that allowed &quot;userelocatableinc&quot; and &quot;usesitecustomize&quot; to be used simultaneously.  Other platforms were not affected and the problem has now been corrected.</dd>

</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Selected Bug Fixes</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In Perl 5.14.0, &quot;$tainted ~~ @array&quot; stopped working properly.  Sometimes it would erroneously fail (when $tainted contained a string that occurs in the array  <i>after</i> the first element) or erroneously succeed (when &quot;undef&quot; occurred after the first element) [perl #93590].</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Known Problems</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Acknowledgements</h1> Perl 5.14.4 represents approximately 5 months of development since Perl 5.14.3 and contains approximately 1,700 lines of changes across 49 files from 12 authors.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.14.4:<div class="spacer">
</div>
Andy Dougherty, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Christian Hansen, Craig A. Berry, Dave Rolsky, David Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves, Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Yves Orton.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</div>
