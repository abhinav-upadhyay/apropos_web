<h1>NAME</h1> cvs - Concurrent Versions System</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>cvs</b> [ <i>cvs_options</i> ]</dt>
<dd>
<i>cvs_command</i> [ <i>command_options</i> ] [ <i>command_args</i> ]</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTE</h1> This manpage is a summary of some of the features of <b>cvs</b> but for more in-depth documentation, consult the Cederqvist manual (as described in the SEE ALSO section of this manpage).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.  Unlike the simpler systems, CVS does not just operate on one file at a time or one directory at a time, but operates on hierarchical collections of directories consisting of version controlled files.  CVS helps to manage releases and to control the concurrent editing of source files among multiple authors.  CVS allows triggers to enable/log/control various operations and works well over a wide area network.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>cvs</b> keeps a single copy of the master sources. This copy is called the source ``repository''; it contains all the information to permit extracting previous software releases at any time based on either a symbolic revision tag, or a date in the past.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ESSENTIAL COMMANDS</h1> <b>cvs</b> provides a rich variety of commands ( <i>cvs_command</i> in the Synopsis), each of which often has a wealth of options, to satisfy the many needs of source management in distributed environments.  However, you don't have to master every detail to do useful work with <b>cvs</b>; in fact, five commands are sufficient to use (and contribute to) the source repository.<dl>
<dt>
<b>cvs checkout</b> <i>modules</i>...</dt>
<dd>
A necessary preliminary for most <b>cvs</b> work: creates your private copy of the source for  <i>modules</i> (named collections of source; you can also use a path relative to the source repository here).  You can work with this copy without interfering with others' work.  At least one subdirectory level is always created.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>cvs update</b></dt>
<dd>
Execute this command from <i>within</i> your private source directory when you wish to update your copies of source files from changes that other developers have made to the source in the repository.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>cvs add</b> <i>file</i>...</dt>
<dd>
Use this command to enroll new files in <b>cvs</b> records of your working directory.  The files will be added to the repository the next time you run `<b>cvs commit</b>'. Note: You should use the `<b>cvs import</b>' command to bootstrap new sources into the source repository. `<b>cvs add</b>' is only used for new files to an already checked-out module.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>cvs remove</b> <i>file</i>...</dt>
<dd>
Use this command (after erasing any files listed) to declare that you wish to eliminate files from the repository.  The removal does not affect others until you run `<b>cvs commit</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>cvs commit</b> <i>file</i>...</dt>
<dd>
Use this command when you wish to ``publish'' your changes to other developers, by incorporating them in the source repository.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> The <b>cvs</b> command line can include <i>cvs_options</i>, which apply to the overall <b>cvs</b> program; a <i>cvs_command</i>, which specifies a particular action on the source repository; and <i>command_options</i> and <i>command_arguments</i> to fully specify what the <i>cvs_command</i> will do.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>Warning:</i> you must be careful of precisely where you place options relative to the <i>cvs_command</i>. The same option can mean different things depending on whether it is in the <i>cvs_options</i> position (to the left of a <b>cvs</b> command) or in the <i>command_options</i> position (to the right of a <b>cvs</b> command).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There are only two situations where you may omit <i>cvs_command</i>: `<b>cvs -H</b>' or `<b>cvs --help</b>' elicits a list of available commands, and `<b>cvs -v</b>' or `<b>cvs --version</b>' displays version information on  <b>cvs</b> itself.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CVS OPTIONS</h1> As of release 1.6, <b>cvs</b> supports <small>GNU</small> style long options as well as short options.  Only a few long options are currently supported, these are listed in brackets after the short options whose functions they duplicate.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use these options to control the overall <b>cvs</b> program:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-H [ --help ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Display usage information about the specified <i>cvs_command</i> (but do not actually execute the command).  If you don't specify a command name, `<b>cvs -H</b>' displays a summary of all the commands available.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-R</b></dt>
<dd>
Allows <b>cvs</b> to run properly without write access to its log file. See also the <small>CVSREADONLYFS</small> environment variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-Q</b></dt>
<dd>
Causes the command to be <i>really</i> quiet; the command will generate output only for serious problems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-q</b></dt>
<dd>
Causes the command to be somewhat quiet; informational messages, such as reports of recursion through subdirectories, are suppressed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-b</b> <i>bindir</i></dt>
<dd>
Use <i>bindir</i> as the directory where <small>RCS</small> programs are located (CVS 1.9 and older). Overrides the setting of the <small>RCSBIN</small> environment variable. This value should be specified as an absolute pathname.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-d</b> <i>CVS_root_directory</i></dt>
<dd>
Use <i>CVS_root_directory</i> as the root directory pathname of the master source repository. Overrides the setting of the <small>CVSROOT</small> environment variable. This value should be specified as an absolute pathname.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-e</b> <i>editor</i></dt>
<dd>
Use <i>editor</i> to enter revision log information. Overrides the setting of the <small>CVSEDITOR</small>, <small>VISUAL</small>, and <small>EDITOR</small> environment variables.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-f</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not read the <b>cvs</b> startup file ( <i>~/.cvsrc</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-l</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not log the <i>cvs_command</i> in the command history (but execute it anyway).  See the description of the <b>history</b> command for information on command history.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-n</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not change any files.  Attempt to execute the <i>cvs_command</i>, but only to issue reports; do not remove, update, or merge any existing files, or create any new files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-t</b></dt>
<dd>
Trace program execution; display messages showing the steps of <b>cvs</b> activity.  Particularly useful with <b>-n</b> to explore the potential impact of an unfamiliar command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-r</b></dt>
<dd>
Makes new working files read-only. Same effect as if the <small>CVSREAD</small> environment variable is set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-v [ --version ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Displays version and copyright information for <b>cvs</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-w</b></dt>
<dd>
Makes new working files read-write (default). Overrides the setting of the <small>CVSREAD</small> environment variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-x</b></dt>
<dd>
Encrypt all communication between the client and the server.  As of this writing, this is only implemented when using a Kerberos connection.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-z</b> <i>compression-level</i></dt>
<dd>
When transferring files across the network use <b>gzip</b> compression level  <i>compression-level</i> to compress and de-compress data as it is transferred.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>USAGE</h1> Except when requesting general help with `<b>cvs -H</b>', you must specify a <i>cvs_command</i> to <b>cvs</b> to select a specific release control function to perform. Each <b>cvs</b> command accepts its own collection of options and arguments. However, many options are available across several commands. You can display a usage summary for each command by specifying the <b>-H</b> option with the command.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CVS STARTUP FILE</h1> Normally, when CVS starts up, it reads the <i>.cvsrc</i> file from the home directory of the user reading it.  This startup procedure can be turned off with the <b>-f</b> flag.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <i>.cvsrc</i> file lists CVS commands with a list of arguments, one command per line.  For example, the following line in  <i>.cvsrc</i>:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
diff -c<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
will mean that the `<b>cvs diff</b>' command will always be passed the -c option in addition to any other options that are specified in the command line (in this case it will have the effect of producing context sensitive diffs for all executions of `<b>cvs diff</b>' ).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CVS COMMAND SUMMARY</h1> Here are brief descriptions of all the <b>cvs</b> commands:<dl>
<dt>
<b>add</b></dt>
<dd>
Add a new file or directory to the repository, pending a `<b>cvs commit</b>' on the same file. Can only be done from within sources created by a previous `<b>cvs checkout</b>' invocation. Use `<b>cvs import</b>' to place whole new hierarchies of sources under <b>cvs</b> control. (Does not directly affect repository; changes working directory.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>admin</b></dt>
<dd>
Execute control functions on the source repository.  (Changes repository directly; uses working directory without changing it.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>checkout</b></dt>
<dd>
Make a working directory of source files for editing.  (Creates or changes working directory.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>commit</b></dt>
<dd>
Apply to the source repository changes, additions, and deletions from your working directory.  (Changes repository.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>diff</b></dt>
<dd>
Show differences between files in working directory and source repository, or between two revisions in source repository. (Does not change either repository or working directory.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>export</b></dt>
<dd>
Prepare copies of a set of source files for shipment off site. Differs from `<b>cvs checkout</b>' in that no <b>cvs</b> administrative directories are created (and therefore `<b>cvs commit</b>' cannot be executed from a directory prepared with `<b>cvs export</b>'), and a symbolic tag must be specified. (Does not change repository; creates directory similar to working directories).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>history</b></dt>
<dd>
Show reports on <b>cvs</b> commands that you or others have executed on a particular file or directory in the source repository.  (Does not change repository or working directory.)  History logs are kept only if enabled by creation of the `<b>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history</b>' file; see <b>cvs</b>(<b>5</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>import</b></dt>
<dd>
Incorporate a set of updates from off-site into the source repository, as a ``vendor branch''.  (Changes repository.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>init</b></dt>
<dd>
Initialize a repository by adding the CVSROOT subdirectory and some default control files. You must use this command or initialize the repository in some other way before you can use it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>log</b></dt>
<dd>
Display log information. (Does not change repository or working directory.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>rdiff</b></dt>
<dd>
Prepare a collection of diffs as a patch file between two releases in the repository.  (Does not change repository or working directory.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>release</b></dt>
<dd>
Cancel a `<b>cvs checkout</b>', abandoning any changes. (Can delete working directory; no effect on repository.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>remove</b></dt>
<dd>
Remove files from the source repository, pending a `<b>cvs commit</b>' on the same files.  (Does not directly affect repository; changes working directory.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>rtag</b></dt>
<dd>
Explicitly specify a symbolic tag for particular revisions of files in the source repository.  See also `<b>cvs tag</b>'. (Changes repository directly; does not require or affect working directory.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>status</b></dt>
<dd>
Show current status of files: latest version, version in working directory, whether working version has been edited and, optionally, symbolic tags in the <small>RCS</small> file.  (Does not change repository or working directory.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>tag</b></dt>
<dd>
Specify a symbolic tag for files in the repository.  By default, tags the revisions that were last synchronized with your working directory.   (Changes repository directly; uses working directory without changing it.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>update</b></dt>
<dd>
Bring your working directory up to date with changes from the repository.  Merges are performed automatically when possible; a warning is issued if manual resolution is required for conflicting changes.  (Changes working directory; does not change repository.)</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>COMMON COMMAND OPTIONS</h1> This section describes the <i>command_options</i> that are available across several <b>cvs</b> commands.  Not all commands support all of these options; each option is only supported for commands where it makes sense.  However, when a command has one of these options you can count on the same meaning for the option as in other commands.  (Other command options, which are listed with the individual commands, may have different meanings from one <b>cvs</b> command to another.) <i>Warning:</i> the <b>history</b> command is an exception; it supports many options that conflict even with these standard options.<dl>
<dt>
<b>-D</b> <i>date_spec</i></dt>
<dd>
Use the most recent revision no later than <i>date_spec</i> (a single argument, date description specifying a date in the past).  A wide variety of date formats are supported, in particular ISO (&quot;1972-09-24 20:05&quot;) or Internet (&quot;24 Sep 1972 20:05&quot;). The  <i>date_spec</i> is interpreted as being in the local timezone, unless a specific timezone is specified. The specification is ``sticky'' when you use it to make a private copy of a source file; that is, when you get a working file using  <b>-D</b>, <b>cvs</b> records the date you specified, so that further updates in the same directory will use the same date (unless you explicitly override it; see the description of the  <b>update</b> command). <b>-D</b> is available with the <b>checkout</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>history</b>, <b>export</b>,  <b>rdiff</b>, <b>rtag</b>, and  <b>update</b> commands. Examples of valid date specifications include:<br/>
<br/>
1 month ago<br/>
2 hours ago<br/>
400000 seconds ago<br/>
last year<br/>
last Monday<br/>
yesterday<br/>
a fortnight ago<br/>
3/31/92 10:00:07 PST<br/>
January 23, 1987 10:05pm<br/>
22:00 GMT<br/>
<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-f</b></dt>
<dd>
When you specify a particular date or tag to <b>cvs</b> commands, they normally ignore files that do not contain the tag (or did not exist on the date) that you specified.  Use the  <b>-f</b> option if you want files retrieved even when there is no match for the tag or date.  (The most recent version is used in this situation.) <b>-f</b> is available with these commands: <b>checkout</b>, <b>export</b>,  <b>rdiff</b>, <b>rtag</b>, and <b>update</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-k</b> <i>kflag</i></dt>
<dd>
Alter the default processing of keywords. The  <b>-k</b> option is available with the <b>add</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>export</b>,  <b>rdiff</b>, and <b>update</b> commands.  Your  <i>kflag</i> specification is ``sticky'' when you use it to create a private copy of a source file; that is, when you use this option with the  <b>checkout</b> or <b>update</b> commands,  <b>cvs</b> associates your selected <i>kflag</i> with the file, and continues to use it with future  <b>update</b> commands on the same file until you specify otherwise.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Some of the more useful <i>kflag</i>s are -ko and -kb (for binary files), and -kv which is useful for an <b>export</b> where you wish to retain keyword information after an <b>import</b> at some other site.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-l</b></dt>
<dd>
Local; run only in current working directory, rather than recurring through subdirectories.   Available with the following commands: <b>checkout</b>, <b>commit</b>, <b>diff</b>,  <b>export</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>rdiff</b>, <b>rtag</b>,  <b>status</b>, <b>tag</b>, and <b>update</b>. <i>Warning:</i> this is not the same as the overall `<b>cvs -l</b>' option, which you can specify to the <i>left</i> of a <b>cvs</b> command!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-n</b></dt>
<dd>
Do <i>not</i> run any <b>checkout</b>/<b>commit</b>/<b>tag</b>/<b>update</b> program.  (A program can be specified to run on each of these activities, in the modules database; this option bypasses it.) Available with the <b>checkout</b>, <b>commit</b>, <b>export</b>, and  <b>rtag</b> commands. <i>Warning:</i> this is not the same as the overall `<b>cvs -n</b>' option, which you can specify to the <i>left</i> of a <b>cvs</b> command!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-P</b></dt>
<dd>
Prune (remove) directories that are empty after being updated, on <b>checkout</b>, or <b>update</b>. Normally, an empty directory (one that is void of revision-controlled files) is left alone. Specifying <b>-P</b> will cause these directories to be silently removed from your checked-out sources. This does not remove the directory from the repository, only from your checked out copy. Note that this option is implied by the <b>-r</b> or <b>-D</b> options of <b>checkout</b> and <b>export</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-p</b></dt>
<dd>
Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard output, rather than writing them in the current directory.  Available with the <b>checkout</b> and <b>update</b> commands.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-r</b> <i>tag</i></dt>
<dd>
Use the revision specified by the <i>tag</i> argument instead of the default ``head'' revision.  As well as arbitrary tags defined with the  <b>tag</b> or <b>rtag</b> command, two special tags are always available: `<b>HEAD</b>' refers to the most recent version available in the repository, and `<b>BASE</b>' refers to the revision you last checked out into the current working directory.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <i>tag</i> specification is ``sticky'' when you use this option with `<b>cvs checkout</b>' or `<b>cvs update</b>' to make your own copy of a file:  <b>cvs</b> remembers the <i>tag</i> and continues to use it on future  <b>update</b> commands, until you specify otherwise. <i>tag</i> can be either a symbolic or numeric tag. Specifying the <b>-q</b> global option along with the <b>-r</b> command option is often useful, to suppress the warning messages when the <small>RCS</small> file does not contain the specified tag. <b>-r</b> is available with the <b>checkout</b>, <b>commit</b>, <b>diff</b>,  <b>history</b>, <b>export</b>,  <b>rdiff</b>, <b>rtag</b>, and <b>update</b> commands. <i>Warning:</i> this is not the same as the overall `<b>cvs -r</b>' option, which you can specify to the <i>left</i> of a <b>cvs</b> command!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-t</b> <i>id</i></dt>
<dd>
Expand the RCS identifier specified by the <i>id</i> argument in addition to the default ``Id'' identifier. <b>-t</b> is available with the <b>checkout</b>, <b>export</b>, and <b>update</b> commands.  If the identifier name is specified as ``-'', no additional identifiers will be expanded.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CVS COMMANDS</h1> Here (finally) are details on all the <b>cvs</b> commands and the options each accepts.  The summary lines at the top of each command's description highlight three kinds of things:<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Command Options and Arguments</dt>
<dd>
Special options are described in detail below; common command options may appear only in the summary line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Working Directory, or Repository?</dt>
<dd>
Some <b>cvs</b> commands require a working directory to operate; some require a repository.  Also, some commands  <i>change</i> the repository, some change the working directory, and some change nothing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Synonyms</dt>
<dd>
Many commands have synonyms, which you may find easier to remember (or type) than the principal name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>add</b> [<b>-k</b> <i>kflag</i>] [<b>-m '</b><i>message</i><b>'</b>] <i>files...</i></dt>
<dd>
<i>Requires:</i> repository, working directory.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>Changes:</i> working directory.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>Synonym:</i> <b>new</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use the <b>add</b> command to create a new file or directory in the source repository. The files or directories specified with <b>add</b> must already exist in the current directory (which must have been created with the <b>checkout</b> command). To add a whole new directory hierarchy to the source repository (for example, files received from a third-party vendor), use the `<b>cvs import</b>' command instead.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the argument to `<b>cvs add</b>' refers to an immediate sub-directory, the directory is created at the correct place in the source repository, and the necessary <b>cvs</b> administration files are created in your working directory. If the directory already exists in the source repository, `<b>cvs add</b>' still creates the administration files in your version of the directory. This allows you to use `<b>cvs add</b>' to add a particular directory to your private sources even if someone else created that directory after your <b>checkout</b> of the sources.  You can do the following:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<br/>
example% mkdir new_directory<br/>
example% cvs add new_directory<br/>
example% cvs update new_directory<br/>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An alternate approach using `<b>cvs update</b>' might be:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<br/>
example% cvs update -d new_directory<br/>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(To add <i>any available</i> new directories to your working directory, it's probably simpler to use `<b>cvs checkout</b>' or `<b>cvs update -d</b>'.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The added files are not placed in the source repository until you use `<b>cvs commit</b>' to make the change permanent. Doing a `<b>cvs add</b>' on a file that was removed with the `<b>cvs remove</b>' command will resurrect the file, if no `<b>cvs commit</b>' command intervened.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You will have the opportunity to specify a logging message, as usual, when you use `<b>cvs commit</b>' to make the new file permanent.  If you'd like to have another logging message associated with just <i>creation</i> of the file (for example, to describe the file's purpose), you can specify it with the `<b>-m <i>message</i></b>' option to the <b>add</b> command.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The `<b>-k kflag</b>' option specifies the default way that this file will be checked out. The `<b>kflag</b>' argument is stored in the <small>RCS</small> file and can be changed with `<b>cvs admin</b>'. Specifying `<b>-ko</b>' is useful for checking in binaries that shouldn't have keywords expanded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>admin</b> [<i>rcs-options</i>] <i>files...</i></dt>
<dd>
<i>Requires:</i> repository, working directory.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>Changes:</i> repository.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>Synonym:</i> <b>rcs</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is the <b>cvs</b> interface to assorted administrative facilities, similar to <b>rcs</b>(<b>1</b>). This command works recursively, so extreme care should be used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>checkout</b> [<b>options</b>] <i>modules</i>...</dt>
<dd>
<i>Requires:</i> repository.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>Changes:</i> working directory.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>Synonyms:</i> <b>co</b>, <b>get</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Make a working directory containing copies of the source files specified by <i>modules</i>. You must execute `<b>cvs checkout</b>' before using most of the other <b>cvs</b> commands, since most of them operate on your working directory.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>modules</i> are either symbolic names (themselves defined as the module `<b>modules</b>' in the source repository; see <b>cvs</b>(<b>5</b>)) for some collection of source directories and files, or paths to directories or files in the repository.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Depending on the <i>modules</i> you specify, <b>checkout</b> may recursively create directories and populate them with the appropriate source files. You can then edit these source files at any time (regardless of whether other software developers are editing their own copies of the sources); update them to include new changes applied by others to the source repository; or commit your work as a permanent change to the repository.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that <b>checkout</b> is used to create directories. The top-level directory created is always added to the directory where <b>checkout</b> is invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified <i>module</i>. In the case of a <i>module</i> alias, the created sub-directory may have a different name, but you can be sure that it will be a sub-directory, and that <b>checkout</b> will show the relative path leading to each file as it is extracted into your private work area (unless you specify the <b>-Q</b> global option).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Running `<b>cvs checkout</b>' on a directory that was already built by a prior <b>checkout</b> is also permitted, and has the same effect as specifying the <b>-d</b> option to the <b>update</b> command described below.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <i>options</i> permitted with `<b>cvs checkout</b>' include the standard command options <b>-P</b>, <b>-f</b>,  <b>-k</b><i> kflag</i> , <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-p</b>,  <b>-r</b> <i>tag</i>, and <b>-D</b><i> date</i><b></b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In addition to those, you can use these special command options with <b>checkout</b>:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use the <b>-A</b> option to reset any sticky tags, dates, or <b>-k</b> options.  (If you get a working file using one of the  <b>-r</b>, <b>-D</b>, or <b>-k</b> options, <b>cvs</b> remembers the corresponding tag, date, or  <i>kflag</i> and continues using it on future updates; use the  <b>-A</b> option to make <b>cvs</b> forget these specifications, and retrieve the ``head'' version of the file).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>-j</b><i> branch</i> option merges the changes made between the resulting revision and the revision that it is based on (e.g., if the tag refers to a branch, <b>cvs</b> will merge all changes made in that branch into your working file).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With two <b>-j</b> options, <b>cvs</b> will merge in the changes between the two respective revisions. This can be used to ``remove'' a certain delta from your working file.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In addition, each <b>-j</b> option can contain on optional date specification which, when used with branches, can limit the chosen revision to one within a specific date. An optional date is specified by adding a colon (:) to the tag. An example might be what `<b>cvs import</b>' tells you to do when you have just imported sources that have conflicts with local changes:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<br/>
example% cvs checkout -jTAG:yesterday -jTAG module<br/>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use the <b>-N</b> option with `<b>-d <i>dir</i></b>' to avoid shortening module paths in your working directory.   (Normally,  <b>cvs</b> shortens paths as much as possible when you specify an explicit target directory.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use the <b>-c</b> option to copy the module file, sorted, to the standard output, instead of creating or modifying any files or directories in your working directory.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use the <b>-d</b><i> dir</i> option to create a directory called <i>dir</i> for the working files, instead of using the module name.  Unless you also use  <b>-N</b>, the paths created under <i>dir</i> will be as short as possible.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use the <b>-s</b> option to display per-module status information stored with the <b>-s</b> option within the modules file.</dd>

Use `<b>cvs commit</b>' when you want to incorporate changes from your working source files into the general source repository.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you don't specify particular <i>files</i> to commit, all of the files in your working current directory are examined. <b>commit</b> is careful to change in the repository only those files that you have really changed.  By default (or if you explicitly specify the <b>-R</b> option), files in subdirectories are also examined and committed if they have changed; you can use the <b>-l</b> option to limit <b>commit</b> to the current directory only. Sometimes you may want to force a file to be committed even though it is unchanged; this is achieved with the <b>-f</b> flag, which also has the effect of disabling recursion (you can turn it back on with <b>-R</b> of course).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>commit</b> verifies that the selected files are up to date with the current revisions in the source repository; it will notify you, and exit without committing, if any of the specified files must be made current first with `<b>cvs update</b>'. <b>commit</b> does not call the <b>update</b> command for you, but rather leaves that for you to do when the time is right.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to enter a log message that will be written to one or more logging programs and placed in the source repository file. You can instead specify the log message on the command line with the <b>-m</b> option, thus suppressing the editor invocation, or use the <b>-F</b> option to specify that the argument  <i>file</i> contains the log message.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
At <b>commit</b> a unique commitid is placed in the <small>rcs</small> file inside the repository. All files committed at once get the same commitid. The commitid can be retrieved with the <b>log</b> and <b>status</b> commands.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>-r</b> option can be used to commit to a particular symbolic or numeric revision. For example, to bring all your files up to the revision ``3.0'' (including those that haven't changed), you might do:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<br/>
example% cvs commit -r3.0<br/>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>cvs</b> will only allow you to commit to a revision that is on the main trunk (a revision with a single dot). However, you can also commit to a branch revision (one that has an even number of dots) with the <b>-r</b> option. To create a branch revision, one typically use the <b>-b</b> option of the <b>rtag</b> or <b>tag</b> commands. Then, either <b>checkout</b> or <b>update</b> can be used to base your sources on the newly created branch. From that point on, all <b>commit</b> changes made within these working sources will be automatically added to a branch revision, thereby not perturbing main-line development in any way. For example, if you had to create a patch to the 1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0 version is already under development, you might do:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<br/>
example% cvs rtag -b -rFCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module<br/>

<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Say you have been working on some extremely experimental software, based on whatever revision you happened to checkout last week. If others in your group would like to work on this software with you, but without disturbing main-line development, you could commit your change to a new branch. Others can then checkout your experimental stuff and utilize the full benefit of <b>cvs</b> conflict resolution. The scenario might look like:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<br/>
example% cvs tag -b EXPR1<br/>
example% cvs update -rEXPR1<br/>
[[ hack away ]]<br/>
example% cvs commit<br/>

You can compare your working files with revisions in the source repository, with the `<b>cvs diff</b>' command.  If you don't specify a particular revision, your files are compared with the revisions they were based on.  You can also use the standard <b>cvs</b> command option <b>-r</b> to specify a particular revision to compare your files with.  Finally, if you use <b>-r</b> twice, you can see differences between two revisions in the repository. You can also specify <b>-D</b> options to diff against a revision in the past. The <b>-r</b> and <b>-D</b> options can be mixed together with at most two options ever specified.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See <b>rcsdiff</b>(<b>1</b>) for a list of other accepted options.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you don't specify any files, <b>diff</b> will display differences for all those files in the current directory (and its subdirectories, unless you use the standard option <b>-l</b>) that differ from the corresponding revision in the source repository (i.e. files that <i>you</i> have changed), or that differ from the revision specified.</dd>

This command is a variant of `<b>cvs checkout</b>'; use it when you want a copy of the source for  <i>module</i> without the  <b>cvs</b> administrative directories.  For example, you might use `<b>cvs export</b>' to prepare source for shipment off-site.  This command  <i>requires</i> that you specify a date or tag (with  <b>-D</b> or <b>-r</b>), so that you can count on reproducing the source you ship to others.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The only non-standard options are `<b>-d <i>dir</i></b>' (write the source into directory  <i>dir</i>) and `<b>-N</b>' (don't shorten module paths). These have the same meanings as the same options in `<b>cvs checkout</b>'.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>-kv</b> option is useful when <b>export</b> is used. This causes any keywords to be expanded such that an <b>import</b> done at some other site will not lose the keyword revision information. Other  <i>kflag</i>s may be used with `<b>cvs export</b>' and are described in <b>co</b>(<b>1</b>).</dd>

One of four record types may result from an  <b>update</b>: `W', when the working copy of a file is deleted during update (because it was gone from the repository); `U', when a working file was copied from the repository; `G', when a merge was necessary and it succeeded; and 'C', when a merge was necessary but collisions were detected (requiring manual merging).

&#160;</div>
Use `<b>cvs import</b>' to incorporate an entire source distribution from an outside source (e.g., a source vendor) into your source repository directory.  You can use this command both for initial creation of a repository, and for wholesale updates to the module form the outside source.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <i>repository</i> argument gives a directory name (or a path to a directory) under the CVS root directory for repositories; if the directory did not exist,  <b>import</b> creates it.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When you use <b>import</b> for updates to source that has been modified in your source repository (since a prior  <b>import</b>), it will notify you of any files that conflict in the two branches of development; use `<b>cvs checkout -j</b>' to reconcile the differences, as  <b>import</b> instructs you to do.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
By default, certain file names are ignored during `<b>cvs import</b>': names associated with <small>CVS</small> administration, or with other common source control systems; common names for patch files, object files, archive files, and editor backup files; and other names that are usually artifacts of assorted utilities. For an up to date list of ignored file names, see the Cederqvist manual (as described in the SEE ALSO section of this manpage).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The outside source is saved in a first-level branch, by default `<b>1.1.1</b>'. Updates are leaves of this branch; for example, files from the first imported collection of source will be revision `<b>1.1.1.1</b>', then files from the first imported update will be revision `<b>1.1.1.2</b>', and so on.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
At least three arguments are required.  <i>repository</i> is needed to identify the collection of source.   <i>vendortag</i> is a tag for the entire branch (e.g., for `<b>1.1.1</b>'). You must also specify at least one  <i>releasetag</i> to identify the files at the leaves created each time you execute `<b>cvs import</b>'.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
One of the standard <b>cvs</b> command options is available:  <b>-m</b>  <i>message</i>.  If you do not specify a logging message with  <b>-m</b>, your editor is invoked (as with <b>commit</b>) to allow you to enter one.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There are three additional special options.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use `<b>-d</b>' to specify that each file's time of last modification should be used for the checkin date and time.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use `<b>-b <i>branch</i></b>' to specify a first-level branch other than `<b>1.1.1</b>'.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use `<b>-I <i>name</i></b>' to specify file names that should be ignored during  <b>import</b>.  You can use this option repeatedly. To avoid ignoring any files at all (even those ignored by default), specify `<b>-I !</b>'.</dd>

Builds a Larry Wall format <b>patch</b>(<b>1</b>) file between two releases, that can be fed directly into the <b>patch</b> program to bring an old release up-to-date with the new release. (This is one of the few  <b>cvs</b> commands that operates directly from the repository, and doesn't require a prior <b>checkout</b>.) The diff output is sent to the standard output device. You can specify (using the standard  <b>-r</b> and <b>-D</b> options) any combination of one or two revisions or dates. If only one revision or date is specified, the patch file reflects differences between that revision or date and the current ``head'' revisions in the <small>RCS</small> file.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that if the software release affected is contained in more than one directory, then it may be necessary to specify the <b>-p</b> option to the <b>patch</b> command when patching the old sources, so that <b>patch</b> is able to find the files that are located in other directories.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The standard option <i>flags</i> <b>-f</b>, and <b>-l</b> are available with this command.  There are also several special options flags:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you use the <b>-s</b> option, no patch output is produced. Instead, a summary of the changed or added files between the two releases is sent to the standard output device. This is useful for finding out, for example, which files have changed between two dates or revisions.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you use the <b>-t</b> option, a diff of the top two revisions is sent to the standard output device. This is most useful for seeing what the last change to a file was.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you use the <b>-u</b> option, the patch output uses the newer ``unidiff'' format for context diffs.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can use <b>-c</b> to explicitly specify the `<b>diff -c</b>' form of context diffs (which is the default), if you like.</dd>

&#160;</div>
This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of `<b>cvs checkout</b>'. Since <b>cvs</b> doesn't lock files, it isn't strictly necessary to use this command. You can always simply delete your working directory, if you like; but you risk losing changes you may have forgotten, and you leave no trace in the <b>cvs</b> history file that you've abandoned your checkout.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use `<b>cvs release</b>' to avoid these problems.  This command checks that no un-committed changes are present; that you are executing it from immediately above, or inside, a  <b>cvs</b> working directory; and that the repository recorded for your files is the same as the repository defined in the module database.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If all these conditions are true, `<b>cvs release</b>' leaves a record of its execution (attesting to your intentionally abandoning your checkout) in the <b>cvs</b> history log.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

&#160;</div>
Use this command to declare that you wish to remove <i>files</i> from the source repository.  Like most <b>cvs</b> commands, `<b>cvs remove</b>' works on files in your working directory, not directly on the repository.  As a safeguard, it also requires that you first erase the specified files from your working directory.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The files are not actually removed until you apply your changes to the repository with <b>commit</b>; at that point, the corresponding <small>RCS</small> files in the source repository are <i>moved</i> into the `<b>Attic</b>' directory (also within the source repository).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This command is recursive by default, scheduling all physically removed files that it finds for removal by the next <b>commit</b>. Use the <b>-l</b> option to avoid this recursion, or just specify that actual files that you wish remove to consider.</dd>

&#160;</div>
You can use this command to assign symbolic tags to particular, explicitly specified source versions in the repository. `<b>cvs rtag</b>' works directly on the repository contents (and requires no prior <b>checkout</b>). Use `<b>cvs tag</b>' instead, to base the selection of versions to tag on the contents of your working directory.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In general, tags (often the symbolic names of software distributions) should not be removed, but the <b>-d</b> option is available as a means to remove completely obsolete symbolic names if necessary (as might be the case for an Alpha release, say).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
`<b>cvs rtag</b>' will not move a tag that already exists.  With the  <b>-F</b> option, however, `<b>cvs rtag</b>' will re-locate any instance of  <i>symbolic_tag</i> that already exists on that file to the new repository versions.  Without the  <b>-F</b> option, attempting to use `<b>cvs rtag</b>' to apply a tag that already exists on that file will produce an error message.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>-b</b> option makes the tag a ``branch'' tag, allowing concurrent, isolated development. This is most useful for creating a patch to a previously released software distribution.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can use the standard <b>-r</b> and <b>-D</b> options to tag only those files that already contain a certain tag.  This method would be used to rename a tag: tag only the files identified by the old tag, then delete the old tag, leaving the new tag on exactly the same files as the old tag.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>rtag</b> executes recursively by default, tagging all subdirectories of  <i>modules</i> you specify in the argument.  You can restrict its operation to top-level directories with the standard  <b>-l</b> option; or you can explicitly request recursion with  <b>-R</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The modules database can specify a program to execute whenever a tag is specified; a typical use is to send electronic mail to a group of interested parties.  If you want to bypass that program, use the standard  <b>-n</b> option.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use the <b>-a</b> option to have <b>rtag</b> look in the `<b>Attic</b>' for removed files that contain the specified tag. The tag is removed from these files, which makes it convenient to re-use a symbolic tag as development continues (and files get removed from the up-coming distribution).</dd>

Display a brief report on the current status of <i>files</i> with respect to the source repository, including any ``sticky'' tags, dates, or  <b>-k</b> options.  (``Sticky'' options will restrict how `<b>cvs update</b>' operates until you reset them; see the description of `<b>cvs update -A...</b>'.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can also use this command to anticipate the potential impact of a `<b>cvs update</b>' on your working source directory.  If you do not specify any  <i>files</i> explicitly, reports are shown for all files that  <b>cvs</b> has placed in your working directory.  You can limit the scope of this search to the current directory itself (not its subdirectories) with the standard  <b>-l</b> option flag; or you can explicitly request recursive status reports with the  <b>-R</b> option.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>-v</b> option causes the symbolic tags for the <small>RCS</small> file to be displayed as well.</dd>

<i>Synonym:</i> <b>freeze</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use this command to assign symbolic tags to the nearest repository versions to your working sources.  The tags are applied immediately to the repository, as with  <b>rtag</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
One use for tags is to record a ``snapshot'' of the current sources when the software freeze date of a project arrives.  As bugs are fixed after the freeze date, only those changed sources that are to be part of the release need be re-tagged.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The symbolic tags are meant to permanently record which revisions of which files were used in creating a software distribution. The <b>checkout</b>, <b>export</b> and <b>update</b> commands allow you to extract an exact copy of a tagged release at any time in the future, regardless of whether files have been changed, added, or removed since the release was tagged.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can use the standard <b>-r</b> and <b>-D</b> options to tag only those files that already contain a certain tag.  This method would be used to rename a tag: tag only the files identified by the old tag, then delete the old tag, leaving the new tag on exactly the same files as the old tag.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Specifying the <b>-f</b> flag in addition to the <b>-r</b> or <b>-D</b> flags will tag those files named on the command line even if they do not contain the old tag or did not exist on the specified date.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
By default (without a <b>-r</b> or <b>-D</b> flag) the versions to be tagged are supplied implicitly by the  <b>cvs</b> records of your working files' history rather than applied explicitly.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you use `<b>cvs tag -d <i>symbolic_tag</i>...</b>', the symbolic tag you specify is <i>deleted</i> instead of being added.   <i>Warning</i>: Be very certain of your ground before you delete a tag; doing this effectively discards some historical information, which may later turn out to have been valuable.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
`<b>cvs tag</b>' will not move a tag that already exists.  With the  <b>-F</b> option, however, `<b>cvs tag</b>' will re-locate any instance of  <i>symbolic_tag</i> that already exists on that file to the new repository versions.  Without the  <b>-F</b> option, attempting to use `<b>cvs tag</b>' to apply a tag that already exists on that file will produce an error message.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>-b</b> option makes the tag a ``branch'' tag, allowing concurrent, isolated development. This is most useful for creating a patch to a previously released software distribution.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Normally, <b>tag</b> executes recursively through subdirectories; you can prevent this by using the standard  <b>-l</b> option, or specify the recursion explicitly by using  <b>-R</b>.</dd>

&#160;</div>
After you've run <b>checkout</b> to create your private copy of source from the common repository, other developers will continue changing the central source.  From time to time, when it is convenient in your development process, you can use the <b>update</b> command from within your working directory to reconcile your work with any revisions applied to  the source repository since your last <b>checkout</b> or <b>update</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>update</b> keeps you informed of its progress by printing a line for each file, prefaced with one of the characters `<b>U P A R M C ?</b>' to indicate the status of the file:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>U</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
The file has been brought <i>up to date</i> with respect to the repository. This is done for any file that exists in the repository but not in your source, and for files that you haven't changed but are not the most recent versions available in the repository.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>P</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
As `<b>U</b>', but instead of transferring the entire file a patch containing the required changes were sent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>A</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
The file has been <i>added</i> to your private copy of the sources, and will be added to the source repository when you run `<b>cvs commit</b>' on the file. This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>R</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
The file has been <i>removed</i> from your private copy of the sources, and will be removed from the source repository when you run `<b>cvs commit</b>' on the file. This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>M</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
The file has been <i>modified</i> in your working directory. `<b>M</b>' can indicate one of two states for a file you're working on: either there were no modifications to the same file in the repository, so that your file remains as you last saw it; or there were modifications in the repository as well as in your copy, but they were  <i>merged</i> successfully, without conflict, in your working directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>C</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
A <i>conflict</i> has been detected while trying to merge your changes to  <i>file</i> with changes from the source repository.  <i>file</i> (the copy in your working directory) is now the result of merging the two versions; an unmodified copy of your file is also in your working directory, with the name ` <b>.#</b><i>file</i><b>.</b><i>version</i>', where <i>version</i> is the revision that your modified file started from. (Note that some systems automatically purge files that begin with  `<b>.#</b>' if they have not been accessed for a few days. If you intend to keep a copy of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename it.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>?</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
<i>file</i> is in your working directory, but does not correspond to anything in the source repository, and is not in the list of files for  <b>cvs</b> to ignore (see the description of the <b>-I</b> option).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use the <b>-A</b> option to reset any sticky tags, dates, or <b>-k</b> options.  (If you get a working copy of a file by using one of the  <b>-r</b>, <b>-D</b>, or <b>-k</b> options, <b>cvs</b> remembers the corresponding tag, date, or  <i>kflag</i> and continues using it on future updates; use the  <b>-A</b> option to make <b>cvs</b> forget these specifications, and retrieve the ``head'' version of the file).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>-j</b><i>branch</i> option merges the changes made between the resulting revision and the revision that it is based on (e.g., if the tag refers to a branch, <b>cvs</b> will merge all changes made in that branch into your working file).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With two <b>-j</b> options, <b>cvs</b> will merge in the changes between the two respective revisions. This can be used to ``remove'' a certain delta from your working file. E.g., If the file foo.c is based on revision 1.6 and I want to remove the changes made between 1.3 and 1.5, I might do:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<br/>
example% cvs update -j1.5 -j1.3 foo.c	# note the order...<br/>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In addition, each <b>-j</b> option can contain on optional date specification which, when used with branches, can limit the chosen revision to one within a specific date. An optional date is specified by adding a colon (:) to the tag.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<br/>
-jSymbolic_Tag:Date_Specifier<br/>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use the <b>-d</b> option to create any directories that exist in the repository if they're missing from the working directory.  (Normally, update acts only on directories and files that were already enrolled in your working directory.)  This is useful for updating directories that were created in the repository since the initial  <b>checkout</b>; but it has an unfortunate side effect.  If you deliberately avoided certain directories in the repository when you created your working directory (either through use of a module name or by listing explicitly the files and directories you wanted on the command line), then updating with <b>-d</b> will create those directories, which may not be what you want.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use <b>-I</b> <i>name</i> to ignore files whose names match <i>name</i> (in your working directory) during the update.  You can specify  <b>-I</b> more than once on the command line to specify several files to ignore.  By default,  <b>update</b> ignores files whose names match certain patterns; for an up to date list of ignored file names, see the Cederqvist manual (as described in the SEE ALSO section of this manpage).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use `<b>-I !</b>' to avoid ignoring any files at all.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use the `<b>-C</b>' option to overwrite locally modified files with clean copies from the repository (the modified file is saved in ` <b>.#</b><i>file</i><b>.</b><i>revision</i>', however).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The standard <b>cvs</b> command options <b>-f</b>, <b>-k</b>,  <b>-l</b>, <b>-P</b>, <b>-p</b>, and <b>-r</b> are also available with  <b>update</b>.</div>

<small>CVSROOT</small></dt>
<dd>
Should contain the full pathname to the root of the <b>cvs</b> source repository (where the <small>RCS</small> files are kept).  This information must be available to  <b>cvs</b> for most commands to execute; if <small>CVSROOT</small> is not set, or if you wish to override it for one invocation, you can supply it on the command line: `<b>cvs -d <i>cvsroot cvs_command</i>...</b>' You may not need to set <small>CVSROOT</small> if your  <b>cvs</b> binary has the right path compiled in; use `<b>cvs -v</b>' to display all compiled-in paths.</dd>
