<h1 id="x4445534352495054494f4e">DESCRIPTION</h1> The manual pages in section 2 provide an overview of the system calls, their error returns, and other common definitions and concepts.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Programs may be restricted to a subset of system calls with <a class="link-man" href="../html2/pledge.html">pledge(2)</a>.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x444941474e4f5354494353">DIAGNOSTICS</h1> Nearly all of the system calls provide an error number via the identifier <span class="define">errno</span>, which expands to an addressable location of type <span class="type">int</span>. The address of <b class="var">errno</b> in each thread is guaranteed to be unique for the lifetime of the thread. Applications must use <b class="var">errno</b> as defined in <b class="includes">&lt;<a class="link-includes">errno.h</a>&gt;</b> and not attempt to use a custom definition.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a system call detects an error, it returns an integer value indicating failure (usually -1) and sets the variable <b class="var">errno</b> accordingly. (This allows interpretation of the failure on receiving a -1 and to take action accordingly.) Successful calls never set <b class="var">errno</b>; once set, it remains until another error occurs. It should only be examined after an error. Note that a number of system calls overload the meanings of these error numbers, and that the meanings must be interpreted according to the type and circumstances of the call.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following is a complete list of the errors and their names as given in <b class="includes">&lt;<a class="link-includes">sys/errno.h</a>&gt;</b>.<dl style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;" class="list list-hang">

Process</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A process is a collection of one or more threads, plus the resources shared by those threads such as process ID, address space, user IDs and group IDs, and root directory and current working directory.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Process ID</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
Each active process in the system is uniquely identified by a non-negative integer called a process ID. The range of this ID is from 0 to 99999.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Parent Process ID</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A new process is created by a currently active process; (see <a class="link-man" href="../html2/fork.html">fork(2)</a>). The parent process ID of a process is initially the process ID of its creator. If the creating process exits, the parent process ID of each child is set to the ID of a system process, <a class="link-man" href="../html8/init.html">init(8)</a>.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Process Group</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
Each active process is a member of a process group that is identified by a non-negative integer called the process group ID. This is the process ID of the group leader. This grouping permits the signaling of related processes (see <a class="link-man" href="../html4/termios.html">termios(4)</a>) and the job control mechanisms of <a class="link-man" href="../html1/ksh.html">ksh(1)</a> and <a class="link-man" href="../html1/csh.html">csh(1)</a>.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Session</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A session is a set of one or more process groups. A session is created by a successful call to <a class="link-man" href="../html2/setsid.html">setsid(2)</a>, which causes the caller to become the only member of the only process group in the new session.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Session Leader</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A process that has created a new session by a successful call to <a class="link-man" href="../html2/setsid.html">setsid(2)</a>, is known as a session leader. Only a session leader may acquire a terminal as its controlling terminal (see <a class="link-man" href="../html4/termios.html">termios(4)</a>).</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Controlling Process</dt>

<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Controlling Terminal</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A terminal that is associated with a session is known as the controlling terminal for that session and its members.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Terminal Process Group ID</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A terminal may be acquired by a session leader as its controlling terminal. Once a terminal is associated with a session, any of the process groups within the session may be placed into the foreground by setting the terminal process group ID to the ID of the process group. This facility is used to arbitrate between multiple jobs contending for the same terminal; (see <a class="link-man" href="../html1/ksh.html">ksh(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../html1/csh.html">csh(1)</a>, and <a class="link-man" href="../html4/tty.html">tty(4)</a>).</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Orphaned Process Group</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A process group is considered to be <span class="emph">orphaned</span> if it is not under the control of a job control shell. More precisely, a process group is orphaned when none of its members has a parent process that is in the same session as the group, but is in a different process group. Note that when a process exits, the parent process for its children is changed to be <a class="link-man" href="../html8/init.html">init(8)</a>, which is in a separate session. Not all members of an orphaned process group are necessarily orphaned processes (those whose creating process has exited). The process group of a session leader is orphaned by definition.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Thread</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A thread is a preemptively scheduled flow of control within a process, with its own set of register values, floating point environment, thread ID, signal mask, pending signal set, alternate signal stack, thread control block address, resource utilization, errno variable location, and values for thread-specific keys. A process initially has just one thread, a duplicate of the thread in the parent process that created this process.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Real User ID and Real Group ID</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
Each user on the system is identified by a positive integer termed the real user ID.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each user is also a member of one or more groups. One of these groups is distinguished from others and used in implementing accounting facilities. The positive integer corresponding to this distinguished group is termed the real group ID.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All processes have a real user ID and real group ID. These are initialized from the equivalent attributes of the process that created it.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Effective User ID, Effective Group ID, and Group Access List</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
Access to system resources is governed by two values: the effective user ID, and the group access list. The first member of the group access list is also known as the effective group ID. (In POSIX.1, the group access list is known as the set of supplementary group IDs, and it is unspecified whether the effective group ID is a member of the list.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The effective user ID and effective group ID are initially the process's real user ID and real group ID respectively. Either may be modified through execution of a set-user-ID or set-group-ID file (possibly by one of its ancestors) (see <a class="link-man" href="../html2/execve.html">execve(2)</a>). By convention, the effective group ID (the first member of the group access list) is duplicated, so that the execution of a set-group-ID program does not result in the loss of the original (real) group ID.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The group access list is a set of group IDs used only in determining resource accessibility. Access checks are performed as described below in &#8220;File Access Permissions&#8221;.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Saved Set User ID and Saved Set Group ID</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
When a process executes a new file, the effective user ID is set to the owner of the file if the file is set-user-ID, and the effective group ID (first element of the group access list) is set to the group of the file if the file is set-group-ID. The effective user ID of the process is then recorded as the saved set-user-ID, and the effective group ID of the process is recorded as the saved set-group-ID. These values may be used to regain those values as the effective user or group ID after reverting to the real ID (see <a class="link-man" href="../html2/setuid.html">setuid(2)</a>). (In POSIX.1, the saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID are optional, and are used in setuid and setgid, but this does not work as desired for the superuser.)</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Superuser</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A process is recognized as a <span class="emph">superuser</span> process and is granted special privileges if its effective user ID is 0.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Special Processes</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
The processes with process IDs of 0 and 1 are special. Process 0 is the scheduler. Process 1 is the initialization process <a class="link-man" href="../html8/init.html">init(8)</a>, and is the ancestor of every other process in the system. It is used to control the process structure.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Descriptor</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
An integer assigned by the system when a file is referenced by <a class="link-man" href="../html2/open.html">open(2)</a> or <a class="link-man" href="../html2/dup.html">dup(2)</a>, or when a socket is created by <a class="link-man" href="../html2/pipe.html">pipe(2)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../html2/socket.html">socket(2)</a> or <a class="link-man" href="../html2/socketpair.html">socketpair(2)</a>, which uniquely identifies an access path to that file or socket from a given process or any of its children.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
File Name</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
Names consisting of up to 255 (<span class="define">NAME_MAX</span>) characters may be used to name an ordinary file, special file, or directory.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These characters may be arbitrary eight-bit values, excluding 0 (NUL) and the ASCII code for &#8216;<code class="lit">/</code>&#8217; (slash).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that it is generally unwise to use &#8216;<code class="lit">*</code>&#8217;, &#8216;<code class="lit">?</code>&#8217;, &#8216;<code class="lit">[</code>&#8217; or &#8216;<code class="lit">]</code>&#8217; as part of file names because of the special meaning attached to these characters by the shell.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note also that <span class="define">NAME_MAX</span> is an upper limit fixed by the kernel, meant to be used for sizing buffers. Some filesystems may have additional restrictions. These can be queried using <a class="link-man" href="../html2/pathconf.html">pathconf(2)</a> and <a class="link-man" href="../html2/fpathconf.html">fpathconf(2)</a>.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Path Name</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A path name is a NUL-terminated character string starting with an optional slash &#8216;<code class="lit">/</code>&#8217;, followed by zero or more directory names separated by slashes, optionally followed by a file name. The total length of a path name must be less than 1024 (<span class="define">PATH_MAX</span>) characters. Additional restrictions may apply, depending upon the filesystem, to be queried with <a class="link-man" href="../html2/pathconf.html">pathconf(2)</a> or <a class="link-man" href="../html2/fpathconf.html">fpathconf(2)</a> if needed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a path name begins with a slash, the path search begins at the <span class="emph">root</span> directory. Otherwise, the search begins from the current working directory. A slash by itself names the root directory. An empty pathname is invalid.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Directory</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A directory is a special type of file that contains entries that are references to other files. Directory entries are called links. By convention, a directory contains at least two links, &#8216;<code class="lit">.</code>&#8217; and &#8216;<code class="lit">..</code>&#8217;, referred to as <span class="emph">dot</span> and <span class="emph">dot-dot</span> respectively. Dot refers to the directory itself and dot-dot refers to its parent directory.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Root Directory and Current Working Directory</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
Each process has associated with it a concept of a root directory and a current working directory for the purpose of resolving path name searches. A process's root directory need not be the root directory of the root file system.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
File Access Permissions</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
Every file in the file system has a set of access permissions. These permissions are used in determining whether a process may perform a requested operation on the file (such as opening a file for writing). Access permissions are established at the time a file is created. They may be changed at some later time through the <a class="link-man" href="../html2/chmod.html">chmod(2)</a> call.<div class="spacer">
</div>
File access is broken down according to whether a file may be: read, written, or executed. Directory files use the execute permission to control if the directory may be searched.<div class="spacer">
</div>
File access permissions are interpreted by the system as they apply to three different classes of users: the owner of the file, those users in the file's group, anyone else. Every file has an independent set of access permissions for each of these classes. When an access check is made, the system decides if permission should be granted by checking the access information applicable to the caller.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Read, write, and execute/search permissions on a file are granted to a process if:<div class="spacer">
</div>
The process's effective user ID is that of the superuser. (Note: even the superuser cannot execute a non-executable file.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The process's effective user ID matches the user ID of the owner of the file and the owner permissions allow the access.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The process's effective user ID does not match the user ID of the owner of the file, and either the process's effective group ID matches the group ID of the file, or the group ID of the file is in the process's group access list, and the group permissions allow the access.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Neither the effective user ID nor effective group ID and group access list of the process match the corresponding user ID and group ID of the file, but the permissions for &#8220;other users&#8221; allow access.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Otherwise, permission is denied.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
Sockets and Address Families</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
A socket is an endpoint for communication between processes. Each socket has queues for sending and receiving data.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Sockets are typed according to their communications properties. These properties include whether messages sent and received at a socket require the name of the partner, whether communication is reliable, the format used in naming message recipients, etc.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each instance of the system supports some collection of socket types; consult <a class="link-man" href="../html2/socket.html">socket(2)</a> for more information about the types available and their properties.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each instance of the system supports some number of sets of communications protocols. Each protocol set supports addresses of a certain format. An Address Family is the set of addresses for a specific group of protocols. Each socket has an address chosen from the address family in which the socket was created.</dd>
