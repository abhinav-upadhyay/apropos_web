fclose - close a stream
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</A>&gt;
<BR>

<P>
int fclose(FILE *</B><I>stream</I><B>);
<BR>

</B>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>fclose</I>() function shall cause the stream pointed to by <I>stream</I>
to be flushed and the associated file to be
closed. Any unwritten buffered data for the stream shall be written
to the file; any unread buffered data shall be discarded.
Whether or not the call succeeds, the stream shall be disassociated
from the file and any buffer set by the <I>setbuf</I>() or <I>setvbuf</I>()
function shall be
disassociated from the stream. If the associated buffer was automatically
allocated, it shall be deallocated.
<P>

The
<I>fclose</I>() function shall mark for update the <I>st_ctime</I> and
<I>st_mtime</I> fields of the underlying file, if the stream
was writable, and if buffered data remains that has not yet been written
to the file. The <I>fclose</I>() function shall perform
the equivalent of a <I>close</I>() on the file descriptor that is associated
with the stream
pointed to by <I>stream</I>. 
<P>

After the call to <I>fclose</I>(), any use of <I>stream</I> results
in undefined behavior.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, <I>fclose</I>() shall return 0; otherwise,
it shall return EOF  and set
<I>errno</I> to indicate the error. 
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>fclose</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor underlying <I>stream</I>
and the process would be delayed in the write
operation. 
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The file descriptor underlying stream is not valid. 
<DT><B>EFBIG</B>

<DD>
An
attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the maximum file size.
<DT><B>EFBIG</B>

<DD>
An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the process' file
size limit. 
<DT><B>EFBIG</B>

<DD>
The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to write at or
beyond the offset maximum associated with the corresponding
stream. 
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The <I>fclose</I>() function was interrupted by a signal. 
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
The process is a member of a background process group attempting to
write to its controlling terminal, TOSTOP is set, the process
is neither ignoring nor blocking SIGTTOU, and the process group of
the process is orphaned. This error may also be returned under
implementation-defined conditions. 
<DT><B>ENOSPC</B>

<DD>
There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file.
<DT><B>EPIPE</B>

<DD>
An
attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not open for reading
by any process. A SIGPIPE signal shall also be sent to the
thread. 
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>fclose</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ENXIO</B>

<DD>
A
request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside
the capabilities of the device.
