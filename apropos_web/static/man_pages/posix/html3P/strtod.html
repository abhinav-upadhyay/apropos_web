<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

These functions shall convert the initial portion of the string pointed
to by <I>nptr</I> to <B>double</B>, <B>float</B>, and
<B>long double</B> representation, respectively. First, they decompose
the input string into three parts:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space characters (as
specified by <I>isspace</I>())
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
A subject sequence interpreted as a floating-point constant or representing
infinity or NaN
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
A final string of one or more unrecognized characters, including the
terminating null byte of the input string
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence to a floating-point
number, and return the result.
<P>

The expected form of the subject sequence is an optional plus or minus
sign, then one of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
A non-empty sequence of decimal digits optionally containing a radix
character, then an optional exponent part
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
A 0x or 0X, then a non-empty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally
containing a radix character, then an optional binary
exponent part
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
One of INF or INFINITY, ignoring case
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
One of NAN or NAN(<I>n-char-sequence_opt</I>), ignoring case in the
NAN part, where:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>n-char-sequence:
    digit
    nondigit
    n-char-sequence digit
    n-char-sequence nondigit
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

<P>

The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence
of the input string, starting with the first non-white-space
character, that is of the expected form. The subject sequence contains
no characters if the input string is not of the expected
form.
<P>

If the subject sequence has the expected form for a floating-point
number, the sequence of characters starting with the first
digit or the decimal-point character (whichever occurs first) shall
be interpreted as a floating constant of the C language, except
that the radix character shall be used in place of a period, and that
if neither an exponent part nor a radix character appears in
a decimal floating-point number, or if a binary exponent part does
not appear in a hexadecimal floating-point number, an exponent
part of the appropriate type with value zero is assumed to follow
the last digit in the string. If the subject sequence begins with
a minus sign, the sequence shall be interpreted as negated. A character
sequence INF or INFINITY shall be interpreted as an
infinity, if representable in the return type, else as if it were
a floating constant that is too large for the range of the return
type. A character sequence NAN or NAN(<I>n-char-sequence_opt</I>) shall
be interpreted as a quiet NaN, if
supported in the return type, else as if it were a subject sequence
part that does not have the expected form; the meaning of the
<I>n</I>-char sequences is implementation-defined. A pointer to the
final string is stored in the object pointed to by
<I>endptr</I>, provided that <I>endptr</I> is not a null pointer.
<P>

If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is
a power of 2, the value resulting from the conversion is
correctly rounded.
<P>

The
radix character is defined in the program's locale (category <I>LC_NUMERIC
).</I> In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the
radix character is not defined, the radix character shall default
to a period ( <B>'.'</B> ). 
<P>

In other than the C  or POSIX  locales, other
implementation-defined subject sequences may be accepted.
<P>

If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form,
no conversion shall be performed; the value of <I>str</I>
is stored in the object pointed to by <I>endptr</I>, provided that
<I>endptr</I> is not a null pointer.
<P>

The
<I>strtod</I>() function shall not change the setting of <I>errno</I>
if successful.
<P>

Since 0 is returned on error and is also a valid return on success,
an application wishing to check for error situations should
set <I>errno</I> to 0, then call <I>strtod</I>(), <I>strtof</I>(), or
<I>strtold</I>(), then check <I>errno</I>. 
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the converted
value. If no conversion could be performed, 0 shall be
returned, and <I>errno</I> may be set to [EINVAL].
<P>

If the correct value is outside the range of representable values,
&plusmn;HUGE_VAL, &plusmn;HUGE_VALF, or &plusmn;HUGE_VALL
shall be returned (according to the sign of the value), and <I>errno</I>
shall be set to [ERANGE].
<P>

If the correct value would cause an underflow, a value whose magnitude
is no greater than the smallest normalized positive
number in the return type shall be returned and <I>errno</I> set to
[ERANGE].
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

These functions shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ERANGE</B>

<DD>
The value to be returned would cause overflow  or underflow. 
<P>
</DL>
<P>

These functions may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
No
conversion could be performed. 
<P>
</DL>
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is
not a power of 2, and the result is not exactly representable,
the result should be one of the two numbers in the appropriate internal
format that are adjacent to the hexadecimal floating source
value, with the extra stipulation that the error should have a correct
sign for the current rounding direction.
<P>

If the subject sequence has the decimal form and at most DECIMAL_DIG
(defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/float.h">float.h</A>&gt;</I>) significant digits, the result should
be correctly rounded. If the subject
sequence <I>D</I> has the decimal form and more than DECIMAL_DIG significant
digits, consider the two bounding, adjacent decimal
strings <I>L</I> and <I>U</I>, both having DECIMAL_DIG significant digits,
such that the values of <I>L</I>, <I>D</I>, and <I>U</I>
satisfy <I>L</I> &lt;= <I>D</I> &lt;= <I>U</I>. The result should be one of
the (equal or adjacent) values that would be obtained
by correctly rounding <I>L</I> and <I>U</I> according to the current
rounding direction, with the extra stipulation that the error
with respect to <I>D</I> should have a correct sign for the current
rounding direction.
<P>

The changes to <I>strtod</I>() introduced by the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999
standard can alter the behavior of well-formed
applications complying with the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1990 standard and thus
earlier versions of the base documents. One such example
would be:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>int
what_kind_of_number (char *s)
{
    char *endp;
    double d;
    long l;


    d = strtod(s, &amp;endp);
    if (s != endp &amp;&amp; *endp == `\0')
        printf(&quot;It's a float with value %g\n&quot;, d);
    else
    {
        l = strtol(s, &amp;endp, 0);
        if (s != endp &amp;&amp; *endp == `\0')
            printf(&quot;It's an integer with value %ld\n&quot;, 1);
        else
            return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

If the function is called with:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>what_kind_of_number (&quot;0x10&quot;)
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

an ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1990 standard-compliant library will result in the
function printing:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>It's an integer with value 16
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

With the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard, the result is:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>It's a float with value 16
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The change in behavior is due to the inclusion of floating-point numbers
in hexadecimal notation without requiring that either a
decimal point or the binary exponent be present.
