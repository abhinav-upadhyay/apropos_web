<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() functions shall obtain status information pertaining to one of the caller's child processes. Various options permit status information to be obtained for child processes that have terminated or stopped. If status information is available for two or more child processes, the order in which their status is reported is unspecified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>wait</i>() function shall suspend execution of the calling thread until status information for one of the terminated child processes of the calling process is available, or until delivery of a signal whose action is either to execute a signal-catching function or to terminate the process. If more than one thread is suspended in  <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() awaiting termination of the same process, exactly one thread shall return the process status at the time of the target process termination. If status information is available prior to the call to  <i>wait</i>(), return shall be immediate.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>wait</i>() if the  <i>pid</i> argument is (<b>pid_t</b>)-1 and the  <i>options</i> argument is 0. Otherwise, its behavior shall be modified by the values of the  <i>pid</i> and <i>options</i> arguments.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>pid</i> argument specifies a set of child processes for which  <i>status</i> is requested. The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall only return the status of a child process from this set:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
If <i>pid</i> is equal to (<b>pid_t</b>)-1, <i>status</i> is requested for any child process. In this respect,  <i>waitpid</i>() is then equivalent to  <i>wait</i>().</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
If <i>pid</i> is greater than 0, it specifies the process ID of a single child process for which  <i>status</i> is requested.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
If <i>pid</i> is 0, <i>status</i> is requested for any child process whose process group ID is equal to that of the calling process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
If <i>pid</i> is less than (<b>pid_t</b>)-1, <i>status</i> is requested for any child process whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of  <i>pid</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>options</i> argument is constructed from the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the following flags, defined in the  <i>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</i> header:<dl>
<dt>
WCONTINUED</dt>
<dd>
The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall report the status of any continued child process specified by  <i>pid</i> whose status has not been reported since it continued from a job control stop.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
WNOHANG</dt>
<dd>
The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall not suspend execution of the calling thread if  <i>status</i> is not immediately available for one of the child processes specified by  <i>pid</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
WUNTRACED</dt>
<dd>
The status of any child processes specified by <i>pid</i> that are stopped, and whose status has not yet been reported since they stopped, shall also be reported to the requesting process.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the calling process has SA_NOCLDWAIT set or has SIGCHLD set to SIG_IGN, and the process has no unwaited-for children that were transformed into zombie processes, the calling thread shall block until all of the children of the process containing the calling thread terminate, and  <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() shall fail and set  <i>errno</i> to [ECHILD].<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() return because the status of a child process is available, these functions shall return a value equal to the process ID of the child process. In this case, if the value of the argument  <i>stat_loc</i> is not a null pointer, information shall be stored in the location pointed to by  <i>stat_loc</i>. The value stored at the location pointed to by  <i>stat_loc</i> shall be 0 if and only if the status returned is from a terminated child process that terminated by one of the following means:<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
The process returned 0 from <i>main</i>().</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
The process called <i>_exit</i>() or <i>exit</i>() with a  <i>status</i> argument of 0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 3.</dt>
<dd>
The process was terminated because the last thread in the process terminated.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Regardless of its value, this information may be interpreted using the following macros, which are defined in  <i>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</i> and evaluate to integral expressions; the  <i>stat_val</i> argument is the integer value pointed to by  <i>stat_loc</i>.<dl>

It is unspecified whether the <i>status</i> value returned by calls to  <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() for processes created by  <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() can indicate a WIFSTOPPED(<i>stat_val</i>) before subsequent calls to  <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() indicate WIFEXITED(<i>stat_val</i>) as the result of an error detected before the new process image starts executing.<div class="spacer">

<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> A call to the  <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() function only returns  <i>status</i> on an immediate child process of the calling process; that is, a child that was produced by a single  <i>fork</i>() call (perhaps followed by an  <i>exec</i> or other function calls) from the parent. If a child produces grandchildren by further use of  <i>fork</i>(), none of those grandchildren nor any of their descendants affect the behavior of a  <i>wait</i>() from the original parent process. Nothing in this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 prevents an implementation from providing extensions that permit a process to get  <i>status</i> from a grandchild or any other process, but a process that does not use such extensions must be guaranteed to see  <i>status</i> from only its direct children.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>waitpid</i>() function is provided for three reasons:<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
To support job control</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
To permit a non-blocking version of the <i>wait</i>() function</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 3.</dt>
<dd>
To permit a library routine, such as <i>system</i>() or <i>pclose</i>(), to wait for its children without interfering with other terminated children for which the process has not waited</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first two of these facilities are based on the <i>wait3</i>() function provided by 4.3 BSD. The function uses the  <i>options</i> argument, which is equivalent to an argument to <i>wait3</i>(). The WUNTRACED flag is used only in conjunction with job control on systems supporting job control. Its name comes from 4.3 BSD and refers to the fact that there are two types of stopped processes in that implementation: processes being traced via the  <i>ptrace</i>() debugging facility and (untraced) processes stopped by job control signals. Since  <i>ptrace</i>() is not part of this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, only the second type is relevant. The name WUNTRACED was retained because its usage is the same, even though the name is not intuitively meaningful in this context.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The third reason for the <i>waitpid</i>() function is to permit independent sections of a process to spawn and wait for children without interfering with each other. For example, the following problem occurs in developing a portable shell, or command interpreter:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>stream = popen(&quot;/bin/true&quot;);</b><br/>
<b>(void) system(&quot;sleep 100&quot;);</b><br/>
<b>(void) pclose(stream);</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
On all historical implementations, the final <i>pclose</i>() fails to reap the  <i>wait</i>() <i>status</i> of the <i>popen</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The status values are retrieved by macros, rather than given as specific bit encodings as they are in most historical implementations (and thus expected by existing programs). This was necessary to eliminate a limitation on the number of signals an implementation can support that was inherent in the traditional encodings. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 does require that a  <i>status</i> value of zero corresponds to a process calling  <i>_exit</i>(0), as this is the most common encoding expected by existing programs. Some of the macro names were adopted from 4.3 BSD.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These macros syntactically operate on an arbitrary integer value. The behavior is undefined unless that value is one stored by a successful call to  <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() in the location pointed to by the  <i>stat_loc</i> argument. An early proposal attempted to make this clearer by specifying each argument as * <i>stat_loc</i> rather than  <i>stat_val</i>. However, that did not follow the conventions of other specifications in this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 or traditional usage. It also could have implied that the argument to the macro must literally be * <i>stat_loc</i>; in fact, that value can be stored or passed as an argument to other functions before being interpreted by these macros.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The extension that affects <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() and is common in historical implementations is the  <i>ptrace</i>() function. It is called by a child process and causes that child to stop and return a  <i>status</i> that appears identical to the  <i>status</i> indicated by WIFSTOPPED. The <i>status</i> of <i>ptrace</i>() children is traditionally returned regardless of the WUNTRACED flag (or by the  <i>wait</i>() function). Most applications do not need to concern themselves with such extensions because they have control over what extensions they or their children use. However, applications, such as command interpreters, that invoke arbitrary processes may see this behavior when those arbitrary processes misuse such extensions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Implementations that support <b>core</b> file creation or other implementation-defined actions on termination of some processes traditionally provide a bit in the  <i>status</i> returned by <i>wait</i>() to indicate that such actions have occurred.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Allowing the <i>wait</i>() family of functions to discard a pending SIGCHLD signal that is associated with a successfully waited-for child process puts them into the  <i>sigwait</i>() and <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() category with respect to SIGCHLD.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This definition allows implementations to treat a pending SIGCHLD signal as accepted by the process in  <i>wait</i>(), with the same meaning of &quot;accepted&quot; as when that word is applied to the  <i>sigwait</i>() family of functions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Allowing the <i>wait</i>() family of functions to behave this way permits an implementation to be able to deal precisely with SIGCHLD signals.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In particular, an implementation that does accept (discard) the SIGCHLD signal can make the following guarantees regardless of the queuing depth of signals in general (the list of waitable children can hold the SIGCHLD queue):<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
If a SIGCHLD signal handler is established via <i>sigaction</i>() without the SA_RESETHAND flag, SIGCHLD signals can be accurately counted; that is, exactly one SIGCHLD signal will be delivered to or accepted by the process for every child process that terminates.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
A single <i>wait</i>() issued from a SIGCHLD signal handler can be guaranteed to return immediately with status information for a child process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 3.</dt>
<dd>
When SA_SIGINFO is requested, the SIGCHLD signal handler can be guaranteed to receive a non-NULL pointer to a  <b>siginfo_t</b> structure that describes a child process for which a wait via  <i>waitpid</i>() or  <i>waitid</i>() will not block or fail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 4.</dt>
<dd>
The <i>system</i>() function will not cause a process' SIGCHLD handler to be called as a result of the  <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i> executed within  <i>system</i>() because <i>system</i>() will accept the SIGCHLD signal when it performs a  <i>waitpid</i>() for its child process. This is a desirable behavior of  <i>system</i>() so that it can be used in a library without causing side effects to the application linked with the library.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
An implementation that does not permit the <i>wait</i>() family of functions to accept (discard) a pending SIGCHLD signal associated with a successfully waited-for child, cannot make the guarantees described above for the following reasons:<dl>
<dt>
Guarantee #1</dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Although it might be assumed that reliable queuing of all SIGCHLD signals generated by the system can make this guarantee, the counter-example is the case of a process that blocks SIGCHLD and performs an indefinite loop of  <i>fork</i>()/ <i>wait</i>() operations. If the implementation supports queued signals, then eventually the system will run out of memory for the queue. The guarantee cannot be made because there must be some limit to the depth of queuing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Guarantees #2 and #3</dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
These cannot be guaranteed unless the <i>wait</i>() family of functions accepts the SIGCHLD signal. Otherwise, a  <i>fork</i>()/ <i>wait</i>() executed while SIGCHLD is blocked (as in the  <i>system</i>() function) will result in an invocation of the handler when SIGCHLD is unblocked, after the process has disappeared.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Guarantee #4</dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Although possible to make this guarantee, <i>system</i>() would have to set the SIGCHLD handler to SIG_DFL so that the SIGCHLD signal generated by its  <i>fork</i>() would be discarded (the SIGCHLD default action is to be ignored), then restore it to its previous setting. This would have the undesirable side effect of discarding all SIGCHLD signals pending to the process.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
