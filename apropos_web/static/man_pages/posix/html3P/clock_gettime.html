<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>clock_getres</I>() function shall return the resolution of any
clock. Clock resolutions are implementation-defined and
cannot be set by a process. If the argument <I>res</I> is not NULL,
the resolution of the specified clock shall be stored in the
location pointed to by <I>res</I>. If <I>res</I> is NULL, the clock
resolution is not returned. If the <I>time</I> argument of
<I>clock_settime</I>() is not a multiple of <I>res</I>, then the value
is truncated to a multiple of <I>res</I>.
<P>

The <I>clock_gettime</I>() function shall return the current value
<I>tp</I> for the specified clock, <I>clock_id</I>.
<P>

The <I>clock_settime</I>() function shall set the specified clock,
<I>clock_id</I>, to the value specified by <I>tp</I>. Time
values that are between two consecutive non-negative integer multiples
of the resolution of the specified clock shall be truncated
down to the smaller multiple of the resolution.
<P>

A clock may be system-wide (that is, visible to all processes) or
per-process (measuring time that is meaningful only within a
process). All implementations shall support a <I>clock_id</I> of CLOCK_REALTIME
as defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/time.h">time.h</A>&gt;</I>. This clock represents the realtime clock
for the system. For this clock, the
values returned by <I>clock_gettime</I>() and specified by <I>clock_settime</I>()
represent the amount of time (in seconds and
nanoseconds) since the Epoch. An implementation may also support additional
clocks. The interpretation of time values for these
clocks is unspecified.
<P>

If the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock is set via <I>clock_settime</I>(),
the new value of the clock shall be used to
determine the time of expiration for absolute time services based
upon the CLOCK_REALTIME clock. This applies to the time at which
armed absolute timers expire. If the absolute time requested at the
invocation of such a time service is before the new value of
the clock, the time service shall expire immediately as if the clock
had reached the requested time normally.
<P>

Setting the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock via <I>clock_settime</I>()
shall have no effect on threads that are blocked
waiting for a relative time service based upon this clock, including
the <I>nanosleep</I>() function; nor on the expiration of relative
timers based upon this clock.
Consequently, these time services shall expire when the requested
relative interval elapses, independently of the new or old value
of the clock.
<P>

If the Monotonic Clock option is supported, all implementations shall
support a <I>clock_id</I> of CLOCK_MONOTONIC defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/time.h">time.h</A>&gt;</I>.
This clock represents the monotonic clock for the system. For this
clock,
the value returned by <I>clock_gettime</I>() represents the amount
of time (in seconds and nanoseconds) since an unspecified point
in the past (for example, system start-up time, or the Epoch). This
point does not change after system start-up time. The value of
the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock cannot be set via <I>clock_settime</I>().
This function shall fail if it is invoked with a
<I>clock_id</I> argument of CLOCK_MONOTONIC. 
<P>

The effect of setting a clock via <I>clock_settime</I>() on armed per-process
timers associated with a clock other than
CLOCK_REALTIME is implementation-defined.
<P>

If
the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock is set via <I>clock_settime</I>(),
the new value of the clock shall be used to determine the
time at which the system shall awaken a thread blocked on an absolute
<I>clock_nanosleep</I>() call based upon the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.
If the absolute time
requested at the invocation of such a time service is before the new
value of the clock, the call shall return immediately as if
the clock had reached the requested time normally.
<P>

Setting the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock via <I>clock_settime</I>()
shall have no effect on any thread that is blocked on a
relative <I>clock_nanosleep</I>() call. Consequently, the call shall
return when
the requested relative interval elapses, independently of the new
or old value of the clock. 
<P>

The appropriate privilege to set a particular clock is implementation-defined.
<P>

If _POSIX_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall support clock
ID values obtained by invoking <I>clock_getcpuclockid</I>(), which
represent the CPU-time clock of a given process.
Implementations shall also support the special <B>clockid_t</B> value
CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, which represents the CPU-time clock
of the calling process when invoking one of the <I>clock_*</I>() or
<I>timer_*</I>() functions. For these clock IDs, the values returned
by <I>clock_gettime</I>() and
specified by <I>clock_settime</I>() represent the amount of execution
time of the process associated with the clock. Changing the
value of a CPU-time clock via <I>clock_settime</I>() shall have no
effect on the behavior of the sporadic server scheduling policy
(see <I>Scheduling Policies</I> ). 
<P>

If _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall support
clock ID values obtained by invoking <I>pthread_getcpuclockid</I>(),
which represent the CPU-time clock of a given thread.
Implementations shall also support the special <B>clockid_t</B> value
CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID, which represents the CPU-time clock
of the calling thread when invoking one of the <I>clock_*</I>() or
<I>timer_*</I>() functions. For these clock IDs, the values returned
by <I>clock_gettime</I>() and
specified by <I>clock_settime</I>() shall represent the amount of execution
time of the thread associated with the clock. Changing
the value of a CPU-time clock via <I>clock_settime</I>() shall have
no effect on the behavior of the sporadic server scheduling
policy (see <I>Scheduling Policies</I> ). 
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

A return value of 0 shall indicate that the call succeeded. A return
value of -1 shall indicate that an error occurred, and
<I>errno</I> shall be set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>clock_getres</I>(), <I>clock_gettime</I>(), and <I>clock_settime</I>()
functions shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The <I>clock_id</I> argument does not specify a known clock.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>clock_settime</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The <I>tp</I> argument to <I>clock_settime</I>() is outside the range
for the given clock ID.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The <I>tp</I> argument specified a nanosecond value less than zero
or greater than or equal to 1000 million.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value of the <I>clock_id</I> argument is CLOCK_MONOTONIC. 
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>clock_settime</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The requesting process does not have the appropriate privilege to
set the specified clock.
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

These functions are part of the Timers option and need not be available
on all implementations.
<P>

Note that the absolute value of the monotonic clock is meaningless
(because its origin is arbitrary), and thus there is no need
to set it. Furthermore, realtime applications can rely on the fact
that the value of this clock is never set and, therefore, that
time intervals measured with this clock will not be affected by calls
to <I>clock_settime</I>().

<H2>RATIONALE</H2>
