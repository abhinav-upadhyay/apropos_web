<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

These functions shall convert the initial portion of the string pointed
to by <I>str</I> to a type <B>long</B> and <B>long
long</B> representation, respectively. First, they decompose the input
string into three parts:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space characters (as
specified by <I>isspace</I>())
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
A subject sequence interpreted as an integer represented in some radix
determined by the value of <I>base</I>
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
A final string of one or more unrecognized characters, including the
terminating null byte of the input string.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence to an integer,
and return the result.
<P>

If the value of <I>base</I> is 0, the expected form of the subject
sequence is that of a decimal constant, octal constant, or
hexadecimal constant, any of which may be preceded by a <B>'+'</B>
or <B>'-'</B> sign. A decimal constant begins with a
non-zero digit, and consists of a sequence of decimal digits. An octal
constant consists of the prefix <B>'0'</B> optionally
followed by a sequence of the digits <B>'0'</B> to <B>'7'</B> only.
A hexadecimal constant consists of the prefix 0x or 0X
followed by a sequence of the decimal digits and letters <B>'a'</B>
(or <B>'A'</B> ) to <B>'f'</B> (or <B>'F'</B> ) with
values 10 to 15 respectively.
<P>

If the value of <I>base</I> is between 2 and 36, the expected form
of the subject sequence is a sequence of letters and digits
representing an integer with the radix specified by <I>base</I>, optionally
preceded by a <B>'+'</B> or <B>'-'</B> sign. The
letters from <B>'a'</B> (or <B>'A'</B> ) to <B>'z'</B> (or <B>'Z'</B>
) inclusive are ascribed the values 10 to 35; only
letters whose ascribed values are less than that of <I>base</I> are
permitted. If the value of <I>base</I> is 16, the characters 0x
or 0X may optionally precede the sequence of letters and digits, following
the sign if present.
<P>

The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence
of the input string, starting with the first non-white-space
character that is of the expected form. The subject sequence shall
contain no characters if the input string is empty or consists
entirely of white-space characters, or if the first non-white-space
character is other than a sign or a permissible letter or
digit.
<P>

If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of <I>base</I>
is 0, the sequence of characters starting with the
first digit shall be interpreted as an integer constant. If the subject
sequence has the expected form and the value of <I>base</I>
is between 2 and 36, it shall be used as the base for conversion,
ascribing to each letter its value as given above. If the subject
sequence begins with a minus sign, the value resulting from the conversion
shall be negated. A pointer to the final string shall be
stored in the object pointed to by <I>endptr</I>, provided that <I>endptr</I>
is not a null pointer.
<P>

In other than the C  or POSIX  locales, other
implementation-defined subject sequences may be accepted.
<P>

If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form,
no conversion is performed; the value of <I>str</I> is
stored in the object pointed to by <I>endptr</I>, provided that <I>endptr</I>
is not a null pointer.
<P>

The
<I>strtol</I>() function shall not change the setting of <I>errno</I>
if successful.
<P>

Since 0, {LONG_MIN} or {LLONG_MIN}, and {LONG_MAX} or {LLONG_MAX}
are returned on error and are also valid returns on success,
an application wishing to check for error situations should set <I>errno</I>
to 0, then call <I>strtol</I>() or <I>strtoll</I>(),
then check <I>errno</I>. 
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the converted
value, if any. If no conversion could be performed, 0
shall be returned  and <I>errno</I> may be set to [EINVAL]. 
<P>

If the correct value is outside the range of representable values,
{LONG_MIN}, {LONG_MAX}, {LLONG_MIN}, or {LLONG_MAX} shall be
returned (according to the sign of the value), and <I>errno</I> set
to [ERANGE].
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

These functions shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ERANGE</B>

<DD>
The value to be returned is not representable.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

These functions may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value of <I>base</I> is not supported.
