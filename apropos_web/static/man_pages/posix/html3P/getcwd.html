This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

getcwd - get the pathname of the current working directory
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;
<BR>

<P>
char *getcwd(char *</B><I>buf</I><B>, size_t</B> <I>size</I><B>);
<BR>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>getcwd</I>() function shall place an absolute pathname of the
current working directory in the array pointed to by
<I>buf</I>, and return <I>buf</I>. The pathname copied to the array
shall contain no components that are symbolic links. The
<I>size</I> argument is the size in bytes of the character array pointed
to by the <I>buf</I> argument. If <I>buf</I> is a null
pointer, the behavior of <I>getcwd</I>() is unspecified.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, <I>getcwd</I>() shall return the <I>buf</I>
argument. Otherwise, <I>getcwd</I>() shall return a null
pointer and set <I>errno</I> to indicate the error. The contents of
the array pointed to by <I>buf</I> are then undefined.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>getcwd</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The <I>size</I> argument is 0.
<DT><B>ERANGE</B>

<DD>
The <I>size</I> argument is greater than 0, but is smaller than the
length of the pathname +1.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>getcwd</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Read or search permission was denied for a component of the pathname.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient storage space is available.

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Determining the Absolute Pathname of the Current Working Directory</H3>

<P>

The following example returns a pointer to an array that holds the
absolute pathname of the current working directory. The
pointer is returned in the <I>ptr</I> variable, which points to the
<I>buf</I> array where the pathname is stored.

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</A>&gt;
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;

long size;
char *buf;
char *ptr;

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

Since the maximum pathname length is arbitrary unless {PATH_MAX} is
defined, an application generally cannot supply a <I>buf</I>
with <I>size</I> {{PATH_MAX}+1}.
<P>

Having <I>getcwd</I>() take no arguments and instead use the <I>malloc</I>()
function to
produce space for the returned argument was considered. The advantage
is that <I>getcwd</I>() knows how big the working directory
pathname is and can allocate an appropriate amount of space. But the
programmer would have to use the <I>free</I>() function to free the
resulting object, or each use of <I>getcwd</I>() would further
reduce the available memory. Also, <I>malloc</I>() and <I>free</I>()
are used nowhere else in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Finally,
<I>getcwd</I>() is taken from the SVID where it has the two arguments
used in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
<P>

The older function <I>getwd</I>() was rejected for use in this context
because it had only
a buffer argument and no <I>size</I> argument, and thus had no way
to prevent overwriting the buffer, except to depend on the
programmer to provide a large enough buffer.
<P>

On some implementations, if <I>buf</I> is a null pointer, <I>getcwd</I>()
may obtain <I>size</I> bytes of memory using <I>malloc</I>(). In this
case, the pointer returned by <I>getcwd</I>() may be used as the argument
in a subsequent call to <I>free</I>(). Invoking <I>getcwd</I>() with
<I>buf</I> as a null
pointer is not recommended in conforming applications.
<P>

If a program is operating in a directory where some (grand)parent
directory does not permit reading, <I>getcwd</I>() may fail,
as in most implementations it must read the directory to determine
the name of the file. This can occur if search, but not read,
permission is granted in an intermediate directory, or if the program
is placed in that directory by some more privileged process
(for example, login). Including the [EACCES] error condition makes
the reporting of the error consistent and warns the application
writer that <I>getcwd</I>() can fail for reasons beyond the control
of the application writer or user. Some implementations can
avoid this occurrence (for example, by implementing <I>getcwd</I>()
using <I>pwd</I>, where <I>pwd</I> is a set-user-root process), thus
the error was made optional. Since this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits the addition of other errors, this
would be a common addition and yet one that applications
could not be expected to deal with without this addition.
