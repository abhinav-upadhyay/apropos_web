<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>sendmsg</I>() function shall send a message through a connection-mode
or connectionless-mode socket. If the socket is
connectionless-mode, the message shall be sent to the address specified
by <B>msghdr</B>. If the socket is connection-mode, the
destination address in <B>msghdr</B> shall be ignored.
<P>

The <I>sendmsg</I>() function takes the following arguments:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>socket</I><DD>
Specifies the socket file descriptor.
<DT><I>message</I><DD>
Points to a <B>msghdr</B> structure, containing both the destination
address and the buffers for the outgoing message. The
length and format of the address depend on the address family of the
socket. The <I>msg_flags</I> member is ignored.
<DT><I>flags</I><DD>
Specifies the type of message transmission. The application may specify
0 or the following flag: 
<DT>MSG_EOR<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Terminates a record (if supported by the protocol).
</DL>

<DT>MSG_OOB<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Sends out-of-band data on sockets that support out-of-bound data.
The significance and semantics of out-of-band data are
protocol-specific.
</DL>

<P>
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>msg_iov</I> and <I>msg_iovlen</I> fields of <I>message</I> specify
zero or more buffers containing the data to be sent.
<I>msg_iov</I> points to an array of <B>iovec</B> structures; <I>msg_iovlen</I>
shall be set to the dimension of this array. In
each <B>iovec</B> structure, the <I>iov_base</I> field specifies a storage
area and the <I>iov_len</I> field gives its size in
bytes. Some of these sizes can be zero. The data from each storage
area indicated by <I>msg_iov</I> is sent in turn.
<P>

Successful completion of a call to <I>sendmsg</I>() does not guarantee
delivery of the message. A return value of -1 indicates
only locally-detected errors.
<P>

If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the message
to be transmitted and the socket file descriptor does not
have O_NONBLOCK set, the <I>sendmsg</I>() function shall block until
space is available. If space is not available at the sending
socket to hold the message to be transmitted and the socket file descriptor
does have O_NONBLOCK set, the <I>sendmsg</I>() function
shall fail.
<P>

If the socket protocol supports broadcast and the specified address
is a broadcast address for the socket protocol,
<I>sendmsg</I>() shall fail if the SO_BROADCAST option is not set for
the socket.
<P>

The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges
to use the <I>sendmsg</I>() function.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, <I>sendmsg</I>() shall return the number
of bytes sent. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and
<I>errno</I> set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>sendmsg</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN </B>or EWOULDBLOCK

<DD>
The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and the requested
operation would block.
<DT><B>EAFNOSUPPORT</B>

<DD>
Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used with this
socket.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The <I>socket</I> argument is not a valid file descriptor.
<DT><B>ECONNRESET</B>

<DD>
A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
A signal interrupted <I>sendmsg</I>() before any data was transmitted.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The sum of the <I>iov_len</I> values overflows an <B>ssize_t</B>.
<DT><B>EMSGSIZE</B>

<DD>
The message is too large to be sent all at once (as the socket requires),
or the <I>msg_iovlen</I> member of the <B>msghdr</B>
structure pointed to by <I>message</I> is less than or equal to 0 or
is greater than {IOV_MAX}.
<DT><B>ENOTCONN</B>

<DD>
The socket is connection-mode but is not connected.
<DT><B>ENOTSOCK</B>

<DD>
The <I>socket</I> argument does not refer to a socket.
<DT><B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
The <I>socket</I> argument is associated with a socket that does not
support one or more of the values set in
<I>flags</I>.
<DT><B>EPIPE</B>

<DD>
The socket is shut down for writing, or the socket is connection-mode
and is no longer connected. In the latter case, and if
the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM, the SIGPIPE signal is generated
to the calling thread.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then <I>sendmsg</I>()
shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the
pathname in the socket address.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
A component of a pathname exceeded {NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire
pathname exceeded {PATH_MAX} characters.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A component of the pathname does not name an existing file or the
path name is an empty string.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix of the pathname in the socket address
is not a directory.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>sendmsg</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix; or
write access to the named socket is denied.
<DT><B>EDESTADDRREQ</B>

<DD>
The socket is not connection-mode and does not have its peer address
set, and no destination address was specified.
<DT><B>EHOSTUNREACH</B>

<DD>
The destination host cannot be reached (probably because the host
is down or a remote router cannot reach it).
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
<DT><B>EISCONN</B>

<DD>
A destination address was specified and the socket is already connected.
<DT><B>ENETDOWN</B>

<DD>
The local network interface used to reach the destination is down.
<DT><B>ENETUNREACH</B>

<DD>
No route to the network is present.
<DT><B>ENOBUFS</B>

<DD>
Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the
operation.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then <I>sendmsg</I>()
may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution
of the pathname in the socket address.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
Pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result
whose length exceeds {PATH_MAX}.
