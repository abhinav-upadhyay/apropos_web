pthread_rwlock_unlock - unlock a read-write lock object
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</A>&gt;

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>pthread_rwlock_unlock</I>() function shall release a lock held
on the read-write lock object referenced by <I>rwlock</I>.
Results are undefined if the read-write lock <I>rwlock</I> is not held
by the calling thread.
<P>

If this function is called to release a read lock from the read-write
lock object and there are other read locks currently held
on this read-write lock object, the read-write lock object remains
in the read locked state. If this function releases the last
read lock for this read-write lock object, the read-write lock object
shall be put in the unlocked state with no owners.
<P>

If this function is called to release a write lock for this read-write
lock object, the read-write lock object shall be put in
the unlocked state.
<P>

If there are threads blocked on the lock when it becomes available,
the scheduling policy shall determine which thread(s) shall
acquire the lock.  If the Thread Execution Scheduling option is
supported, when threads executing with the
scheduling policies SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, or SCHED_SPORADIC are waiting
on the lock, they shall acquire the lock in priority order
when the lock becomes available. For equal priority threads, write
locks shall take precedence over read locks.  If the Thread Execution
Scheduling option is not supported, it is
implementation-defined whether write locks take precedence over read
locks.
<P>

Results are undefined if any of these functions are called with an
uninitialized read-write lock.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

If successful, the <I>pthread_rwlock_unlock</I>() function shall return
zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>pthread_rwlock_unlock</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value specified by <I>rwlock</I> does not refer to an initialized
read-write lock object.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The current thread does not hold a lock on the read-write lock.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>pthread_rwlock_unlock</I>() function shall not return an error
code of [EINTR].
