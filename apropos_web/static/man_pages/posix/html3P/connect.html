<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>connect</I>() function shall attempt to make a connection on
a socket. The function takes the following arguments:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>socket</I><DD>
Specifies the file descriptor associated with the socket.
<DT><I>address</I><DD>
Points to a <B>sockaddr</B> structure containing the peer address.
The length and format of the address depend on the address
family of the socket.
<DT><I>address_len</I><DD>
Specifies the length of the <B>sockaddr</B> structure pointed to by
the <I>address</I> argument.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

If the socket has not already been bound to a local address, <I>connect</I>()
shall bind it to an address which, unless the
socket's address family is AF_UNIX, is an unused local address.
<P>

If the initiating socket is not connection-mode, then <I>connect</I>()
shall set the socket's peer address, and no connection is
made. For SOCK_DGRAM sockets, the peer address identifies where all
datagrams are sent on subsequent <I>send</I>() functions, and limits
the remote sender for subsequent <I>recv</I>() functions. If <I>address</I>
is a null address for the protocol, the socket's peer
address shall be reset.
<P>

If the initiating socket is connection-mode, then <I>connect</I>()
shall attempt to establish a connection to the address
specified by the <I>address</I> argument. If the connection cannot
be established immediately and O_NONBLOCK is not set for the
file descriptor for the socket, <I>connect</I>() shall block for up
to an unspecified timeout interval until the connection is
established. If the timeout interval expires before the connection
is established, <I>connect</I>() shall fail and the connection
attempt shall be aborted. If <I>connect</I>() is interrupted by a signal
that is caught while blocked waiting to establish a
connection, <I>connect</I>() shall fail and set <I>errno</I> to [EINTR],
but the connection request shall not be aborted, and the
connection shall be established asynchronously.
<P>

If the connection cannot be established immediately and O_NONBLOCK
is set for the file descriptor for the socket,
<I>connect</I>() shall fail and set <I>errno</I> to [EINPROGRESS], but
the connection request shall not be aborted, and the
connection shall be established asynchronously. Subsequent calls to
<I>connect</I>() for the same socket, before the connection is
established, shall fail and set <I>errno</I> to [EALREADY].
<P>

When the connection has been established asynchronously, <I>select</I>()
and <I>poll</I>() shall indicate that the file descriptor for the socket
is ready for writing.
<P>

The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges
to use the <I>connect</I>() function.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, <I>connect</I>() shall return 0; otherwise,
-1 shall be returned and <I>errno</I> set to indicate
the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>connect</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EADDRNOTAVAIL</B>

<DD>
The specified address is not available from the local machine.
<DT><B>EAFNOSUPPORT</B>

<DD>
The specified address is not a valid address for the address family
of the specified socket.
<DT><B>EALREADY</B>

<DD>
A connection request is already in progress for the specified socket.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The <I>socket</I> argument is not a valid file descriptor.
<DT><B>ECONNREFUSED</B>

<DD>
The target address was not listening for connections or refused the
connection request.
<DT><B>EINPROGRESS</B>

<DD>
O_NONBLOCK is set for the file descriptor for the socket and the connection
cannot be immediately established; the connection
shall be established asynchronously.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The attempt to establish a connection was interrupted by delivery
of a signal that was caught; the connection shall be
established asynchronously.
<DT><B>EISCONN</B>

<DD>
The specified socket is connection-mode and is already connected.
<DT><B>ENETUNREACH</B>

<DD>
No route to the network is present.
<DT><B>ENOTSOCK</B>

<DD>
The <I>socket</I> argument does not refer to a socket.
<DT><B>EPROTOTYPE</B>

<DD>
The specified address has a different type than the socket bound to
the specified peer address.
<DT><B>ETIMEDOUT</B>

<DD>
The attempt to connect timed out before a connection was made.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then <I>connect</I>()
shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the
pathname in <I>address</I>.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
A component of a pathname exceeded {NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire
pathname exceeded {PATH_MAX} characters.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A component of the pathname does not name an existing file or the
pathname is an empty string.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix of the pathname in <I>address</I> is
not a directory.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>connect</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix; or
write access to the named socket is denied.
<DT><B>EADDRINUSE</B>

<DD>
Attempt to establish a connection that uses addresses that are already
in use.
<DT><B>ECONNRESET</B>

<DD>
Remote host reset the connection request.
<DT><B>EHOSTUNREACH</B>

<DD>
The destination host cannot be reached (probably because the host
is down or a remote router cannot reach it).
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The <I>address_len</I> argument is not a valid length for the address
family; or invalid address family in the <B>sockaddr</B>
structure.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution
of the pathname in <I>address</I>.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
Pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result
whose length exceeds {PATH_MAX}.
<DT><B>ENETDOWN</B>

<DD>
The local network interface used to reach the destination is down.
<DT><B>ENOBUFS</B>

<DD>
No buffer space is available.
<DT><B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
The socket is listening and cannot be connected.
