<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>sigtimedwait</I>() function shall be equivalent to <I>sigwaitinfo</I>()
except that if none of the signals specified by
<I>set</I> are pending, <I>sigtimedwait</I>() shall wait for the time
interval specified in the <B>timespec</B> structure
referenced by <I>timeout</I>. If the <B>timespec</B> structure pointed
to by <I>timeout</I> is zero-valued and if none of the
signals specified by <I>set</I> are pending, then <I>sigtimedwait</I>()
shall return immediately with an error. If <I>timeout</I>
is the NULL pointer, the behavior is unspecified.  If the Monotonic
Clock option is supported, the CLOCK_MONOTONIC
clock shall be used to measure the time interval specified by the
<I>timeout</I> argument. 
<P>

The <I>sigwaitinfo</I>() function selects the pending signal from the
set specified by <I>set</I>. Should any of multiple
pending signals in the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX be selected, it
shall be the lowest numbered one. The selection order between
realtime and non-realtime signals, or between multiple pending non-realtime
signals, is unspecified. If no signal in <I>set</I> is
pending at the time of the call, the calling thread shall be suspended
until one or more signals in <I>set</I> become pending or
until it is interrupted by an unblocked, caught signal.
<P>

The <I>sigwaitinfo</I>() function shall be equivalent to the <I>sigwait</I>()
function
if the <I>info</I> argument is NULL. If the <I>info</I> argument is
non-NULL, the <I>sigwaitinfo</I>() function shall be equivalent
to <I>sigwait</I>(), except that the selected signal number shall be
stored in the
<I>si_signo</I> member, and the cause of the signal shall be stored
in the <I>si_code</I> member. If any value is queued to the
selected signal, the first such queued value shall be dequeued and,
if the <I>info</I> argument is non-NULL, the value shall be
stored in the <I>si_value</I> member of <I>info</I>. The system resource
used to queue the signal shall be released and returned to
the system for other use. If no value is queued, the content of the
<I>si_value</I> member is undefined. If no further signals are
queued for the selected signal, the pending indication for that signal
shall be reset.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion (that is, one of the signals specified
by <I>set</I> is pending or is generated) <I>sigwaitinfo</I>()
and <I>sigtimedwait</I>() shall return the selected signal number.
Otherwise, the function shall return a value of -1 and set
<I>errno</I> to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>sigtimedwait</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
No signal specified by <I>set</I> was generated within the specified
timeout period.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>sigtimedwait</I>() and <I>sigwaitinfo</I>() functions may fail
if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The wait was interrupted by an unblocked, caught signal. It shall
be documented in system documentation whether this error
causes these functions to fail.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>sigtimedwait</I>() function may also fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The <I>timeout</I> argument specified a <I>tv_nsec</I> value less than
zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

An implementation only checks for this error if no signal is pending
in <I>set</I> and it is necessary to wait.
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

The <I>sigtimedwait</I>() function times out and returns an [EAGAIN]
error. Application writers should note that this is
inconsistent with other functions such as <I>pthread_cond_timedwait</I>()
that return [ETIMEDOUT].
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

Existing programming practice on realtime systems uses the ability
to pause waiting for a selected set of events and handle the
first event that occurs in-line instead of in a signal-handling function.
This allows applications to be written in an
event-directed style similar to a state machine. This style of programming
is useful for largescale transaction processing in which
the overall throughput of an application and the ability to clearly
track states are more important than the ability to minimize
the response time of individual event handling.
<P>

It is possible to construct a signal-waiting macro function out of
the realtime signal function mechanism defined in this volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. However, such a macro has to include the
definition of a generalized handler for all signals to
be waited on. A significant portion of the overhead of handler processing
can be avoided if the signal-waiting function is provided
by the kernel. This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 therefore provides
two signal-waiting functions-one that waits
indefinitely and one with a timeout-as part of the overall realtime
signal function specification.
<P>

The specification of a function with a timeout allows an application
to be written that can be broken out of a wait after a set
period of time if no event has occurred. It was argued that setting
a timer event before the wait and recognizing the timer event
in the wait would also implement the same functionality, but at a
lower performance level. Because of the performance degradation
associated with the user-level specification of a timer event and
the subsequent cancellation of that timer event after the wait
completes for a valid event, and the complexity associated with handling
potential race conditions associated with the user-level
method, the separate function has been included.
<P>

Note that the semantics of the <I>sigwaitinfo</I>() function are nearly
identical to that of the <I>sigwait</I>() function defined by this
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. The only
difference is that <I>sigwaitinfo</I>() returns the queued signal value
in the <I>value</I> argument. The return of the queued
value is required so that applications can differentiate between multiple
events queued to the same signal number.
<P>

The two distinct functions are being maintained because some implementations
may choose to implement the POSIX Threads Extension
functions and not implement the queued signals extensions. Note, though,
that <I>sigwaitinfo</I>() does not return the queued value
if the <I>value</I> argument is NULL, so the POSIX Threads Extension
<I>sigwait</I>()
function can be implemented as a macro on <I>sigwaitinfo</I>().
<P>

The <I>sigtimedwait</I>() function was separated from the <I>sigwaitinfo</I>()
function to address concerns regarding the
overloading of the <I>timeout</I> pointer to indicate indefinite wait
(no timeout), timed wait, and immediate return, and concerns
regarding consistency with other functions where the conditional and
timed waits were separate functions from the pure blocking
function. The semantics of <I>sigtimedwait</I>() are specified such
that <I>sigwaitinfo</I>() could be implemented as a macro with
a NULL pointer for <I>timeout</I>.
<P>

The <I>sigwait</I> functions provide a synchronous mechanism for threads
to wait for asynchronously-generated signals. One
important question was how many threads that are suspended in a call
to a <I>sigwait</I>()
function for a signal should return from the call when the signal
is sent. Four choices were considered:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
Return an error for multiple simultaneous calls to <I>sigwait</I> functions
for the same signal.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
One or more threads return.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
All waiting threads return.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 4.<DD>
Exactly one thread returns.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Prohibiting multiple calls to <I>sigwait</I>() for the same signal
was felt to be overly
restrictive. The &quot;one or more&quot; behavior made implementation of conforming
packages easy at the expense of forcing POSIX threads
clients to protect against multiple simultaneous calls to <I>sigwait</I>()
in application
code in order to achieve predictable behavior. There was concern that
the &quot;all waiting threads&quot; behavior would result in &quot;signal
broadcast storms&quot;, consuming excessive CPU resources by replicating
the signals in the general case. Furthermore, no convincing
examples could be presented that delivery to all was either simpler
or more powerful than delivery to one.
<P>

Thus, the consensus was that exactly one thread that was suspended
in a call to a <I>sigwait</I> function for a signal should
return when that signal occurs. This is not an onerous restriction
as:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
A multi-way signal wait can be built from the single-way wait.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Signals should only be handled by application-level code, as library
routines cannot guess what the application wants to do with
signals generated for the entire process.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Applications can thus arrange for a single thread to wait for any
given signal and call any needed routines upon its
arrival.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

In an application that is using signals for interprocess communication,
signal processing is typically done in one place.
Alternatively, if the signal is being caught so that process cleanup
can be done, the signal handler thread can call separate
process cleanup routines for each portion of the application. Since
the application main line started each portion of the
application, it is at the right abstraction level to tell each portion
of the application to clean up.
<P>

Certainly, there exist programming styles where it is logical to consider
waiting for a single signal in multiple threads. A
simple <I>sigwait_multiple</I>() routine can be constructed to achieve
this goal. A possible implementation would be to have each
<I>sigwait_multiple</I>() caller registered as having expressed interest
in a set of signals. The caller then waits on a
thread-specific condition variable. A single server thread calls a
<I>sigwait</I>()
function on the union of all registered signals. When the <I>sigwait</I>()
function
returns, the appropriate state is set and condition variables are
broadcast. New <I>sigwait_multiple</I>() callers may cause the
pending <I>sigwait</I>() call to be canceled and reissued in order
to update the set of
signals being waited for.
