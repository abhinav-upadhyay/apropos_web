chown - change owner and group of a file
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</A>&gt;
<BR>

<P>
int chown(const char *</B><I>path</I><B>, uid_t</B> <I>owner</I><B>, gid_t</B>
<I>group</I><B>);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>chown</I>() function shall change the user and group ownership
of a file.
<P>

The <I>path</I> argument points to a pathname naming a file. The user
ID and group ID of the named file shall be set to the
numeric values contained in <I>owner</I> and <I>group</I>, respectively.
<P>

Only processes with an effective user ID equal to the user ID of the
file or with appropriate privileges may change the
ownership of a file. If _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED is in effect for <I>path</I>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Changing the user ID is restricted to processes with appropriate privileges.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Changing the group ID is permitted to a process with an effective
user ID equal to the user ID of the file, but without
appropriate privileges, if and only if <I>owner</I> is equal to the
file's user ID or ( <B>uid_t</B>)-1 and <I>group</I> is equal
either to the calling process' effective group ID or to one of its
supplementary group IDs.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

If the specified file is a regular file, one or more of the S_IXUSR,
S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are set, and the
process does not have appropriate privileges, the set-user-ID (S_ISUID)
and set-group-ID (S_ISGID) bits of the file mode shall be
cleared upon successful return from <I>chown</I>(). If the specified
file is a regular file, one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP,
or S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are set, and the process has appropriate
privileges, it is implementation-defined whether the
set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are altered. If the <I>chown</I>()
function is successfully invoked on a file that is not a
regular file and one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits
of the file mode are set, the set-user-ID and set-group-ID
bits may be cleared.
<P>

If <I>owner</I> or <I>group</I> is specified as ( <B>uid_t</B>)-1 or
( <B>gid_t</B>)-1, respectively, the corresponding ID of
the file shall not be changed. If both owner and group are -1, the
times need not be updated.
<P>

Upon successful completion, <I>chown</I>() shall mark for update the
<I>st_ctime</I> field of the file.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned; otherwise, -1 shall
be returned and <I>errno</I> set to indicate the error. If
-1 is returned, no changes are made in the user ID and group ID of
the file.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>chown</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the
<I>path</I> argument.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
The length of the <I>path</I> argument exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname
component is longer than {NAME_MAX}.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A component of <I>path</I> does not name an existing file or <I>path</I>
is an empty string.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file, or the
calling process does not have appropriate privileges and
_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED indicates that such privilege is required.
<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
The named file resides on a read-only file system.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>chown</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred while reading or writing to the file system.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The <I>chown</I>() function was interrupted by a signal which was caught.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The owner or group ID supplied is not a value supported by the implementation.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution
of the <I>path</I> argument.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
As a result of encountering a symbolic link in resolution of the <I>path</I>
argument, the length of the substituted pathname
string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

Although <I>chown</I>() can be used on some implementations by the
file owner to change the owner and group to any desired
values, the only portable use of this function is to change the group
of a file to the effective GID of the calling process or to a
member of its group set.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

System III and System V allow a user to give away files; that is,
the owner of a file may change its user ID to anything. This
is a serious problem for implementations that are intended to meet
government security regulations. Version 7 and 4.3 BSD permit
only the superuser to change the user ID of a file. Some government
agencies (usually not ones concerned directly with security)
find this limitation too confining. This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
uses <I>may</I> to permit secure implementations
while not disallowing System V.
<P>

System III and System V allow the owner of a file to change the group
ID to anything. Version 7 permits only the superuser to
change the group ID of a file. 4.3 BSD permits the owner to change
the group ID of a file to its effective group ID or to any of
the groups in the list of supplementary group IDs, but to no others.
<P>

The POSIX.1-1990 standard requires that the <I>chown</I>() function
invoked by a non-appropriate privileged process clear the
S_ISGID and the S_ISUID bits for regular files, and permits them to
be cleared for other types of files. This is so that changes in
accessibility do not accidentally cause files to become security holes.
Unfortunately, requiring these bits to be cleared on
non-executable data files also clears the mandatory file locking bit
(shared with S_ISGID), which is an extension on many
implementations (it first appeared in System V). These bits should
only be required to be cleared on regular files that have one or
more of their execute bits set.
