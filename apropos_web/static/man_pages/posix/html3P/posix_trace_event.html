<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>posix_trace_event</I>() function shall record the <I>event_id</I>
and the user data pointed to by <I>data_ptr</I> in the
trace stream into which the calling process is being traced and in
which <I>event_id</I> is not filtered out. If the total size of
the user trace event data represented by <I>data_len</I> is not greater
than the declared maximum size for user trace event data,
then the <I>truncation-status</I> attribute of the trace event recorded
is POSIX_TRACE_NOT_TRUNCATED. Otherwise, the user trace
event data is truncated to this declared maximum size and the <I>truncation-status</I>
attribute of the trace event recorded is
POSIX_TRACE_TRUNCATED_RECORD.
<P>

If there is no trace stream created for the process or if the created
trace stream is not running, or if the trace event
specified by <I>event_id</I> is filtered out in the trace stream, the
<I>posix_trace_event</I>() function shall have no effect.
<P>

The <I>posix_trace_eventid_open</I>() function shall associate a user
trace event name with a trace event type identifier for
the calling process. The trace event name is the string pointed to
by the argument <I>event_name</I>. It shall have a maximum of
{TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} characters (which has the minimum value {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}).
The number of user trace event type
identifiers that can be defined for any given process is limited by
the maximum value {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}, which has the minimum
value {POSIX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}.
<P>

If the Trace Inherit option is not supported, the <I>posix_trace_eventid_open</I>()
function shall associate the user trace
event name pointed to by the <I>event_name</I> argument with a trace
event type identifier that is unique for the traced process,
and is returned in the variable pointed to by the <I>event_id</I> argument.
If the user trace event name has already been mapped
for the traced process, then the previously assigned trace event type
identifier shall be returned. If the per-process user trace
event name limit represented by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been reached,
the pre-defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see <I>Trace Option:
User Trace Event</I> ) user trace event shall be returned.
<P>

If the Trace Inherit option is supported, the <I>posix_trace_eventid_open</I>()
function shall associate the user trace event name
pointed to by the <I>event_name</I> argument with a trace event type
identifier that is unique for all the processes being traced
in this same trace stream, and is returned in the variable pointed
to by the <I>event_id</I> argument. If the user trace event name
has already been mapped for the traced processes, then the previously
assigned trace event type identifier shall be returned. If
the per-process user trace event name limit represented by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}
has been reached, the pre-defined
POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT ( <I>Trace Option: User Trace Event</I>
) user trace event
shall be returned. 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Note:</B><DD>
The above procedure, together with the fact that multiple processes
can only be traced into the same trace stream by
inheritance, ensure that all the processes that are traced into a
trace stream have the same mapping of trace event names to trace
event type identifiers.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

If there is no trace stream created, the <I>posix_trace_eventid_open</I>()
function shall store this information for future
trace streams created for this process.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

No return value is defined for the <I>posix_trace_event</I>() function.
<P>

Upon successful completion, the <I>posix_trace_eventid_open</I>() function
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, it shall
return the corresponding error number. The <I>posix_trace_eventid_open</I>()
function stores the trace event type identifier value
in the object pointed to by <I>event_id</I>, if successful.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>posix_trace_eventid_open</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
The size of the name pointed to by the <I>event_name</I> argument was
longer than the implementation-defined value
{TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}.
