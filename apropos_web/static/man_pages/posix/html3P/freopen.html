freopen - open a stream
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</A>&gt;
<BR>

<P>
FILE *freopen(const char *restrict</B> <I>filename</I><B>, const char
*restrict</B> <I>mode</I><B>,
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FILE *restrict</B> <I>stream</I><B>);
<BR>

</B>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>freopen</I>() function shall first attempt to flush the stream
and close any file descriptor associated with
<I>stream</I>. Failure to flush or close the file descriptor successfully
shall be ignored. The error and end-of-file indicators
for the stream shall be cleared.
<P>

The <I>freopen</I>() function shall open the file whose pathname is
the string pointed to by <I>filename</I> and associate the
stream pointed to by <I>stream</I> with it. The <I>mode</I> argument
shall be used just as in <I>fopen</I>().
<P>

The original stream shall be closed regardless of whether the subsequent
open succeeds.
<P>

If <I>filename</I> is a null pointer, the <I>freopen</I>() function
shall attempt to change the mode of the stream to that
specified by <I>mode</I>, as if the name of the file currently associated
with the stream had been used. It is
implementation-defined which changes of mode are permitted (if any),
and under what circumstances.
<P>

After a successful call to the <I>freopen</I>() function, the orientation
of the stream shall be cleared,  the encoding
rule shall be cleared,  and the associated <B>mbstate_t</B> object
shall be set to describe an initial conversion state.
<P>

The
largest value that can be represented correctly in an object of type
<B>off_t</B> shall be established as the offset maximum in the
open file description. 
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, <I>freopen</I>() shall return the value
of <I>stream</I>. Otherwise, a null pointer shall be
returned,  and <I>errno</I> shall be set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>freopen</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix, or
the file exists and the permissions specified by <I>mode</I> are
denied, or the file does not exist and write permission is denied
for the parent directory of the file to be created. 
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
A
signal was caught during <I>freopen</I>(). 
<DT><B>EISDIR</B>

<DD>
The named file is a directory and <I>mode</I> requires write access.
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
A
loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the
<I>path</I> argument. 
<DT><B>EMFILE</B>

<DD>
{OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in the calling process.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<P>
The length of the <I>filename</I> argument exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a
pathname component is longer than {NAME_MAX}. 
<DT><B>ENFILE</B>

<DD>
The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
A
component of <I>filename</I> does not name an existing file or <I>filename</I>
is an empty string. 
<DT><B>ENOSPC</B>

<DD>
The directory or file system that would contain the new file cannot
be expanded, the file does not exist, and it was to be created.
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A
component of the path prefix is not a directory. 
<DT><B>ENXIO</B>

<DD>
The named file is a character special or block special file, and the
device associated with this special file does not exist. 
<DT><B>EOVERFLOW</B>

<DD>
The named file is a regular file and the size of the file cannot be
represented correctly in an object of type <B>off_t</B>. 
<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
The named file resides on a read-only file system and <I>mode</I> requires
write access. 
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>freopen</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value of the <I>mode</I> argument is not valid. 
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>
More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution
of the <I>path</I> argument. 
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
<P>
Pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result
whose length exceeds {PATH_MAX}. 
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient storage space is available. 
<DT><B>ENXIO</B>

<DD>
A
request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside
the capabilities of the device. 
<DT><B>ETXTBSY</B>

<DD>
The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is being executed
and <I>mode</I> requires write access.
