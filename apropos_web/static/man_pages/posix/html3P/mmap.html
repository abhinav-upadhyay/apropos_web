<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>mmap</i>() function shall establish a mapping between a process' address space and a file, shared memory object, or &#160;typed memory object.  The format of the call is as follows:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>mmap</i>() function shall establish a mapping between the address space of the process at an address  <i>pa</i> for  <i>len</i> bytes to the memory object represented by the file descriptor  <i>fildes</i> at offset <i>off</i> for <i>len</i> bytes. The value of  <i>pa</i> is an implementation-defined function of the parameter  <i>addr</i> and the values of <i>flags</i>, further described below. A successful  <i>mmap</i>() call shall return <i>pa</i> as its result. The address range starting at  <i>pa</i> and continuing for  <i>len</i> bytes shall be legitimate for the possible (not necessarily current) address space of the process. The range of bytes starting at  <i>off</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes shall be legitimate for the possible (not necessarily current) offsets in the file, shared memory object, or  typed memory object represented by  <i>fildes</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, the memory object to be mapped shall be that portion of the typed memory object allocated by the implementation as specified below. In this case, if  <i>off</i> is non-zero, the behavior of  <i>mmap</i>() is undefined. If  <i>fildes</i> refers to a valid typed memory object that is not accessible from the calling process,  <i>mmap</i>() shall fail.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The mapping established by <i>mmap</i>() shall replace any previous mappings for those whole pages containing any part of the address space of the process starting at  <i>pa</i> and continuing for  <i>len</i> bytes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the size of the mapped file changes after the call to <i>mmap</i>() as a result of some other operation on the mapped file, the effect of references to portions of the mapped region that correspond to added or removed portions of the file is unspecified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>mmap</i>() function shall be supported for regular files, shared memory objects, and  typed memory objects.  Support for any other type of file is unspecified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The parameter <i>prot</i> determines whether read, write, execute, or some combination of accesses are permitted to the data being mapped. The  <i>prot</i> shall be either PROT_NONE or the bitwise-inclusive OR of one or more of the other flags in the following table, defined in the  <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i> header.<table class="tbl">

Implementations that do not support the Memory Mapped Files option are not required to support MAP_PRIVATE.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is implementation-defined whether MAP_FIXED shall be supported. &#160;MAP_FIXED shall be supported on XSI-conformant systems.<div class="spacer">
</div>
MAP_SHARED and MAP_PRIVATE describe the disposition of write references to the memory object. If MAP_SHARED is specified, write references shall change the underlying object. If MAP_PRIVATE is specified, modifications to the mapped data by the calling process shall be visible only to the calling process and shall not change the underlying object. It is unspecified whether modifications to the underlying object done after the MAP_PRIVATE mapping is established are visible through the MAP_PRIVATE mapping. Either MAP_SHARED or MAP_PRIVATE can be specified, but not both. The mapping type is retained across  <i>fork</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag,  <i>mmap</i>() shall, if there are enough resources available, map  <i>len</i> bytes allocated from the corresponding typed memory object which were not previously allocated to any process in any processor that may access that typed memory object. If there are not enough resources available, the function shall fail. If  <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, these allocated bytes shall be contiguous within the typed memory object. If  <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag, these allocated bytes may be composed of non-contiguous fragments within the typed memory object. If  <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with neither the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag nor the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag,  <i>len</i> bytes starting at offset  <i>off</i> within the typed memory object are mapped, exactly as when mapping a file or shared memory object. In this case, if two processes map an area of typed memory using the same  <i>off</i> and  <i>len</i> values and using file descriptors that refer to the same memory pool (either from the same port or from a different port), both processes shall map the same region of storage.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When MAP_FIXED is set in the <i>flags</i> argument, the implementation is informed that the value of  <i>pa</i> shall be  <i>addr</i>, exactly. If MAP_FIXED is set, <i>mmap</i>() may return MAP_FAILED and set  <i>errno</i> to [EINVAL]. If a MAP_FIXED request is successful, the mapping established by  <i>mmap</i>() replaces any previous mappings for the process' pages in the range [ <i>pa</i>,<i>pa</i>+<i>len</i>).<div class="spacer">
</div>
When MAP_FIXED is not set, the implementation uses <i>addr</i> in an implementation-defined manner to arrive at  <i>pa</i>. The  <i>pa</i> so chosen shall be an area of the address space that the implementation deems suitable for a mapping of  <i>len</i> bytes to the file. All implementations interpret an  <i>addr</i> value of 0 as granting the implementation complete freedom in selecting  <i>pa</i>, subject to constraints described below. A non-zero value of  <i>addr</i> is taken to be a suggestion of a process address near which the mapping should be placed. When the implementation selects a value for  <i>pa</i>, it never places a mapping at address 0, nor does it replace any extant mapping.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>off</i> argument is constrained to be aligned and sized according to the value returned by  <i>sysconf</i>() when passed _SC_PAGESIZE or _SC_PAGE_SIZE. When MAP_FIXED is specified, the application shall ensure that the argument  <i>addr</i> also meets these constraints. The implementation performs mapping operations over whole pages. Thus, while the argument  <i>len</i> need not meet a size or alignment constraint, the implementation shall include, in any mapping operation, any partial page specified by the range [ <i>pa</i>,<i>pa</i>+<i>len</i>).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The system shall always zero-fill any partial page at the end of an object. Further, the system shall never write out any modified portions of the last page of an object which are beyond its end.  References within the address range starting at  <i>pa</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes to whole pages following the end of an object shall result in delivery of a SIGBUS signal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An implementation may generate SIGBUS signals when a reference would cause an error in the mapped object, such as out-of-space condition.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>mmap</i>() function shall add an extra reference to the file associated with the file descriptor  <i>fildes</i> which is not removed by a subsequent  <i>close</i>() on that file descriptor. This reference shall be removed when there are no more mappings to the file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>st_atime</i> field of the mapped file may be marked for update at any time between the  <i>mmap</i>() call and the corresponding  <i>munmap</i>() call. The initial read or write reference to a mapped region shall cause the file's  <i>st_atime</i> field to be marked for update if it has not already been marked for update.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>st_ctime</i> and <i>st_mtime</i> fields of a file that is mapped with MAP_SHARED and PROT_WRITE shall be marked for update at some point in the interval between a write reference to the mapped region and the next call to  <i>msync</i>() with MS_ASYNC or MS_SYNC for that portion of the file by any process. If there is no such call and if the underlying file is modified as a result of a write reference, then these fields shall be marked for update at some time after the write reference.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There may be implementation-defined limits on the number of memory regions that can be mapped (per process or per system).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If such a limit is imposed, whether the number of memory regions that can be mapped by a process is decreased by the use of  <i>shmat</i>() is implementation-defined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>mmap</i>() fails for reasons other than [EBADF], [EINVAL], or [ENOTSUP], some of the mappings in the address range starting at  <i>addr</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes may have been unmapped.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion, the  <i>mmap</i>() function shall return the address at which the mapping was placed (  <i>pa</i>); otherwise, it shall return a value of MAP_FAILED and set  <i>errno</i> to indicate the error.

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> Use of  <i>mmap</i>() may reduce the amount of memory available to other memory allocation functions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Use of MAP_FIXED may result in unspecified behavior in further use of  <i>malloc</i>() and  <i>shmat</i>(). The use of MAP_FIXED is discouraged, as it may prevent an implementation from making the most effective use of resources.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The application must ensure correct synchronization when using <i>mmap</i>() in conjunction with any other file access method, such as  <i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>(), standard input/output, and  <i>shmat</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>mmap</i>() function allows access to resources via address space manipulations, instead of  <i>read</i>()/ <i>write</i>(). Once a file is mapped, all a process has to do to access it is use the data at the address to which the file was mapped. So, using pseudo-code to illustrate the way in which an existing program might be changed to use  <i>mmap</i>(), the following:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> After considering several other alternatives, it was decided to adopt the  <i>mmap</i>() definition found in SVR4 for mapping memory objects into process address spaces. The SVR4 definition is minimal, in that it describes only what has been built, and what appears to be necessary for a general and portable mapping facility.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that while <i>mmap</i>() was first designed for mapping files, it is actually a general-purpose mapping facility. It can be used to map any appropriate object, such as memory, files, devices, and so on, into the address space of a process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a mapping is established, it is possible that the implementation may need to map more than is requested into the address space of the process because of hardware requirements. An application, however, cannot count on this behavior. Implementations that do not use a paged architecture may simply allocate a common memory region and return the address of it; such implementations probably do not allocate any more than is necessary. References past the end of the requested area are unspecified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If an application requests a mapping that would overlay existing mappings in the process, it might be desirable that an implementation detect this and inform the application. However, the default, portable (not MAP_FIXED) operation does not overlay existing mappings. On the other hand, if the program specifies a fixed address mapping (which requires some implementation knowledge to determine a suitable address, if the function is supported at all), then the program is presumed to be successfully managing its own address space and should be trusted when it asks to map over existing data structures. Furthermore, it is also desirable to make as few system calls as possible, and it might be considered onerous to require an  <i>munmap</i>() before an <i>mmap</i>() to the same address range. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 specifies that the new mappings replace any existing mappings, following existing practice in this regard.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is not expected, when the Memory Protection option is supported, that all hardware implementations are able to support all combinations of permissions at all addresses. When this option is supported, implementations are required to disallow write access to mappings without write permission and to disallow access to mappings without any access permission. Other than these restrictions, implementations may allow access types other than those requested by the application. For example, if the application requests only PROT_WRITE, the implementation may also allow read access. A call to  <i>mmap</i>() fails if the implementation cannot support allowing all the access requested by the application. For example, some implementations cannot support a request for both write access and execute access simultaneously. All implementations supporting the Memory Protection option must support requests for no access, read access, write access, and both read and write access. Strictly conforming code must only rely on the required checks. These restrictions allow for portability across a wide range of hardware.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The MAP_FIXED address treatment is likely to fail for non-page-aligned values and for certain architecture-dependent address ranges. Conforming implementations cannot count on being able to choose address values for MAP_FIXED without utilizing non-portable, implementation-defined knowledge. Nonetheless, MAP_FIXED is provided as a standard interface conforming to existing practice for utilizing such knowledge when it is available.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Similarly, in order to allow implementations that do not support virtual addresses, support for directly specifying any mapping addresses via MAP_FIXED is not required and thus a conforming application may not count on it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The MAP_PRIVATE function can be implemented efficiently when memory protection hardware is available. When such hardware is not available, implementations can implement such &quot;mappings&quot; by simply making a real copy of the relevant data into process private memory, though this tends to behave similarly to  <i>read</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The function has been defined to allow for many different models of using shared memory. However, all uses are not equally portable across all machine architectures. In particular, the  <i>mmap</i>() function allows the system as well as the application to specify the address at which to map a specific region of a memory object. The most portable way to use the function is always to let the system choose the address, specifying NULL as the value for the argument  <i>addr</i> and not to specify MAP_FIXED.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If it is intended that a particular region of a memory object be mapped at the same address in a group of processes (on machines where this is even possible), then MAP_FIXED can be used to pass in the desired mapping address. The system can still be used to choose the desired address if the first such mapping is made without specifying MAP_FIXED, and then the resulting mapping address can be passed to subsequent processes for them to pass in via MAP_FIXED. The availability of a specific address range cannot be guaranteed, in general.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>mmap</i>() function can be used to map a region of memory that is larger than the current size of the object. Memory access within the mapping but beyond the current end of the underlying objects may result in SIGBUS signals being sent to the process. The reason for this is that the size of the object can be manipulated by other processes and can change at any moment. The implementation should tell the application that a memory reference is outside the object where this can be detected; otherwise, written data may be lost and read data may not reflect actual data in the object.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that references beyond the end of the object do not extend the object as the new end cannot be determined precisely by most virtual memory hardware. Instead, the size can be directly manipulated by  <i>ftruncate</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
Process memory locking does apply to shared memory regions, and the MEMLOCK_FUTURE argument to  <i>mlockall</i>() can be relied upon to cause new shared memory regions to be automatically locked.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Existing implementations of <i>mmap</i>() return the value -1 when unsuccessful. Since the casting of this value to type  <b>void</b>  <b>*</b> cannot be guaranteed by the ISO&#160;C standard to be distinct from a successful value, this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 defines the symbol MAP_FAILED, which a conforming implementation does not return as the result of a successful call.</div>
