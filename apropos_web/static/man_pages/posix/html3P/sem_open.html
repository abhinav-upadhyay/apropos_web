<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>sem_open</I>() function shall establish a connection between
a named semaphore and a process. Following a call to
<I>sem_open</I>() with semaphore name <I>name</I>, the process may reference
the semaphore associated with <I>name</I> using the
address returned from the call. This semaphore may be used in subsequent
calls to <I>sem_wait</I>(), <I>sem_trywait</I>(), <I>sem_post</I>(),
and <I>sem_close</I>(). The semaphore
remains usable by this process until the semaphore is closed by a
successful call to <I>sem_close</I>(), <I>_exit</I>(), or one of the
<I>exec</I> functions.
<P>

The <I>oflag</I> argument controls whether the semaphore is created
or merely accessed by the call to <I>sem_open</I>(). The
following flag bits may be set in <I>oflag</I>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>O_CREAT<DD>
This flag is used to create a semaphore if it does not already exist.
If O_CREAT is set and the semaphore already exists, then
O_CREAT has no effect, except as noted under O_EXCL. Otherwise, <I>sem_open</I>()
creates a named semaphore. The O_CREAT flag
requires a third and a fourth argument: <I>mode</I>, which is of type
<B>mode_t</B>, and <I>value</I>, which is of type
<B>unsigned</B>. The semaphore is created with an initial value of
<I>value</I>. Valid initial values for semaphores are less than
or equal to {SEM_VALUE_MAX}. 
</DL>
<P>

The user ID of the semaphore is set to the effective user ID of the
process; the group ID of the semaphore is set to a system
default group ID or to the effective group ID of the process. The
permission bits of the semaphore are set to the value of the
<I>mode</I> argument except those set in the file mode creation mask
of the process. When bits in <I>mode</I> other than the file
permission bits are specified, the effect is unspecified.
<P>

After the semaphore named <I>name</I> has been created by <I>sem_open</I>()
with the O_CREAT flag, other processes can connect
to the semaphore by calling <I>sem_open</I>() with the same value of
<I>name</I>.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>O_EXCL<DD>
If O_EXCL and O_CREAT are set, <I>sem_open</I>() fails if the semaphore
<I>name</I> exists. The check for the existence of the
semaphore and the creation of the semaphore if it does not exist are
atomic with respect to other processes executing
<I>sem_open</I>() with O_EXCL and O_CREAT set. If O_EXCL is set and
O_CREAT is not set, the effect is undefined. 
</DL>
<P>

If flags other than O_CREAT and O_EXCL are specified in the <I>oflag</I>
parameter, the effect is unspecified.
<P>
<P>

The <I>name</I> argument points to a string naming a semaphore object.
It is unspecified whether the name appears in the file
system and is visible to functions that take pathnames as arguments.
The <I>name</I> argument conforms to the construction rules
for a pathname. If <I>name</I> begins with the slash character, then
processes calling <I>sem_open</I>() with the same value of
<I>name</I> shall refer to the same semaphore object, as long as that
name has not been removed. If <I>name</I> does not begin with
the slash character, the effect is implementation-defined. The interpretation
of slash characters other than the leading slash
character in <I>name</I> is implementation-defined.
<P>

If a process makes multiple successful calls to <I>sem_open</I>() with
the same value for <I>name</I>, the same semaphore
address shall be returned for each such successful call, provided
that there have been no calls to <I>sem_unlink</I>() for this semaphore.
<P>

References to copies of the semaphore produce undefined results.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, the <I>sem_open</I>() function shall return
the address of the semaphore. Otherwise, it shall return
a value of SEM_FAILED and set <I>errno</I> to indicate the error. The
symbol SEM_FAILED is defined in the <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/semaphore.h">semaphore.h</A>&gt;</I> header. No
successful return from <I>sem_open</I>() shall return the
value SEM_FAILED.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

If any of the following conditions occur, the <I>sem_open</I>() function
shall return SEM_FAILED and set <I>errno</I> to the
corresponding value:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
The named semaphore exists and the permissions specified by <I>oflag</I>
are denied, or the named semaphore does not exist and
permission to create the named semaphore is denied.
<DT><B>EEXIST</B>

<DD>
O_CREAT and O_EXCL are set and the named semaphore already exists.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The <I>sem_open</I>() operation was interrupted by a signal.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The <I>sem_open</I>() operation is not supported for the given name,
or O_CREAT was specified in <I>oflag</I> and <I>value</I>
was greater than {SEM_VALUE_MAX}.
<DT><B>EMFILE</B>

<DD>
Too many semaphore descriptors or file descriptors are currently in
use by this process.
<DT><B>ENAMETOOLONG</B>

<DD>
The length of the <I>name</I> argument exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname
component is longer than {NAME_MAX}.
<DT><B>ENFILE</B>

<DD>
Too many semaphores are currently open in the system.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
O_CREAT is not set and the named semaphore does not exist.
<DT><B>ENOSPC</B>

<DD>
There is insufficient space for the creation of the new named semaphore.

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

The <I>sem_open</I>() function is part of the Semaphores option and
need not be available on all implementations.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

Early drafts required an error return value of -1 with the type <B>sem_t
*</B> for the <I>sem_open</I>() function, which is not
guaranteed to be portable across implementations. The revised text
provides the symbolic error code SEM_FAILED to eliminate the
type conflict.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>

<P>

None.
