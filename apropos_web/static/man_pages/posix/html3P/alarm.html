<h1>NAME</h1> alarm - schedule an alarm signal</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>  <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
unsigned alarm(unsigned<b> </b><i>seconds</i><b></b><b>);</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b></b></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>alarm</i>() function shall cause the system to generate a SIGALRM signal for the process after the number of realtime seconds specified by  <i>seconds</i> have elapsed. Processor scheduling delays may prevent the process from handling the signal as soon as it is generated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>seconds</i> is 0, a pending alarm request, if any, is canceled.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Alarm requests are not stacked; only one SIGALRM generation can be scheduled in this manner. If the SIGALRM signal has not yet been generated, the call shall result in rescheduling the time at which the SIGALRM signal is generated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Interactions between <i>alarm</i>() and any of <i>setitimer</i>(), <i>ualarm</i>(), or  <i>usleep</i>() are unspecified.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> If there is a previous  <i>alarm</i>() request with time remaining,  <i>alarm</i>() shall return a non-zero value that is the number of seconds until the previous request would have generated a SIGALRM signal. Otherwise,  <i>alarm</i>() shall return 0.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>alarm</i>() function is always successful, and no return value is reserved to indicate an error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> The  <i>fork</i>() function clears pending alarms in the child process. A new process image created by one of the  <i>exec</i> functions inherits the time left to an alarm signal in the old process' image.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Application writers should note that the type of the argument <i>seconds</i> and the return value of  <i>alarm</i>() is  <b>unsigned</b>. That means that a Strictly Conforming POSIX System Interfaces Application cannot pass a value greater than the minimum guaranteed value for {UINT_MAX}, which the ISO&#160;C standard sets as 65535, and any application passing a larger value is restricting its portability. A different type was considered, but historical implementations, including those with a 16-bit  <b>int</b> type, consistently use either <b>unsigned</b> or <b>int</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Application writers should be aware of possible interactions when the same process uses both the  <i>alarm</i>() and <i>sleep</i>() functions.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> Many historical implementations (including Version 7 and System V) allow an alarm to occur up to a second early. Other implementations allow alarms up to half a second or one clock tick early or do not allow them to occur early at all. The latter is considered most appropriate, since it gives the most predictable behavior, especially since the signal can always be delayed for an indefinite amount of time due to scheduling. Applications can thus choose the  <i>seconds</i> argument as the minimum amount of time they wish to have elapse before the signal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The term &quot;realtime&quot; here and elsewhere ( <i>sleep</i>(), <i>times</i>()) is intended to mean &quot;wall clock&quot; time as common English usage, and has nothing to do with &quot;realtime operating systems&quot;. It is in contrast to  <i>virtual</i>  <i>time</i>, which could be misinterpreted if just <i>time</i> were used.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In some implementations, including 4.3 BSD, very large values of the  <i>seconds</i> argument are silently rounded down to an implementation-defined maximum value. This maximum is large enough (to the order of several months) that the effect is not noticeable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There were two possible choices for alarm generation in multi-threaded applications: generation for the calling thread or generation for the process. The first option would not have been particularly useful since the alarm state is maintained on a per-process basis and the alarm that is established by the last invocation of  <i>alarm</i>() is the only one that would be active.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Furthermore, allowing generation of an asynchronous signal for a thread would have introduced an exception to the overall signal model. This requires a compelling reason in order to be justified.</div>
