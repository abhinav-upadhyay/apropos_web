fopen - open a stream
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</A>&gt;
<BR>

<P>
FILE *fopen(const char *restrict</B> <I>filename</I><B>, const char
*restrict</B> <I>mode</I><B>);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>fopen</I>() function shall open the file whose pathname is the
string pointed to by <I>filename</I>, and associates a
stream with it.
<P>

The <I>mode</I> argument points to a string. If the string is one of
the following, the file shall be opened in the indicated
mode. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>r</I>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<I>rb</I><DD>
Open file for reading.
<DT><I>w</I>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<I>wb</I><DD>
Truncate to zero length or create file for writing.
<DT><I>a</I>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<I>ab</I><DD>
Append; open or create file for writing at end-of-file.
<DT><I>r+</I>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<I>rb+</I>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<I>r+b</I><DD>
Open file for update (reading and writing).
<DT><I>w+</I>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<I>wb+</I>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<I>w+b</I><DD>
Truncate to zero length or create file for update.
<DT><I>a+</I>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<I>ab+</I>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<I>a+b</I><DD>
Append; open or create file for update, writing at end-of-file.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The
character <B>'b'</B> shall have no effect, but is allowed for ISO&nbsp;C
standard conformance.  Opening a file with read mode (<I>r</I> as the
first character in the <I>mode</I> argument) shall
fail if the file does not exist or cannot be read.
<P>

Opening a file with append mode (<I>a</I> as the first character in
the <I>mode</I> argument) shall cause all subsequent writes
to the file to be forced to the then current end-of-file, regardless
of intervening calls to <I>fseek</I>().
<P>

When a file is opened with update mode ( <B>'+'</B> as the second or
third character in the <I>mode</I> argument), both input
and output may be performed on the associated stream. However, the
application shall ensure that output is not directly followed by
input without an intervening call to <I>fflush</I>() or to a file positioning
function ( <I>fseek</I>(), <I>fsetpos</I>(), or <I>rewind</I>()), and
input is not directly followed by output without an intervening call
to a file
positioning function, unless the input operation encounters end-of-file.
<P>

When opened, a stream is fully buffered if and only if it can be determined
not to refer to an interactive device. The error and
end-of-file indicators for the stream shall be cleared.
<P>

If
<I>mode</I> is <I>w</I>, <I>wb</I>, <I>a</I>, <I>ab</I>, <I>w</I>+, <I>wb</I>+,
<I>w</I>+<I>b</I>, <I>a</I>+, <I>ab</I>+, or
<I>a</I>+<I>b</I>, and the file did not previously exist, upon successful
completion, the <I>fopen</I>() function shall mark for
update the <I>st_atime</I>, <I>st_ctime</I>, and <I>st_mtime</I> fields
of the file and the <I>st_ctime</I> and <I>st_mtime</I>
fields of the parent directory.
<P>

If <I>mode</I> is <I>w</I>, <I>wb</I>, <I>w</I>+, <I>wb</I>+, or <I>w</I>+<I>b</I>,
and the file did previously exist, upon
successful completion, <I>fopen</I>() shall mark for update the <I>st_ctime</I>
and <I>st_mtime</I> fields of the file. The
<I>fopen</I>() function shall allocate a file descriptor as <I>open</I>()
does. 
<P>

After a successful call to the <I>fopen</I>() function, the orientation
of the stream shall be cleared,  the encoding
rule shall be cleared,  and the associated <B>mbstate_t</B> object
shall be set to describe an initial conversion state.
<P>

The
largest value that can be represented correctly in an object of type
<B>off_t</B> shall be established as the offset maximum in the
open file description. 
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, <I>fopen</I>() shall return a pointer to
the object controlling the stream. Otherwise, a null
pointer shall be returned,  and <I>errno</I> shall be set to indicate
the error. 
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>fopen</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix, or
the file exists and the permissions specified by <I>mode</I> are
denied, or the file does not exist and write permission is denied
for the parent directory of the file to be created. 
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
A
signal was caught during <I>fopen</I>(). 
<DT><B>EISDIR</B>

<DD>
The named file is a directory and <I>mode</I> requires write access.

pathname component is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>

is an empty string. 
<DT><B>ENOSPC</B>

<DD>

be expanded, the file does not exist, and the file was to be
created. 
<DT><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
A
component of the path prefix is not a directory. 
<DT><B>ENXIO</B>

<DD>
The named file is a character special or block special file, and the
device associated with this special file does not exist. 
<DT><B>EOVERFLOW</B>

<DD>
The named file is a regular file and the size of the file cannot be
represented correctly in an object of type <B>off_t</B>. 
<DT><B>EROFS</B>

<DD>
The named file resides on a read-only file system and <I>mode</I> requires
write access. 
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>fopen</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value of the <I>mode</I> argument is not valid. 
<DT><B>ELOOP</B>

<DD>

<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient storage space is available. 
<DT><B>ETXTBSY</B>

<DD>
The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is being executed
and <I>mode</I> requires write access.

<H3>Opening a File</H3>

<P>

The following example tries to open the file named <B>file</B> for
reading. The <I>fopen</I>() function returns a file pointer
that is used in subsequent <I>fgets</I>() and <I>fclose</I>() calls.
If the program cannot open the file, it just ignores it.
