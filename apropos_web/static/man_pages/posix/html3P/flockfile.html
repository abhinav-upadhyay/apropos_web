flockfile, ftrylockfile, funlockfile - stdio locking functions

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

These functions shall provide for explicit application-level locking
of stdio ( <B>FILE *</B>) objects. These functions can be
used by a thread to delineate a sequence of I/O statements that are
executed as a unit.
<P>

The <I>flockfile</I>() function shall acquire for a thread ownership
of a ( <B>FILE *</B>) object.
<P>

The <I>ftrylockfile</I>() function shall acquire for a thread ownership
of a ( <B>FILE *</B>) object if the object is available;
<I>ftrylockfile</I>() is a non-blocking version of <I>flockfile</I>().
<P>

The <I>funlockfile</I>() function shall relinquish the ownership granted
to the thread. The behavior is undefined if a thread
other than the current owner calls the <I>funlockfile</I>() function.
<P>

The functions shall behave as if there is a lock count associated
with each ( <B>FILE *</B>) object. This count is implicitly
initialized to zero when the ( <B>FILE *</B>) object is created. The
( <B>FILE *</B>) object is unlocked when the count is zero.
When the count is positive, a single thread owns the ( <B>FILE *</B>)
object. When the <I>flockfile</I>() function is called, if
the count is zero or if the count is positive and the caller owns
the ( <B>FILE *</B>) object, the count shall be incremented.
Otherwise, the calling thread shall be suspended, waiting for the
count to return to zero. Each call to <I>funlockfile</I>() shall
decrement the count. This allows matching calls to <I>flockfile</I>()
(or successful calls to <I>ftrylockfile</I>()) and
<I>funlockfile</I>() to be nested.
<P>

All functions that reference ( <B>FILE *</B>) objects shall behave
as if they use <I>flockfile</I>() and <I>funlockfile</I>()
internally to obtain ownership of these ( <B>FILE *</B>) objects.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

None for <I>flockfile</I>() and <I>funlockfile</I>().
<P>

The <I>ftrylockfile</I>() function shall return zero for success and
non-zero to indicate that the lock cannot be acquired.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

No errors are defined.
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

Applications using these functions may be subject to priority inversion,
as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 3.285, Priority Inversion.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

The <I>flockfile</I>() and <I>funlockfile</I>() functions provide an
orthogonal mutual-exclusion lock for each <B>FILE</B>. The
<I>ftrylockfile</I>() function provides a non-blocking attempt to acquire
a file lock, analogous to <I>pthread_mutex_trylock</I>().
<P>

These locks behave as if they are the same as those used internally
by <I>stdio</I> for thread-safety. This both provides
thread-safety of these functions without requiring a second level
of internal locking and allows functions in <I>stdio</I> to be
implemented in terms of other <I>stdio</I> functions.
<P>

Application writers and implementors should be aware that there are
potential deadlock problems on <B>FILE</B> objects. For
example, the line-buffered flushing semantics of <I>stdio</I> (requested
via {_IOLBF}) require that certain input operations
sometimes cause the buffered contents of implementation-defined line-buffered
output streams to be flushed. If two threads each
hold the lock on the other's <B>FILE</B>, deadlock ensues. This type
of deadlock can be avoided by acquiring <B>FILE</B> locks in a
consistent order. In particular, the line-buffered output stream deadlock
can typically be avoided by acquiring locks on input
streams before locks on output streams if a thread would be acquiring
both.
<P>

In summary, threads sharing <I>stdio</I> streams with other threads
can use <I>flockfile</I>() and <I>funlockfile</I>() to cause
sequences of I/O performed by a single thread to be kept bundled.
The only case where the use of <I>flockfile</I>() and
<I>funlockfile</I>() is required is to provide a scope protecting uses
of the
<I>*_unlocked</I>() functions/macros. This moves the cost/performance
tradeoff to the optimal
point.
