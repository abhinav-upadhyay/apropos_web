pthread_join - wait for thread termination

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>pthread_join</I>() function shall suspend execution of the calling
thread until the target <I>thread</I> terminates,
unless the target <I>thread</I> has already terminated. On return from
a successful <I>pthread_join</I>() call with a non-NULL
<I>value_ptr</I> argument, the value passed to <I>pthread_exit</I>()
by the
terminating thread shall be made available in the location referenced
by <I>value_ptr</I>. When a <I>pthread_join</I>() returns
successfully, the target thread has been terminated. The results of
multiple simultaneous calls to <I>pthread_join</I>() specifying
the same target thread are undefined. If the thread calling <I>pthread_join</I>()
is canceled, then the target thread shall not be
detached.
<P>

It is unspecified whether a thread that has exited but remains unjoined
counts against {PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX}.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

If successful, the <I>pthread_join</I>() function shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>pthread_join</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The implementation has detected that the value specified by <I>thread</I>
does not refer to a joinable thread.
<DT><B>ESRCH</B>

<DD>
No thread could be found corresponding to that specified by the given
thread ID.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>pthread_join</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EDEADLK</B>

<DD>
A deadlock was detected or the value of <I>thread</I> specifies the
calling thread.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>pthread_join</I>() function shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].
<P>

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

An example of thread creation and deletion follows:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>typedef struct {
    int *ar;
    long n;
} subarray;


void *
incer(void *arg)

    long i;


    for (i = 0; i &lt; ((subarray *)arg)-&gt;n; i++)
        ((subarray *)arg)-&gt;ar[i]++;
}


int main(void)
{
    int        ar[1000000];
    pthread_t  th1, th2;
    subarray   sb1, sb2;


    sb1.ar = &amp;ar[0];
    sb1.n  = 500000;
    (void) pthread_create(&amp;th1, NULL, incer, &amp;sb1);


    sb2.ar = &amp;ar[500000];
    sb2.n  = 500000;
    (void) pthread_create(&amp;th2, NULL, incer, &amp;sb2);


    (void) pthread_join(th1, NULL);
    (void) pthread_join(th2, NULL);
    return 0;

<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

The <I>pthread_join</I>() function is a convenience that has proven
useful in multi-threaded applications. It is true that a
programmer could simulate this function if it were not provided by
passing extra state as part of the argument to the
<I>start_routine</I>(). The terminating thread would set a flag to
indicate termination and broadcast a condition that is part of
that state; a joining thread would wait on that condition variable.
While such a technique would allow a thread to wait on more
complex conditions (for example, waiting for multiple threads to terminate),
waiting on individual thread termination is considered
widely useful. Also, including the <I>pthread_join</I>() function in
no way precludes a programmer from coding such complex waits.
Thus, while not a primitive, including <I>pthread_join</I>() in this
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 was considered
valuable.
<P>

The <I>pthread_join</I>() function provides a simple mechanism allowing
an application to wait for a thread to terminate. After
the thread terminates, the application may then choose to clean up
resources that were used by the thread. For instance, after
<I>pthread_join</I>() returns, any application-provided stack storage
could be reclaimed.
<P>

The <I>pthread_join</I>() or <I>pthread_detach</I>() function should
eventually
be called for every thread that is created with the <I>detachstate</I>
attribute set to PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE so that storage
associated with the thread may be reclaimed.
<P>

The interaction between <I>pthread_join</I>() and cancellation is well-defined
for the following reasons:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The <I>pthread_join</I>() function, like all other non-async-cancel-safe
functions, can only be called with deferred
cancelability type.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Cancellation cannot occur in the disabled cancelability state.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Thus, only the default cancelability state need be considered. As
specified, either the <I>pthread_join</I>() call is canceled,
or it succeeds, but not both. The difference is obvious to the application,
since either a cancellation handler is run or
<I>pthread_join</I>() returns. There are no race conditions since <I>pthread_join</I>()
was called in the deferred cancelability
state.
