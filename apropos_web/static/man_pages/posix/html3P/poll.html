poll - input/output multiplexing

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>poll</I>() function provides applications with a mechanism for
multiplexing input/output over a set of file descriptors.
For each member of the array pointed to by <I>fds</I>, <I>poll</I>()
shall examine the given file descriptor for the event(s)
specified in <I>events</I>. The number of <B>pollfd</B> structures in
the <I>fds</I> array is specified by <I>nfds</I>. The
<I>poll</I>() function shall identify those file descriptors on which
an application can read or write data, or on which certain
events have occurred.
<P>

The <I>fds</I> argument specifies the file descriptors to be examined
and the events of interest for each file descriptor. It is
a pointer to an array with one member for each open file descriptor
of interest. The array's members are <B>pollfd</B> structures
within which <I>fd</I> specifies an open file descriptor and <I>events</I>
and <I>revents</I> are bitmasks constructed by OR'ing a
combination of the following event flags:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>POLLIN<DD>
Data other than high-priority data may be read without blocking. 
</DL>
<P>

For STREAMS, this flag is set in <I>revents</I> even if the message
is of zero length. This flag shall be equivalent to POLLRDNORM
| POLLRDBAND. 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>POLLRDNORM<DD>
Normal data may be read without blocking. 
</DL>
<P>

For STREAMS, data on priority band 0 may be read without blocking.
This flag is set in <I>revents</I> even if the message is of
zero length. 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>POLLRDBAND<DD>
Priority data may be read without blocking. 
</DL>
<P>

For STREAMS, data on priority bands greater than 0 may be read without
blocking. This flag is set in <I>revents</I> even if the
message is of zero length. 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>POLLPRI<DD>
High-priority data may be read without blocking. 
</DL>
<P>

For STREAMS, this flag is set in <I>revents</I> even if the message
is of zero length. 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>POLLOUT<DD>
Normal data may be written without blocking. 
</DL>
<P>

For STREAMS, data on priority band 0 may be written without blocking.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>POLLWRNORM<DD>
Equivalent to POLLOUT.
<DT>POLLWRBAND<DD>
Priority data may be written. 
</DL>
<P>

For STREAMS, data on priority bands greater than 0 may be written
without blocking. If any priority band has been written to on
this STREAM, this event only examines bands that have been written
to at least once. 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>POLLERR<DD>
An error has occurred on the device or stream. This flag is only valid
in the <I>revents</I> bitmask; it shall be ignored in
the <I>events</I> member.
<DT>POLLHUP<DD>
The device has been disconnected. This event and POLLOUT are mutually-exclusive;
a stream can never be writable if a hangup has
occurred. However, this event and POLLIN, POLLRDNORM, POLLRDBAND,
or POLLPRI are not mutually-exclusive. This flag is only valid in
the <I>revents</I> bitmask; it shall be ignored in the <I>events</I>
member.
<DT>POLLNVAL<DD>
The specified <I>fd</I> value is invalid. This flag is only valid in
the <I>revents</I> member; it shall ignored in the
<I>events</I> member.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The significance and semantics of normal, priority, and high-priority
data are file and device-specific.
<P>

If the value of <I>fd</I> is less than 0, <I>events</I> shall be ignored,
and <I>revents</I> shall be set to 0 in that entry on
return from <I>poll</I>().
<P>

In each <B>pollfd</B> structure, <I>poll</I>() shall clear the <I>revents</I>
member, except that where the application
requested a report on a condition by setting one of the bits of <I>events</I>
listed above, <I>poll</I>() shall set the
corresponding bit in <I>revents</I> if the requested condition is true.
In addition, <I>poll</I>() shall set the POLLHUP, POLLERR,
and POLLNVAL flag in <I>revents</I> if the condition is true, even
if the application did not set the corresponding bit in
<I>events</I>.
<P>

If none of the defined events have occurred on any selected file descriptor,
<I>poll</I>() shall wait at least <I>timeout</I>
milliseconds for an event to occur on any of the selected file descriptors.
If the value of <I>timeout</I> is 0, <I>poll</I>()
shall return immediately. If the value of <I>timeout</I> is -1, <I>poll</I>()
shall block until a requested event occurs or until
the call is interrupted.
<P>

Implementations may place limitations on the granularity of timeout
intervals. If the requested timeout interval requires a
finer granularity than the implementation supports, the actual timeout
interval shall be rounded up to the next supported
value.
<P>

The <I>poll</I>() function shall not be affected by the O_NONBLOCK
flag.
<P>

The <I>poll</I>() function shall support regular files, terminal and
pseudo-terminal devices, FIFOs, pipes, sockets and  
&nbsp;STREAMS-based files.  The behavior of <I>poll</I>() on
elements of <I>fds</I> that refer to other types of file is unspecified.
<P>

Regular files shall always poll TRUE for reading and writing.
<P>

A file descriptor for a socket that is listening for connections shall
indicate that it is ready for reading, once connections
are available. A file descriptor for a socket that is connecting asynchronously
shall indicate that it is ready for writing, once a
connection has been established.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, <I>poll</I>() shall return a non-negative
value. A positive value indicates the total number of file
descriptors that have been selected (that is, file descriptors for
which the <I>revents</I> member is non-zero). A value of 0
indicates that the call timed out and no file descriptors have been
selected. Upon failure, <I>poll</I>() shall return -1 and set
<I>errno</I> to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>poll</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The allocation of internal data structures failed but a subsequent
request may succeed.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
A signal was caught during <I>poll</I>().
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The <I>nfds</I> argument is greater than {OPEN_MAX},  or one of
the <I>fd</I> members refers to a STREAM or multiplexer
that is linked (directly or indirectly) downstream from a multiplexer.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Checking for Events on a Stream</H3>

<P>

The following example opens a pair of STREAMS devices and then waits
for either one to become writable. This example proceeds as
follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
Sets the <I>timeout</I> parameter to 500 milliseconds.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
Opens the STREAMS devices <B>/dev/dev0</B> and <B>/dev/dev1</B>, and
then polls them, specifying POLLOUT and POLLWRBAND as the
events of interest.
</DL>
<P>

The STREAMS device names <B>/dev/dev0</B> and <B>/dev/dev1</B> are only
examples of how STREAMS devices can be named; STREAMS
naming conventions may vary among systems conforming to the IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
Uses the <I>ret</I> variable to determine whether an event has occurred
on either of the two STREAMS. The <I>poll</I>() function
is given 500 milliseconds to wait for an event to occur (if it has
not occurred prior to the <I>poll</I>() call).
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 4.<DD>
Checks the returned value of <I>ret</I>. If a positive value is returned,
one of the following can be done:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> a.<DD>
Priority data can be written to the open STREAM on priority bands
greater than 0, because the POLLWRBAND event occurred on the
open STREAM ( <I>fds</I>[0] or <I>fds</I>[1]).
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> b.<DD>
Data can be written to the open STREAM on priority-band 0, because
the POLLOUT event occurred on the open STREAM ( <I>fds</I>[0]
or <I>fds</I>[1]).
</DL>
<P>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 5.<DD>
If the returned value is not a positive value, permission to write
data to the open STREAM (on any priority band) is denied.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 6.<DD>
If the POLLHUP event occurs on the open STREAM ( <I>fds</I>[0] or <I>fds</I>[1]),
the device on the open STREAM has
disconnected.
</DL>
