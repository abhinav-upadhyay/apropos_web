<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</I>() and <I>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</I>()
functions, respectively, shall get and set
the protocol attribute of a mutex attributes object pointed to by
<I>attr</I> which was previously created by the function <I>pthread_mutexattr_init</I>().
<P>

The <I>protocol</I> attribute defines the protocol to be followed in
utilizing mutexes. The value of <I>protocol</I> may be one
of:
<P>

<P>
PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE
<BR>

<P>
PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT
<BR>

<P>
<P>
PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT
<BR>

<P>
<P>

which are defined in the <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</A>&gt;</I> header.
<P>

When a thread owns a mutex with the PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE <I>protocol</I>
attribute, its priority and scheduling shall not be
affected by its mutex ownership.
<P>

When a thread is blocking higher priority threads because of owning
one or more mutexes with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT
<I>protocol</I> attribute, it shall execute at the higher of its priority
or the priority of the highest priority thread waiting on
any of the mutexes owned by this thread and initialized with this
protocol. 
<P>

When a thread owns one or more mutexes initialized with the PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT
protocol, it shall execute at the higher of its
priority or the highest of the priority ceilings of all the mutexes
owned by this thread and initialized with this attribute,
regardless of whether other threads are blocked on any of these mutexes
or not. 
<P>

While a thread is holding a mutex which has been initialized with
the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol
attributes, it shall not be subject to being moved to the tail of
the scheduling queue at its priority in the event that its
original priority is changed, such as by a call to <I>sched_setparam</I>().
Likewise, when a thread unlocks a mutex that has been initialized
with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol
attributes, it shall not be subject to being moved to the tail of
the scheduling queue at its priority in the event that its
original priority is changed.
<P>

If a thread simultaneously owns several mutexes initialized with different
protocols, it shall execute at the highest of the
priorities that it would have obtained by each of these protocols.
<P>

When a thread makes a call to <I>pthread_mutex_lock</I>(), the mutex
was
initialized with the protocol attribute having the value PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT,
when the calling thread is blocked because the mutex
is owned by another thread, that owner thread shall inherit the priority
level of the calling thread as long as it continues to own
the mutex. The implementation shall update its execution priority
to the maximum of its assigned priority and all its inherited
priorities. Furthermore, if this owner thread itself becomes blocked
on another mutex, the same priority inheritance effect shall
be propagated to this other owner thread, in a recursive manner. 
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, the <I>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</I>()
and <I>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</I>() functions
shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ENOTSUP</B>

<DD>
The value specified by <I>protocol</I> is an unsupported value.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</I>() and <I>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</I>()
functions may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value specified by <I>attr</I> or <I>protocol</I> is invalid.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The caller does not have the privilege to perform the operation.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
