The storage occupied by <i>sa_handler</i> and <i>sa_sigaction</i> may overlap, and a conforming application shall not use both simultaneously.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the argument <i>act</i> is not a null pointer, it points to a structure specifying the action to be associated with the specified signal. If the argument  <i>oact</i> is not a null pointer, the action previously associated with the signal is stored in the location pointed to by the argument  <i>oact</i>. If the argument  <i>act</i> is a null pointer, signal handling is unchanged; thus, the call can be used to enquire about the current handling of a given signal. The SIGKILL and SIGSTOP signals shall not be added to the signal mask using this mechanism; this restriction shall be enforced by the system without causing an error to be indicated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the SA_SIGINFO flag (see below) is cleared in the <i>sa_flags</i> field of the  <b>sigaction</b> structure, the  <i>sa_handler</i> field identifies the action to be associated with the specified signal.  If the SA_SIGINFO flag is set in the  <i>sa_flags</i> field, and the implementation supports the Realtime Signals Extension option or the XSI Extension option, the  <i>sa_sigaction</i> field specifies a signal-catching function.  If the SA_SIGINFO bit is cleared and the  <i>sa_handler</i> field specifies a signal-catching function, or if the SA_SIGINFO bit is set, the  <i>sa_mask</i> field identifies a set of signals that shall be added to the signal mask of the thread before the signal-catching function is invoked. If the  <i>sa_handler</i> field specifies a signal-catching function, the  <i>sa_mask</i> field identifies a set of signals that shall be added to the process' signal mask before the signal-catching function is invoked.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>sa_flags</i> field can be used to modify the behavior of the specified signal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following flags, defined in the <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i> header, can be set in  <i>sa_flags</i>:<dl>

When a signal is caught by a signal-catching function installed by  <i>sigaction</i>(), a new signal mask is calculated and installed for the duration of the signal-catching function (or until a call to either  <i>sigprocmask</i>() or <i>sigsuspend</i>() is made). This mask is formed by taking the union of the current signal mask and the value of the  <i>sa_mask</i> for the signal being delivered  unless SA_NODEFER or SA_RESETHAND is set,  and then including the signal being delivered. If and when the user's signal handler returns normally, the original signal mask is restored.<div class="spacer">

Once an action is installed for a specific signal, it shall remain installed until another action is explicitly requested (by another call to  <i>sigaction</i>()),  until the SA_RESETHAND flag causes resetting of the handler, or until one of the  <i>exec</i> functions is called.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the previous action for <i>sig</i> had been established by <i>signal</i>(), the values of the fields returned in the structure pointed to by  <i>oact</i> are unspecified, and in particular  <i>oact</i>-&gt;  <i>sa_handler</i> is not necessarily the same value passed to <i>signal</i>(). However, if a pointer to the same structure or a copy thereof is passed to a subsequent call to  <i>sigaction</i>() via the <i>act</i> argument, handling of the signal shall be as if the original call to  <i>signal</i>() were repeated.<div class="spacer">

If <i>sigaction</i>() fails, no new signal handler is installed.<div class="spacer">

It is unspecified whether an attempt to set the action for a signal that cannot be caught or ignored to SIG_DFL is ignored or causes an error to be returned with  <i>errno</i> set to [EINVAL].<div class="spacer">

<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> The  <i>sigaction</i>() function supersedes the <i>signal</i>() function, and should be used in preference. In particular,  <i>sigaction</i>() and <i>signal</i>() should not be used in the same process to control the same signal. The behavior of reentrant functions, as defined in the DESCRIPTION, is as specified by this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, regardless of invocation from a signal-catching function. This is the only intended meaning of the statement that reentrant functions may be used in signal-catching functions without restrictions. Applications must still consider all effects of such functions on such things as data structures, files, and process state. In particular, application writers need to consider the restrictions on interactions when interrupting  <i>sleep</i>() and interactions among multiple handles for a file description. The fact that any specific function is listed as reentrant does not necessarily mean that invocation of that function from a signal-catching function is recommended.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In order to prevent errors arising from interrupting non-reentrant function calls, applications should protect calls to these functions either by blocking the appropriate signals or through the use of some programmatic semaphore (see  <i>semget</i>(), <i>sem_init</i>(),  <i>sem_open</i>(), and so on). Note in particular that even the &quot;safe&quot; functions may modify  <i>errno</i>; the signal-catching function, if not executing as an independent thread, may want to save and restore its value. Naturally, the same principles apply to the reentrancy of application routines and asynchronous data access. Note that  <i>longjmp</i>() and  <i>siglongjmp</i>() are not in the list of reentrant functions. This is because the code executing after  <i>longjmp</i>() and <i>siglongjmp</i>() can call any unsafe functions with the same danger as calling those unsafe functions directly from the signal handler. Applications that use  <i>longjmp</i>() and <i>siglongjmp</i>() from within signal handlers require rigorous protection in order to be portable. Many of the other functions that are excluded from the list are traditionally implemented using either  <i>malloc</i>() or <i>free</i>() functions or the standard I/O library, both of which traditionally use data structures in a non-reentrant manner. Since any combination of different functions using a common data structure can cause reentrancy problems, this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 does not define the behavior when any unsafe function is called in a signal handler that interrupts an unsafe function.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling <i>abort</i>(),  <i>kill</i>(), or <i>raise</i>(), the behavior is undefined if the signal handler calls any function in the standard library other than one of the functions listed in the table above or refers to any object with static storage duration other than by assigning a value to a static storage duration variable of type  <b>volatile sig_atomic_t</b>. Furthermore, if such a call fails, the value of  <i>errno</i> is unspecified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Usually, the signal is executed on the stack that was in effect before the signal was delivered. An alternate stack may be specified to receive a subset of the signals being caught.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the signal handler returns, the receiving process resumes execution at the point it was interrupted unless the signal handler makes other arrangements. If  <i>longjmp</i>() or <i>_longjmp</i>() is used to leave the signal handler, then the signal mask must be explicitly restored by the process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 defines the third argument of a signal handling function when SA_SIGINFO is set as a  <b>void *</b> instead of a <b>ucontext_t *</b>, but without requiring type checking. New applications should explicitly cast the third argument of the signal handling function to  <b>ucontext_t *</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The BSD optional four argument signal handling function is not supported by this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001. The BSD declaration would be:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>void handler(int</b> <i>sig</i><b>, int</b> <i>code</i><b>, struct sigcontext *</b><i>scp</i><b>,</b><br/>
<b>    char *</b><i>addr</i><b>);</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
where <i>sig</i> is the signal number, <i>code</i> is additional information on certain signals,  <i>scp</i> is a pointer to the  <b>sigcontext</b> structure, and <i>addr</i> is additional address information. Much the same information is available in the objects pointed to by the second argument of the signal handler specified when SA_SIGINFO is set.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> Although this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 requires that signals that cannot be ignored shall not be added to the signal mask when a signal-catching function is entered, there is no explicit requirement that subsequent calls to  <i>sigaction</i>() reflect this in the information returned in the  <i>oact</i> argument. In other words, if SIGKILL is included in the  <i>sa_mask</i> field of <i>act</i>, it is unspecified whether or not a subsequent call to  <i>sigaction</i>() returns with SIGKILL included in the  <i>sa_mask</i> field of <i>oact</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The SA_NOCLDSTOP flag, when supplied in the <i>act</i>-&gt; <i>sa_flags</i> parameter, allows overloading SIGCHLD with the System V semantics that each SIGCLD signal indicates a single terminated child. Most conforming applications that catch SIGCHLD are expected to install signal-catching functions that repeatedly call the  <i>waitpid</i>() function with the WNOHANG flag set, acting on each child for which status is returned, until  <i>waitpid</i>() returns zero. If stopped children are not of interest, the use of the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag can prevent the overhead from invoking the signal-catching routine when they stop.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some historical implementations also define other mechanisms for stopping processes, such as the  <i>ptrace</i>() function. These implementations usually do not generate a SIGCHLD signal when processes stop due to this mechanism; however, that is beyond the scope of this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 requires that calls to <i>sigaction</i>() that supply a NULL  <i>act</i> argument succeed, even in the case of signals that cannot be caught or ignored (that is, SIGKILL or SIGSTOP). The System V  <i>signal</i>() and BSD  <i>sigvec</i>() functions return [EINVAL] in these cases and, in this respect, their behavior varies from  <i>sigaction</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 requires that <i>sigaction</i>() properly save and restore a signal action set up by the ISO&#160;C standard  <i>signal</i>() function. However, there is no guarantee that the reverse is true, nor could there be given the greater amount of information conveyed by the  <b>sigaction</b> structure. Because of this, applications should avoid using both functions for the same signal in the same process. Since this cannot always be avoided in case of general-purpose library routines, they should always be implemented with  <i>sigaction</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
It was intended that the <i>signal</i>() function should be implementable as a library routine using  <i>sigaction</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The POSIX Realtime Extension extends the <i>sigaction</i>() function as specified by the POSIX.1-1990 standard to allow the application to request on a per-signal basis via an additional signal action flag that the extra parameters, including the application-defined signal value, if any, be passed to the signal-catching function.</div>
