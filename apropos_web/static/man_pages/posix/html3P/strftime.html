<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>strftime</I>() function shall place bytes into the array pointed
to by <I>s</I> as controlled by the string pointed to by
<I>format</I>. The format is a character string, beginning and ending
in its initial shift state, if any. The <I>format</I> string
consists of zero or more conversion specifications and ordinary characters.
A conversion specification consists of a <B>'%'</B>
character, possibly followed by an <B>E</B> or <B>O</B> modifier, and
a terminating conversion specifier character that
determines the conversion specification's behavior. All ordinary characters
(including the terminating null byte) are copied
unchanged into the array. If copying takes place between objects that
overlap, the behavior is undefined. No more than
<I>maxsize</I> bytes are placed into the array. Each conversion specifier
is replaced by appropriate characters as described in the
following list. The appropriate characters are determined using the
<I>LC_TIME</I> category of the current locale and by the values
of zero or more members of the broken-down time structure pointed
to by <I>timeptr</I>, as specified in brackets in the
description. If any of the specified values are outside the normal
range, the characters stored are unspecified.
<P>

Local timezone information is used as though <I>strftime</I>() called
<I>tzset</I>(). 
<P>

characters if no timezone is determinable. For example, <B>&quot;-0430&quot;</B>
means 4 hours 30 minutes behind UTC (west of Greenwich).
&nbsp;If <I>tm_isdst</I> is zero, the standard time offset is used. If
<I>tm_isdst</I> is greater than zero, the daylight savings
time offset is used. If <I>tm_isdst</I> is negative, no characters

timezone information exists. [ <I>tm_isdst</I>]

<P>
</DL>
<P>

If a conversion specification does not correspond to any of the above,
the behavior is undefined.
<P>

If
a <B>struct tm</B> broken-down time structure is created by <I>localtime</I>()
or <I>localtime_r</I>(), or modified by <I>mktime</I>(), and the value
of <I>TZ</I> is subsequently modified, the results of the <B>%Z</B>
and <B>%z</B> <I>strftime</I>() conversion specifiers are undefined,
when <I>strftime</I>() is called with such a broken-down
time structure.
<P>

If a <B>struct tm</B> broken-down time structure is created or modified
by <I>gmtime</I>() or <I>gmtime_r</I>(), it is unspecified
whether the result of the <B>%Z</B> and <B>%z</B> conversion specifiers
shall refer to UTC or the current local timezone, when
<I>strftime</I>() is called with such a broken-down time structure.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Modified Conversion Specifiers</H3>

<P>

Some conversion specifiers can be modified by the <B>E</B> or <B>O</B>
modifier characters to indicate that an alternative
format or specification should be used rather than the one normally
used by the unmodified conversion specifier. If the alternative
format or specification does not exist for the current locale (see
ERA in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 7.3.5, LC_TIME), the behavior shall
be as if the unmodified conversion specification were used.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>%Ec</B><DD>
Replaced by the locale's alternative appropriate date and time representation.
<DT><B>%EC</B><DD>
Replaced by the name of the base year (period) in the locale's alternative
representation.

<DT><B>%EX</B><DD>

Replaced by the full alternative year representation.
<DT><B>%Od</B><DD>

symbols, filled as needed with leading zeros if there
is any alternative symbol for zero; otherwise, with leading spaces.
<DT><B>%Oe</B><DD>
Replaced by the day of the month, using the locale's alternative numeric
symbols, filled as needed with leading spaces.
<DT><B>%OH</B><DD>
Replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) using the locale's alternative
numeric symbols.
<DT><B>%OI</B><DD>
Replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) using the locale's alternative
numeric symbols.
<DT><B>%Om</B><DD>
Replaced by the month using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.
<DT><B>%OM</B><DD>
Replaced by the minutes using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.
<DT><B>%OS</B><DD>
Replaced by the seconds using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.
<DT><B>%Ou</B><DD>
Replaced by the weekday as a number in the locale's alternative representation
(Monday=1).
<DT><B>%OU</B><DD>
Replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of
the week, rules corresponding to <B>%U</B> ) using the
locale's alternative numeric symbols.
<DT><B>%OV</B><DD>
Replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of
the week, rules corresponding to <B>%V</B> ) using the
locale's alternative numeric symbols.
<DT><B>%Ow</B><DD>
Replaced by the number of the weekday (Sunday=0) using the locale's
alternative numeric symbols.
<DT><B>%OW</B><DD>
Replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of
the week) using the locale's alternative numeric
symbols.
<DT><B>%Oy</B><DD>
Replaced by the year (offset from <B>%C</B> ) using the locale's alternative
numeric symbols.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

<B>%g</B>, <B>%G</B>, and <B>%V</B> give values according to the ISO&nbsp;8601:2000
standard week-based year. In this
system, weeks begin on a Monday and week 1 of the year is the week
that includes January 4th, which is also the week that includes
the first Thursday of the year, and is also the first week that contains
at least four days in the year. If the first Monday of
January is the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th, the preceding days are part of the
last week of the preceding year; thus, for Saturday 2nd January
1999, <B>%G</B> is replaced by 1998 and <B>%V</B> is replaced by 53.
If December 29th, 30th, or 31st is a Monday, it and any
following days are part of week 1 of the following year. Thus, for
Tuesday 30th December 1997, <B>%G</B> is replaced by 1998 and
<B>%V</B> is replaced by 01.
<P>

If a conversion specifier is not one of the above, the behavior is
undefined.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

If the total number of resulting bytes including the terminating null
byte is not more than <I>maxsize</I>, <I>strftime</I>()
shall return the number of bytes placed into the array pointed to
by <I>s</I>, not including the terminating null byte. Otherwise,
0 shall be returned and the contents of the array are unspecified.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

No errors are defined.

<H3>Getting a Localized Date String</H3>

<P>

The following example first sets the locale to the user's default.
The locale information will be used in the <I>nl_langinfo</I>() and
<I>strftime</I>() functions. The <I>nl_langinfo</I>() function returns
the localized date string which specifies how the date is
laid out. The <I>strftime</I>() function takes this information and,
using the <B>tm</B> structure for values, places the date and
time information into <I>datestring</I>.

<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

The range of values for <B>%S</B> is [00,60] rather than [00,59] to
allow for the occasional leap second.
<P>

Some of the conversion specifications are duplicates of others. They
are included for compatibility with <I>nl_cxtime</I>() and
<I>nl_ascxtime</I>(), which were published in Issue 2.
<P>

Applications should use <B>%Y</B> (4-digit years) in preference to
<B>%y</B> (2-digit years).
<P>

In the C locale, the <B>E</B> and <B>O</B> modifiers are ignored and
the replacement strings for the following specifiers
are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>%a</B><DD>
The first three characters of <B>%A</B> .
<DT><B>%A</B><DD>
One of Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday.
<DT><B>%b</B><DD>
The first three characters of <B>%B</B> .
<DT><B>%B</B><DD>
One of January, February, ..., December.
<DT><B>%c</B><DD>
Equivalent to <B>%a</B> <B>%b</B> <B>%e</B> <B>%T</B> <B>%Y</B> .
