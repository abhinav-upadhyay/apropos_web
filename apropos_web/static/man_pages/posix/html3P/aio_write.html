aio_write - asynchronous write to a file (<B>REALTIME</B>)

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>aio_write</I>() function shall write <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_nbytes</I>
to the file associated with
<I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_fildes</I> from the buffer pointed to by <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_buf</I>.
The function shall return when
the write request has been initiated or, at a minimum, queued to the
file or device.
<P>

If prioritized I/O is supported for this file, then the asynchronous
operation shall be submitted at a priority equal to the
scheduling priority of the process minus <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_reqprio</I>.
<P>

The <I>aiocbp</I> argument may be used as an argument to <I>aio_error</I>()
and <I>aio_return</I>() in order to determine the error status and
return status, respectively,
of the asynchronous operation while it is proceeding.
<P>

The <I>aiocbp</I> argument points to an <B>aiocb</B> structure. If the
buffer pointed to by <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_buf</I> or
the control block pointed to by <I>aiocbp</I> becomes an illegal address
prior to asynchronous I/O completion, then the behavior is
undefined.
<P>

If O_APPEND is not set for the file descriptor <I>aio_fildes</I>, then
the requested operation shall take place at the absolute
position in the file as given by <I>aio_offset</I>, as if <I>lseek</I>()
were called
immediately prior to the operation with an <I>offset</I> equal to <I>aio_offset</I>
and a <I>whence</I> equal to SEEK_SET. If
O_APPEND is set for the file descriptor, write operations append to
the file in the same order as the calls were made. After a
successful call to enqueue an asynchronous I/O operation, the value
of the file offset for the file is unspecified.
<P>

The <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_lio_opcode</I> field shall be ignored by <I>aio_write</I>().
<P>

Simultaneous asynchronous operations using the same <I>aiocbp</I> produce
undefined results.
<P>

If synchronized I/O is enabled on the file associated with <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_fildes</I>,
the behavior of this function shall
be according to the definitions of synchronized I/O data integrity
completion, and synchronized I/O file integrity completion. 
<P>

For any system action that changes the process memory space while
an asynchronous I/O is outstanding to the address range being
changed, the result of that action is undefined.
<P>

For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset maximum
established in the open file description associated with
<I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_fildes</I>.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

The <I>aio_write</I>() function shall return the value zero to the
calling process if the I/O operation is successfully queued;
otherwise, the function shall return the value -1 and set <I>errno</I>
to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>aio_write</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The requested asynchronous I/O operation was not queued due to system
resource limitations.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

Each of the following conditions may be detected synchronously at
the time of the call to <I>aio_write</I>(), or asynchronously.
If any of the conditions below are detected synchronously, the <I>aio_write</I>()
function shall return -1 and set <I>errno</I> to
the corresponding value. If any of the conditions below are detected
asynchronously, the return status of the asynchronous
operation shall be set to -1, and the error status of the asynchronous
operation is set to the corresponding value.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_fildes</I> argument is not a valid file descriptor
open for writing.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The file offset value implied by <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_offset</I> would
be invalid, <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_reqprio</I> is
not a valid value, or <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_nbytes</I> is an invalid
value.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

In the case that the <I>aio_write</I>() successfully queues the I/O
operation, the return status of the asynchronous operation
shall be one of the values normally returned by the <I>write</I>()
function call. If the
operation is successfully queued but is subsequently canceled or encounters
an error, the error status for the asynchronous
operation contains one of the values normally set by the <I>write</I>()
function call, or one
of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_fildes</I> argument is not a valid file descriptor
open for writing.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The file offset value implied by <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_offset</I> would
be invalid.
<DT><B>ECANCELED</B>

<DD>
The requested I/O was canceled before the I/O completed due to an
explicit <I>aio_cancel</I>() request.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The following condition may be detected synchronously or asynchronously:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EFBIG</B>

<DD>
The file is a regular file, <I>aiobcp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_nbytes</I> is greater
than 0, and the starting offset in
<I>aiobcp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_offset</I> is at or beyond the offset maximum
in the open file description associated with
<I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_fildes</I>.
