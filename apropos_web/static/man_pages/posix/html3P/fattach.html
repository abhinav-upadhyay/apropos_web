<h1>NAME</h1> fattach - attach a STREAMS-based file descriptor to a file in the file system name space ( <b>STREAMS</b>)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>  <b>#include &lt;stropts.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>fattach</i>() function shall attach a STREAMS-based file descriptor to a file, effectively associating a pathname with  <i>fildes</i>. The application shall ensure that the <i>fildes</i> argument is a valid open file descriptor associated with a STREAMS file. The  <i>path</i> argument points to a pathname of an existing file. The application shall have the appropriate privileges or be the owner of the file named by  <i>path</i> and have write permission. A successful call to  <i>fattach</i>() shall cause all pathnames that name the file named by  <i>path</i> to name the STREAMS file associated with  <i>fildes</i>, until the STREAMS file is detached from the file. A STREAMS file can be attached to more than one file and can have several pathnames associated with it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The attributes of the named STREAMS file shall be initialized as follows: the permissions, user ID, group ID, and times are set to those of the file named by  <i>path</i>, the number of links is set to 1, and the size and device identifier are set to those of the STREAMS file associated with  <i>fildes</i>. If any attributes of the named STREAMS file are subsequently changed (for example, by  <i>chmod</i>()), neither the attributes of the underlying file nor the attributes of the STREAMS file to which  <i>fildes</i> refers shall be affected.<div class="spacer">
</div>
File descriptors referring to the underlying file, opened prior to an  <i>fattach</i>() call, shall continue to refer to the underlying file.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion,  <i>fattach</i>() shall return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and  <i>errno</i> set to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>fattach</i>() function shall fail if:<dl>

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Attaching a File Descriptor to a File</h2> In the following example,  <i>fd</i> refers to an open STREAMS file. The call to  <i>fattach</i>() associates this STREAM with the file  <b>/tmp/named-STREAM</b>, such that any future calls to open <b>/tmp/named-STREAM</b>, prior to breaking the attachment via a call to  <i>fdetach</i>(), will instead create a new file handle referring to the STREAMS file associated with  <i>fd</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> The  <i>fattach</i>() function behaves similarly to the traditional  <i>mount</i>() function in the way a file is temporarily replaced by the root directory of the mounted file system. In the case of  <i>fattach</i>(), the replaced file need not be a directory and the replacing file is a STREAMS file.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> The file attributes of a file which has been the subject of an  <i>fattach</i>() call are specifically set because of an artefact of the original implementation. The internal mechanism was the same as for the  <i>mount</i>() function. Since <i>mount</i>() is typically only applied to directories, the effects when applied to a regular file are a little surprising, especially as regards the link count which rigidly remains one, even if there were several links originally and despite the fact that all original links refer to the STREAM as long as the  <i>fattach</i>() remains in effect.</div>
