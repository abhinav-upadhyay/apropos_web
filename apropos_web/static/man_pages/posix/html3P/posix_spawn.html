<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>() functions shall create
a new process (child process) from the specified
process image. The new process image shall be constructed from a regular
executable file called the new process image file.
<P>

When a C program is executed as the result of this call, it shall
be entered as a C-language function call as follows:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>int main(int</B> <I>argc</I><B>, char *</B><I>argv</I><B>[]);
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

where <I>argc</I> is the argument count and <I>argv</I> is an array
of character pointers to the arguments themselves. In
addition, the following variable:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>extern char **environ;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

shall be initialized as a pointer to an array of character pointers
to the environment strings.
<P>

The argument <I>argv</I> is an array of character pointers to null-terminated
strings. The last member of this array shall be a
null pointer and is not counted in <I>argc</I>. These strings constitute
the argument list available to the new process image. The
value in <I>argv</I>[0] should point to a filename that is associated
with the process image being started by the
<I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>() function.
<P>

The argument <I>envp</I> is an array of character pointers to null-terminated
strings. These strings constitute the environment
for the new process image. The environment array is terminated by
a null pointer.
<P>

The number of bytes available for the child process' combined argument
and environment lists is {ARG_MAX}. The implementation
shall specify in the system documentation (see the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Chapter 2, Conformance) whether
any list overhead, such as length words, null terminators,
pointers, or alignment bytes, is included in this total.
<P>

The <I>path</I> argument to <I>posix_spawn</I>() is a pathname that
identifies the new process image file to execute.
<P>

The <I>file</I> parameter to <I>posix_spawnp</I>() shall be used to
construct a pathname that identifies the new process image
file. If the <I>file</I> parameter contains a slash character, the
<I>file</I> parameter shall be used as the pathname for the new
process image file. Otherwise, the path prefix for this file shall
be obtained by a search of the directories passed as the
environment variable <I>PATH</I> (see the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables). If this
environment variable is not defined, the results of
the search are implementation-defined.
<P>

If <I>file_actions</I> is a null pointer, then file descriptors open
in the calling process shall remain open in the child
process, except for those whose close-on- <I>exec</I> flag FD_CLOEXEC
is set (see <I>fcntl</I>()). For those file descriptors that remain
open, all attributes of the corresponding open file
descriptions, including file locks (see <I>fcntl</I>()), shall remain
unchanged.
<P>

If <I>file_actions</I> is not NULL, then the file descriptors open
in the child process shall be those open in the calling
process as modified by the spawn file actions object pointed to by
<I>file_actions</I> and the FD_CLOEXEC flag of each remaining
open file descriptor after the spawn file actions have been processed.
The effective order of processing the spawn file actions
shall be:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
The set of open file descriptors for the child process shall initially
be the same set as is open for the calling process. All
attributes of the corresponding open file descriptions, including
file locks (see <I>fcntl</I>()), shall
remain unchanged.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
The signal mask, signal default actions, and the effective user and
group IDs for the child process shall be changed as
specified in the attributes object referenced by <I>attrp</I>.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
The file actions specified by the spawn file actions object shall
be performed in the order in which they were added to the
spawn file actions object.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 4.<DD>
Any file descriptor that has its FD_CLOEXEC flag set (see <I>fcntl</I>()
) shall be closed.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The <B>posix_spawnattr_t</B> spawn attributes object type is defined
in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/spawn.h">spawn.h</A>&gt;</I>. It shall contain at least the attributes defined
below.
<P>

If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the <I>spawn-flags</I>
attribute of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>, and the
<I>spawn-pgroup</I> attribute of the same object is non-zero, then
the child's process group shall be as specified in the
<I>spawn-pgroup</I> attribute of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>.
<P>

As a special case, if the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the
<I>spawn-flags</I> attribute of the object referenced by
<I>attrp</I>, and the <I>spawn-pgroup</I> attribute of the same object
is set to zero, then the child shall be in a new process
group with a process group ID equal to its process ID.
<P>

If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is not set in the <I>spawn-flags</I>
attribute of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>, the
new child process shall inherit the parent's process group.
<P>

If
the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag is set in the <I>spawn-flags</I>
attribute of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>, but
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is not set, the new process image shall initially
have the scheduling policy of the calling process with
the scheduling parameters specified in the <I>spawn-schedparam</I>
attribute of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>.
<P>

If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER flag is set in the <I>spawn-flags</I>
attribute of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>
(regardless of the setting of the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag),
the new process image shall initially have the scheduling policy
specified in the <I>spawn-schedpolicy</I> attribute of the object referenced
by <I>attrp</I> and the scheduling parameters
specified in the <I>spawn-schedparam</I> attribute of the same object.
<P>

The POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the <I>spawn-flags</I> attribute of
the object referenced by <I>attrp</I> governs the effective
user ID of the child process. If this flag is not set, the child process
shall inherit the parent process' effective user ID. If
this flag is set, the child process' effective user ID shall be reset
to the parent's real user ID. In either case, if the
set-user-ID mode bit of the new process image file is set, the effective
user ID of the child process shall become that file's
owner ID before the new process image begins execution.
<P>

The POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the <I>spawn-flags</I> attribute of
the object referenced by <I>attrp</I> also governs the
effective group ID of the child process. If this flag is not set,
the child process shall inherit the parent process' effective
group ID. If this flag is set, the child process' effective group
ID shall be reset to the parent's real group ID. In either case,
if the set-group-ID mode bit of the new process image file is set,
the effective group ID of the child process shall become that
file's group ID before the new process image begins execution.
<P>

If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK flag is set in the <I>spawn-flags</I>
attribute of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>, the
child process shall initially have the signal mask specified in the
<I>spawn-sigmask</I> attribute of the object referenced by
<I>attrp</I>.
<P>

If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag is set in the <I>spawn-flags</I>
attribute of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>, the
signals specified in the <I>spawn-sigdefault</I> attribute of the same
object shall be set to their default actions in the child
process. Signals set to the default action in the parent process shall
be set to the default action in the child process.
<P>

Signals set to be caught by the calling process shall be set to the
default action in the child process.
<P>

Except for SIGCHLD, signals set to be ignored by the calling process
image shall be set to be ignored by the child process,
unless otherwise specified by the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being
set in the <I>spawn-flags</I> attribute of the object referenced
by <I>attrp</I> and the signals being indicated in the <I>spawn-sigdefault</I>
attribute of the object referenced by
<I>attrp</I>.
<P>

If the SIGCHLD signal is set to be ignored by the calling process,
it is unspecified whether the SIGCHLD signal is set to be
ignored or to the default action in the child process, unless otherwise
specified by the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being set in
the <I>spawn_flags</I> attribute of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>
and the SIGCHLD signal being indicated in the
<I>spawn_sigdefault</I> attribute of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>.
<P>

If the value of the <I>attrp</I> pointer is NULL, then the default
values are used.
<P>

All process attributes, other than those influenced by the attributes
set in the object referenced by <I>attrp</I> as specified
above or by the file descriptor manipulations specified in <I>file_actions</I>,
shall appear in the new process image as though <I>fork</I>() had been
called to create a child process and then a member of the <I>exec</I>
family of functions had been called by the child process to execute
the new process
image.
<P>

It is implementation-defined whether the fork handlers are run when
<I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>() is called. 
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
shall return the process ID of the child process to
the parent process, in the variable pointed to by a non-NULL <I>pid</I>
argument, and shall return zero as the function return
value. Otherwise, no child process shall be created, the value stored
into the variable pointed to by a non-NULL <I>pid</I> is
unspecified, and an error number shall be returned as the function
return value to indicate the error. If the <I>pid</I> argument
is a null pointer, the process ID of the child is not returned to
the caller.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>() functions may fail
if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value specified by <I>file_actions</I> or <I>attrp</I> is invalid.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

If this error occurs after the calling process successfully returns
from the <I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
function, the child process may exit with exit status 127.
<P>

If <I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>() fail for any of the
reasons that would cause <I>fork</I>() or one of the <I>exec</I> family
of functions to
fail, an error value shall be returned as described by <I>fork</I>()
and <I>exec</I>, respectively (or, if the error occurs after the calling
process successfully returns, the
child process shall exit with exit status 127).
<P>

If POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP is set in the <I>spawn-flags</I> attribute
of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>, and
<I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>() fails while changing the
child's process group, an error value shall be returned as
described by <I>setpgid</I>() (or, if the error occurs after the calling
process
successfully returns, the child process shall exit with exit status
127).
<P>

If
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM is set and POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is not
set in the <I>spawn-flags</I> attribute of the object
referenced by <I>attrp</I>, then if <I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
fails for any of the reasons that would cause <I>sched_setparam</I>()
to fail, an error value shall be returned as described by <I>sched_setparam</I>()
(or, if the error occurs after the calling process successfully
returns, the child process shall exit with exit status 127).
<P>

If POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is set in the <I>spawn-flags</I> attribute
of the object referenced by <I>attrp</I>, and if
<I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>() fails for any of the reasons
that would cause <I>sched_setscheduler</I>() to fail, an error value
shall be returned as described by <I>sched_setscheduler</I>() (or,
if the error occurs after the calling process
successfully returns, the child process shall exit with exit status
127). 
<P>

If the <I>file_actions</I> argument is not NULL, and specifies any
<I>close</I>, <I>dup2</I>, or <I>open</I> actions to be
performed, and if <I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>() fails
for any of the reasons that would cause <I>close</I>(), <I>dup2</I>(),
or <I>open</I>() to fail, an error value shall be returned as described
by <I>close</I>(), <I>dup2</I>(), and <I>open</I>(), respectively (or,
if the error occurs after the calling process successfully returns,
the child process shall exit with exit status 127). An open file action
may, by itself, result in any of the errors described by <I>close</I>()
or <I>dup2</I>(), in addition to those
described by <I>open</I>().
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

These functions are part of the Spawn option and need not be provided
on all implementations.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

The <I>posix_spawn</I>() function and its close relation <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
have been introduced to overcome the following
perceived difficulties with <I>fork</I>(): the <I>fork</I>() function
is difficult or impossible to implement without swapping or dynamic
address
translation.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Swapping is generally too slow for a realtime environment.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Dynamic address translation is not available everywhere that POSIX
might be useful.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Processes are too useful to simply option out of POSIX whenever it
must run without address translation or other MMU
services.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Thus, POSIX needs process creation and file execution primitives that
can be efficiently implemented without address translation
or other MMU services.
<P>

The <I>posix_spawn</I>() function is implementable as a library routine,
but both <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
are designed as kernel operations. Also, although they may be an efficient
replacement for many <I>fork</I>()/ <I>exec</I> pairs, their goal is
to provide useful
process creation primitives for systems that have difficulty with
<I>fork</I>(), not to
provide drop-in replacements for <I>fork</I>()/ <I>exec</I>.
<P>

This view of the role of <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
influenced the design of their API. It does not attempt
to provide the full functionality of <I>fork</I>()/ <I>exec</I> in which
arbitrary user-specified operations of any sort are permitted between
the creation
of the child process and the execution of the new process image; any
attempt to reach that level would need to provide a
programming language as parameters. Instead, <I>posix_spawn</I>() and
<I>posix_spawnp</I>() are process creation primitives like
the <I>Start_Process</I> and <I>Start_Process_Search</I> Ada language
bindings package <I>POSIX_Process_Primitives</I> and also
like those in many operating systems that are not UNIX systems, but
with some POSIX-specific additions.
<P>

To achieve its coverage goals, <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
have control of six types of inheritance: file
descriptors, process group ID, user and group ID, signal mask, scheduling,
and whether each signal ignored in the parent will
remain ignored in the child, or be reset to its default action in
the child.
<P>

Control of file descriptors is required to allow an independently
written child process image to access data streams opened by
and even generated or read by the parent process without being specifically
coded to know which parent files and file descriptors
are to be used. Control of the process group ID is required to control
how the child process' job control relates to that of the
parent.
<P>

Control of the signal mask and signal defaulting is sufficient to
support the implementation of <I>system</I>(). Although support for
<I>system</I>() is not
explicitly one of the goals for <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>(),
it is covered under the &quot;at least 50%&quot; coverage
goal.
<P>

The intention is that the normal file descriptor inheritance across
<I>fork</I>(), the
subsequent effect of the specified spawn file actions, and the normal
file descriptor inheritance across one of the <I>exec</I> family of
functions should fully specify open file inheritance. The implementation
need make
no decisions regarding the set of open file descriptors when the child
process image begins execution, those decisions having
already been made by the caller and expressed as the set of open file
descriptors and their FD_CLOEXEC flags at the time of the
call and the spawn file actions object specified in the call. We have
been assured that in cases where the POSIX
<I>Start_Process</I> Ada primitives have been implemented in a library,
this method of controlling file descriptor inheritance may
be implemented very easily.
<P>

We can identify several problems with <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>(),
but there does not appear to be a solution
that introduces fewer problems. Environment modification for child
process attributes not specifiable via the <I>attrp</I> or
<I>file_actions</I> arguments must be done in the parent process, and
since the parent generally wants to save its context, it is
more costly than similar functionality with <I>fork</I>()/ <I>exec</I>.
It is also complicated to modify the environment of a multi-threaded
process temporarily,
since all threads must agree when it is safe for the environment to
be changed. However, this cost is only borne by those
invocations of <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>() that use
the additional functionality. Since extensive modifications
are not the usual case, and are particularly unlikely in time-critical
code, keeping much of the environment control out of
<I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>() is appropriate design.
<P>

The <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>() functions do not
have all the power of <I>fork</I>()/ <I>exec</I>. This is to be expected.
The <I>fork</I>() function is a wonderfully powerful operation. We
do not expect to duplicate its
functionality in a simple, fast function with no special hardware
requirements. It is worth noting that <I>posix_spawn</I>() and
<I>posix_spawnp</I>() are very similar to the process creation operations
on many operating systems that are not UNIX systems.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Requirements</H3>

<P>

The requirements for <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
They must be implementable without an MMU or unusual hardware.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
They must be compatible with existing POSIX standards.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Additional goals are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
They should be efficiently implementable.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
They should be able to replace at least 50% of typical executions
of <I>fork</I>().
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
A system with <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>() and without
<I>fork</I>()
should be useful, at least for realtime applications.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
A system with <I>fork</I>() and the <I>exec</I> family
should be able to implement <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
as library routines.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Two-Syntax</H3>

<P>

POSIX <I>exec</I> has several calling sequences with approximately
the same functionality.
These appear to be required for compatibility with existing practice.
Since the existing practice for the <I>posix_spawn*</I>() functions
is otherwise substantially unlike POSIX, we feel that
simplicity outweighs compatibility. There are, therefore, only two
names for the <I>posix_spawn*</I>() functions.
<P>

The parameter list does not differ between <I>posix_spawn</I>() and
<I>posix_spawnp</I>(); <I>posix_spawnp</I>() interprets the
second parameter more elaborately than <I>posix_spawn</I>().
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Compatibility with POSIX.5 (Ada)</H3>

<P>

The <I>Start_Process</I> and <I>Start_Process_Search</I> procedures
from the <I>POSIX_Process_Primitives</I> package from the
Ada language binding to POSIX.1 encapsulate <I>fork</I>() and <I>exec</I>
functionality in a manner similar to that of <I>posix_spawn</I>() and
<I>posix_spawnp</I>().
Originally, in keeping with our simplicity goal, the standard developers
had limited the capabilities of <I>posix_spawn</I>() and
<I>posix_spawnp</I>() to a subset of the capabilities of <I>Start_Process</I>
and <I>Start_Process_Search</I>; certain non-default
capabilities were not supported. However, based on suggestions by
the ballot group to improve file descriptor mapping or drop it,
and on the advice of an Ada Language Bindings working group member,
the standard developers decided that <I>posix_spawn</I>() and
<I>posix_spawnp</I>() should be sufficiently powerful to implement
<I>Start_Process</I> and <I>Start_Process_Search</I>. The
rationale is that if the Ada language binding to such a primitive
had already been approved as an IEEE standard, there can be
little justification for not approving the functionally-equivalent
parts of a C binding. The only three capabilities provided by
<I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>() that are not provided
by <I>Start_Process</I> and <I>Start_Process_Search</I> are
optionally specifying the child's process group ID, the set of signals
to be reset to default signal handling in the child process,
and the child's scheduling policy and parameters.
<P>

For the Ada language binding for <I>Start_Process</I> to be implemented
with <I>posix_spawn</I>(), that binding would need to
explicitly pass an empty signal mask and the parent's environment
to <I>posix_spawn</I>() whenever the caller of
<I>Start_Process</I> allowed these arguments to default, since <I>posix_spawn</I>()
does not provide such defaults. The ability of
<I>Start_Process</I> to mask user-specified signals during its execution
is functionally unique to the Ada language binding and
must be dealt with in the binding separately from the call to <I>posix_spawn</I>().
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Process Group</H3>

<P>

The process group inheritance field can be used to join the child
process with an existing process group. By assigning a value
of zero to the <I>spawn-pgroup</I> attribute of the object referenced
by <I>attrp</I>, the <I>setpgid</I>() mechanism will place the child
process in a new process group.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Threads</H3>

<P>

Without the <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>() functions,
systems without address translation can still use threads
to give an abstraction of concurrency. In many cases, thread creation
suffices, but it is not always a good substitute. The
<I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>() functions are considerably
&quot;heavier&quot; than thread creation. Processes have several
important attributes that threads do not. Even without address translation,
a process may have base-and-bound memory protection.
Each process has a process environment including security attributes
and file capabilities, and powerful scheduling attributes.
Processes abstract the behavior of non-uniform-memory-architecture
multi-processors better than threads, and they are more
convenient to use for activities that are not closely linked.
<P>

The <I>posix_spawn</I>() and <I>posix_spawnp</I>() functions may not
bring support for multiple processes to every
configuration. Process creation is not the only piece of operating
system support required to support multiple processes. The total
cost of support for multiple processes may be quite high in some circumstances.
Existing practice shows that support for multiple
processes is uncommon and threads are common among &quot;tiny kernels&quot;.
There should, therefore, probably continue to be AEPs for

<H3>Asynchronous Error Notification</H3>

<P>

A library implementation of <I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
may not be able to detect all possible errors before
it forks the child process. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 provides for an
error indication returned from a child process which
could not successfully complete the spawn operation via a special
exit status which may be detected using the status value returned
by <I>wait</I>() and <I>waitpid</I>().
<P>

The <I>stat_val</I> interface and the macros used to interpret it are
not well suited to the purpose of returning API errors,
but they are the only path available to a library implementation.
Thus, an implementation may cause the child process to exit with
exit status 127 for any error detected during the spawn process after
the <I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>() function
has successfully returned.
<P>

The standard developers had proposed using two additional macros to
interpret <I>stat_val</I>. The first, WIFSPAWNFAIL, would
have detected a status that indicated that the child exited because
of an error detected during the <I>posix_spawn</I>() or
<I>posix_spawnp</I>() operations rather than during actual execution
of the child process image; the second, WSPAWNERRNO, would
have extracted the error value if WIFSPAWNFAIL indicated a failure.
Unfortunately, the ballot group strongly opposed this because
it would make a library implementation of <I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
dependent on kernel modifications to <I>waitpid</I>() to be able to
embed special information in <I>stat_val</I> to indicate a
spawn failure.
<P>

The 8 bits of child process exit status that are guaranteed by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
to be accessible to the waiting
parent process are insufficient to disambiguate a spawn error from
any other kind of error that may be returned by an arbitrary
process image. No other bits of the exit status are required to be
visible in <I>stat_val</I>, so these macros could not be
strictly implemented at the library level. Reserving an exit status
of 127 for such spawn errors is consistent with the use of this
value by <I>system</I>() and <I>popen</I>() to signal
failures in these operations that occur after the function has returned
but before a shell is able to execute. The exit status of
127 does not uniquely identify this class of error, nor does it provide
any detailed information on the nature of the failure. Note
that a kernel implementation of <I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
is permitted (and encouraged) to return any possible
error as the function value, thus providing more detailed failure
information to the parent process.
<P>

Thus, no special macros are available to isolate asynchronous <I>posix_spawn</I>()
or <I>posix_spawnp</I>() errors. Instead,
errors detected by the <I>posix_spawn</I>() or <I>posix_spawnp</I>()
operations in the context of the child process before the new
process image executes are reported by setting the child's exit status
to 127. The calling process may use the WIFEXITED and
WEXITSTATUS macros on the <I>stat_val</I> stored by the <I>wait</I>()
or <I>waitpid</I>() functions to detect spawn failures to the extent
that other status values with
which the child process image may exit (before the parent can conclusively
determine that the child process image has begun
execution) are distinct from exit status 127.
