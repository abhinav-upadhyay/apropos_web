fputwc - put a wide-character code on a stream

wint_t fputwc(wchar_t</B> <I>wc</I><B>, FILE *</B><I>stream</I><B>);
<BR>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>fputwc</I>() function shall write the character corresponding
to the wide-character code <I>wc</I> to the output stream
pointed to by <I>stream</I>, at the position indicated by the associated
file-position indicator for the stream (if defined), and
advances the indicator appropriately. If the file cannot support positioning
requests, or if the stream was opened with append
mode, the character is appended to the output stream. If an error
occurs while writing the character, the shift state of the output
file is left in an undefined state.
<P>

The
<I>st_ctime</I> and <I>st_mtime</I> fields of the file shall be marked
for update between the successful execution of
<I>fputwc</I>() and the next successful completion of a call to <I>fflush</I>()
or <I>fclose</I>() on the same stream or a call to <I>exit</I>()
or <I>abort</I>(). 
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, <I>fputwc</I>() shall return <I>wc</I>.
Otherwise, it shall return WEOF, the error indicator for the
stream shall be set,  and <I>errno</I> shall be set to indicate
the error. 
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>fputwc</I>() function shall fail if either the stream is unbuffered
or data in the <I>stream</I>'s buffer needs to be
written, and:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor underlying <I>stream</I>
and the process would be delayed in the write
operation. 
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The file descriptor underlying <I>stream</I> is not a valid file descriptor
open for writing. 
<DT><B>EFBIG</B>

<DD>
An
attempt was made to write to a file that exceeds the maximum file
size or the process' file size limit. 
<DT><B>EFBIG</B>

<DD>
The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to write at or
beyond the offset maximum associated with the corresponding
stream. 
<DT><B>EILSEQ</B>

<DD>
The wide-character code <I>wc</I> does not correspond to a valid character.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
The write operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal,
and no data was transferred. 
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
A
physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is a member of a background
process group attempting to write to its controlling
terminal, TOSTOP is set, the process is neither ignoring nor blocking
SIGTTOU, and the process group of the process is orphaned.
This error may also be returned under implementation-defined conditions.
<DT><B>ENOSPC</B>

<DD>
There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file.
<DT><B>EPIPE</B>

<DD>
An
attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not open for reading
by any process. A SIGPIPE signal shall also be sent to the
thread. 
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>fputwc</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient storage space is available. 
<DT><B>ENXIO</B>

<DD>
A
request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside
the capabilities of the device.
