<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>lio_listio</I>() function shall initiate a list of I/O requests
with a single function call.
<P>

The <I>mode</I> argument takes one of the values LIO_WAIT or LIO_NOWAIT
declared in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/aio.h">aio.h</A>&gt;</I> and determines whether the function returns
when the I/O operations have been
completed, or as soon as the operations have been queued. If the <I>mode</I>
argument is LIO_WAIT, the function shall wait until
all I/O is complete and the <I>sig</I> argument shall be ignored.
<P>

If the <I>mode</I> argument is LIO_NOWAIT, the function shall return
immediately, and asynchronous notification shall occur,
according to the <I>sig</I> argument, when all the I/O operations complete.
If <I>sig</I> is NULL, then no asynchronous
notification shall occur. If <I>sig</I> is not NULL, asynchronous notification
occurs as specified in <I>Signal Generation and Delivery</I> when all
the requests in <I>list</I> have
completed.
<P>

The I/O requests enumerated by <I>list</I> are submitted in an unspecified
order.
<P>

The <I>list</I> argument is an array of pointers to <B>aiocb</B> structures.
The array contains <I>nent</I> elements. The array
may contain NULL elements, which shall be ignored.
<P>

The <I>aio_lio_opcode</I> field of each <B>aiocb</B> structure specifies
the operation to be performed. The supported operations
are LIO_READ, LIO_WRITE, and LIO_NOP; these symbols are defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/aio.h">aio.h</A>&gt;</I>. The
LIO_NOP operation causes the list entry to be ignored. If the <I>aio_lio_opcode</I>
element is equal to LIO_READ, then an I/O
operation is submitted as if by a call to <I>aio_read</I>() with the
<I>aiocbp</I> equal
to the address of the <B>aiocb</B> structure. If the <I>aio_lio_opcode</I>
element is equal to LIO_WRITE, then an I/O operation is
submitted as if by a call to <I>aio_write</I>() with the <I>aiocbp</I>
equal to the
address of the <B>aiocb</B> structure.
<P>

The <I>aio_fildes</I> member specifies the file descriptor on which
the operation is to be performed.
<P>

The <I>aio_buf</I> member specifies the address of the buffer to or
from which the data is transferred.
<P>

The <I>aio_nbytes</I> member specifies the number of bytes of data
to be transferred.
<P>

The members of the <B>aiocb</B> structure further describe the I/O
operation to be performed, in a manner identical to that of
the corresponding <B>aiocb</B> structure when used by the <I>aio_read</I>()
and <I>aio_write</I>() functions.
<P>

The <I>nent</I> argument specifies how many elements are members of
the list; that is, the length of the array.
<P>

The behavior of this function is altered according to the definitions
of synchronized I/O data integrity completion and
synchronized I/O file integrity completion if synchronized I/O is
enabled on the file associated with <I>aio_fildes</I>.
<P>

For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset maximum
established in the open file description associated with
<I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_fildes</I>.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

If the <I>mode</I> argument has the value LIO_NOWAIT, the <I>lio_listio</I>()
function shall return the value zero if the I/O
operations are successfully queued; otherwise, the function shall
return the value -1 and set <I>errno</I> to indicate the
error.
<P>

If the <I>mode</I> argument has the value LIO_WAIT, the <I>lio_listio</I>()
function shall return the value zero when all the
indicated I/O has completed successfully. Otherwise, <I>lio_listio</I>()
shall return a value of -1 and set <I>errno</I> to
indicate the error.
<P>

In either case, the return value only indicates the success or failure
of the <I>lio_listio</I>() call itself, not the status of
the individual I/O requests. In some cases one or more of the I/O
requests contained in the list may fail. Failure of an individual
request does not prevent completion of any other individual request.
To determine the outcome of each I/O request, the application
shall examine the error status associated with each <B>aiocb</B> control
block. The error statuses so returned are identical to
those returned as the result of an <I>aio_read</I>() or <I>aio_write</I>()
function.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>lio_listio</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The resources necessary to queue all the I/O requests were not available.
The application may check the error status for each
<B>aiocb</B> to determine the individual request(s) that failed.
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The number of entries indicated by <I>nent</I> would cause the system-wide
limit {AIO_MAX} to be exceeded.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The <I>mode</I> argument is not a proper value, or the value of <I>nent</I>
was greater than {AIO_LISTIO_MAX}.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
A signal was delivered while waiting for all I/O requests to complete
during an LIO_WAIT operation. Note that, since each I/O
operation invoked by <I>lio_listio</I>() may possibly provoke a signal
when it completes, this error return may be caused by the
completion of one (or more) of the very I/O operations being awaited.
Outstanding I/O requests are not canceled, and the
application shall examine each list element to determine whether the
request was initiated, canceled, or completed.
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
One or more of the individual I/O operations failed. The application
may check the error status for each <B>aiocb</B> structure
to determine the individual request(s) that failed.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

In addition to the errors returned by the <I>lio_listio</I>() function,
if the <I>lio_listio</I>() function succeeds or fails
with errors of [EAGAIN], [EINTR], or [EIO], then some of the I/O specified
by the list may have been initiated. If the
<I>lio_listio</I>() function fails with an error code other than [EAGAIN],
[EINTR], or [EIO], no operations from the list shall
have been initiated. The I/O operation indicated by each list element
can encounter errors specific to the individual read or write
function being performed. In this event, the error status for each
<B>aiocb</B> control block contains the associated error code.
The error codes that can be set are the same as would be set by a
<I>read</I>() or <I>write</I>() function, with the following additional
error codes possible:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The requested I/O operation was not queued due to resource limitations.
<DT><B>ECANCELED</B>

<DD>
The requested I/O was canceled before the I/O completed due to an
explicit <I>aio_cancel</I>() request.
<DT><B>EFBIG</B>

<DD>
The <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_lio_opcode</I> is LIO_WRITE, the file is a
regular file, <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_nbytes</I> is
greater than 0, and the <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_offset</I> is greater
than or equal to the offset maximum in the open file
description associated with <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_fildes</I>.
<DT><B>EINPROGRESS</B>

<DD>
The requested I/O is in progress.
<DT><B>EOVERFLOW</B>

<DD>
The <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_lio_opcode</I> is LIO_READ, the file is a
regular file, <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_nbytes</I> is
greater than 0, and the <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_offset</I> is before the
end-of-file and is greater than or equal to the offset
maximum in the open file description associated with <I>aiocbp</I>-&gt;<I>aio_fildes</I>.

<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

Although it may appear that there are inconsistencies in the specified
circumstances for error codes, the [EIO] error condition
applies when any circumstance relating to an individual operation
makes that operation fail. This might be due to a badly
formulated request (for example, the <I>aio_lio_opcode</I> field is
invalid, and <I>aio_error</I>() returns [EINVAL]) or might arise from
application behavior (for example, the
file descriptor is closed before the operation is initiated, and <I>aio_error</I>()
returns [EBADF]).
<P>

The limitation on the set of error codes returned when operations
from the list shall have been initiated enables applications
to know when operations have been started and whether <I>aio_error</I>()
is valid for a
specific operation.
