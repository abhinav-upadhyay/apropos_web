<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>recvfrom</I>() function shall receive a message from a connection-mode
or connectionless-mode socket. It is normally used
with connectionless-mode sockets because it permits the application
to retrieve the source address of received data.
<P>

The <I>recvfrom</I>() function takes the following arguments:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>socket</I><DD>
Specifies the socket file descriptor.
<DT><I>buffer</I><DD>
Points to the buffer where the message should be stored.
<DT><I>length</I><DD>
Specifies the length in bytes of the buffer pointed to by the <I>buffer</I>
argument.
<DT><I>flags</I><DD>
Specifies the type of message reception. Values of this argument are
formed by logically OR'ing zero or more of the following
values: 
<DT>MSG_PEEK<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Peeks at an incoming message. The data is treated as unread and the
next <I>recvfrom</I>() or similar function shall still
return this data.
</DL>

<DT>MSG_OOB<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Requests out-of-band data. The significance and semantics of out-of-band
data are protocol-specific.
</DL>

<DT>MSG_WAITALL<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
On SOCK_STREAM sockets this requests that the function block until
the full amount of data can be returned. The function may
return the smaller amount of data if the socket is a message-based
socket, if a signal is caught, if the connection is terminated,
if MSG_PEEK was specified, or if an error is pending for the socket.
</DL>

<P>
<DT><I>address</I><DD>
A null pointer, or points to a <B>sockaddr</B> structure in which the
sending address is to be stored. The length and format of
the address depend on the address family of the socket.
<DT><I>address_len</I><DD>
Specifies the length of the <B>sockaddr</B> structure pointed to by
the <I>address</I> argument.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>recvfrom</I>() function shall return the length of the message
written to the buffer pointed to by the <I>buffer</I>
argument. For message-based sockets, such as  SOCK_RAW,  SOCK_DGRAM,
and SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire message shall be read in a single operation.
If a message is too long to fit
in the supplied buffer, and MSG_PEEK is not set in the <I>flags</I>
argument, the excess bytes shall be discarded. For stream-based
sockets, such as SOCK_STREAM, message boundaries shall be ignored.
In this case, data shall be returned to the user as soon as it
becomes available, and no data shall be discarded.
<P>

If the MSG_WAITALL flag is not set, data shall be returned only up
to the end of the first message.
<P>

Not all protocols provide the source address for messages. If the
<I>address</I> argument is not a null pointer and the protocol
provides the source address of messages, the source address of the
received message shall be stored in the <B>sockaddr</B>
structure pointed to by the <I>address</I> argument, and the length
of this address shall be stored in the object pointed to by the
<I>address_len</I> argument.
<P>

If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of
the supplied <B>sockaddr</B> structure, the stored address
shall be truncated.
<P>

If the <I>address</I> argument is not a null pointer and the protocol
does not provide the source address of messages, the value
stored in the object pointed to by <I>address</I> is unspecified.
<P>

If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is not set
on the socket's file descriptor, <I>recvfrom</I>() shall
block until a message arrives. If no messages are available at the
socket and O_NONBLOCK is set on the socket's file descriptor,
<I>recvfrom</I>() shall fail and set <I>errno</I> to [EAGAIN] or [EWOULDBLOCK].
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, <I>recvfrom</I>() shall return the length
of the message in bytes. If no messages are available to
be received and the peer has performed an orderly shutdown, <I>recvfrom</I>()
shall return 0. Otherwise, the function shall return
-1 and set <I>errno</I> to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>recvfrom</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN </B>or EWOULDBLOCK

<DD>
<P>
The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and no data is waiting
to be received; or MSG_OOB is set and no out-of-band data
is available and either the socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK
or the socket does not support blocking to await
out-of-band data.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
The <I>socket</I> argument is not a valid file descriptor.
<DT><B>ECONNRESET</B>

<DD>
A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.
<DT><B>EINTR</B>

<DD>
A signal interrupted <I>recvfrom</I>() before any data was available.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The MSG_OOB flag is set and no out-of-band data is available.
<DT><B>ENOTCONN</B>

<DD>
A receive is attempted on a connection-mode socket that is not connected.
<DT><B>ENOTSOCK</B>

<DD>
The <I>socket</I> argument does not refer to a socket.
<DT><B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
The specified flags are not supported for this socket type.
<DT><B>ETIMEDOUT</B>

<DD>
The connection timed out during connection establishment, or due to
a transmission timeout on active connection.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>recvfrom</I>() function may fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EIO</B>

<DD>
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
<DT><B>ENOBUFS</B>

<DD>
Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the
operation.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.
