<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>kill</I>() function shall send a signal to a process or a group
of processes specified by <I>pid</I>. The signal to be
sent is specified by <I>sig</I> and is either one from the list given
in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/signal.h">signal.h</A>&gt;</I> or 0. If <I>sig</I> is 0 (the null signal), error
checking is performed but
no signal is actually sent. The null signal can be used to check the
validity of <I>pid</I>.
<P>

For a process to have permission to send a signal to a process designated
by <I>pid</I>, unless the sending process has
appropriate privileges, the real or effective user ID of the sending
process shall match the real or saved set-user-ID of the
receiving process.
<P>

If <I>pid</I> is greater than 0, <I>sig</I> shall be sent to the process
whose process ID is equal to <I>pid</I>.
<P>

If <I>pid</I> is 0, <I>sig</I> shall be sent to all processes (excluding
an unspecified set of system processes) whose process
group ID is equal to the process group ID of the sender, and for which
the process has permission to send a signal.
<P>

If <I>pid</I> is -1, <I>sig</I> shall be sent to all processes (excluding
an unspecified set of system processes) for which the
process has permission to send that signal.
<P>

If <I>pid</I> is negative, but not -1, <I>sig</I> shall be sent to all
processes (excluding an unspecified set of system
processes) whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of
<I>pid</I>, and for which the process has permission to send a
signal.
<P>

If the value of <I>pid</I> causes <I>sig</I> to be generated for the
sending process, and if <I>sig</I> is not blocked for the
calling thread and if no other thread has <I>sig</I> unblocked or is
waiting in a <I>sigwait</I>() function for <I>sig</I>, either <I>sig</I>
or at least one pending unblocked
signal shall be delivered to the sending thread before <I>kill</I>()
returns.
<P>

The user ID tests described above shall not be applied when sending
SIGCONT to a process that is a member of the same session as
the sending process.
<P>

An implementation that provides extended security controls may impose
further implementation-defined restrictions on the sending
of signals, including the null signal. In particular, the system may
deny the existence of some or all of the processes specified
by <I>pid</I>.
<P>

The <I>kill</I>() function is successful if the process has permission
to send <I>sig</I> to any of the processes specified by
<I>pid</I>. If <I>kill</I>() fails, no signal shall be sent.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>

Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall
be returned and <I>errno</I> set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

The <I>kill</I>() function shall fail if:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value of the <I>sig</I> argument is an invalid or unsupported signal
number.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The process does not have permission to send the signal to any receiving
process.
<DT><B>ESRCH</B>

<DD>
No process or process group can be found corresponding to that specified
by <I>pid</I>.

<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

The semantics for permission checking for <I>kill</I>() differed between
System V and most other implementations, such as
Version 7 or 4.3 BSD. The semantics chosen for this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
agree with System V. Specifically, a
set-user-ID process cannot protect itself against signals (or at least
not against SIGKILL) unless it changes its real user ID.
This choice allows the user who starts an application to send it signals
even if it changes its effective user ID. The other
semantics give more power to an application that wants to protect
itself from the user who ran it.
<P>

Some implementations provide semantic extensions to the <I>kill</I>()
function when the absolute value of <I>pid</I> is greater
than some maximum, or otherwise special, value. Negative values are
a flag to <I>kill</I>(). Since most implementations return
[ESRCH] in this case, this behavior is not included in this volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, although a conforming
implementation could provide such an extension.
<P>

The implementation-defined processes to which a signal cannot be sent
may include the scheduler or <I>init</I>.
<P>

There was initially strong sentiment to specify that, if <I>pid</I>
specifies that a signal be sent to the calling process and
that signal is not blocked, that signal would be delivered before
<I>kill</I>() returns. This would permit a process to call
<I>kill</I>() and be guaranteed that the call never return. However,
historical implementations that provide only the <I>signal</I>() function
make only the weaker guarantee in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, because they only deliver one signal each
time a process enters the kernel. Modifications to such
implementations to support the <I>sigaction</I>() function generally
require entry to the
kernel following return from a signal-catching function, in order
to restore the signal mask. Such modifications have the effect of
satisfying the stronger requirement, at least when <I>sigaction</I>()
is used, but not
necessarily when <I>signal</I>() is used. The developers of this volume
of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 considered making the stronger requirement
except when <I>signal</I>() is used, but felt this would be unnecessarily
complex. Implementors are encouraged
to meet the stronger requirement whenever possible. In practice, the
weaker requirement is the same, except in the rare case when
two signals arrive during a very short window. This reasoning also
applies to a similar requirement for <I>sigprocmask</I>().
<P>

In 4.2 BSD, the SIGCONT signal can be sent to any descendant process
regardless of user-ID security checks. This allows a job
control shell to continue a job even if processes in the job have
altered their user IDs (as in the <I>su</I> command). In keeping
with the addition of the concept of sessions, similar functionality
is provided by allowing the SIGCONT signal to be sent to any
process in the same session regardless of user ID security checks.
This is less restrictive than BSD in the sense that ancestor
processes (in the same session) can now be the recipient. It is more
restrictive than BSD in the sense that descendant processes
that form new sessions are now subject to the user ID checks. A similar
relaxation of security is not necessary for the other job
control signals since those signals are typically sent by the terminal
driver in recognition of special characters being typed; the
terminal driver bypasses all security checks.
<P>

In secure implementations, a process may be restricted from sending
a signal to a process having a different security label. In
order to prevent the existence or nonexistence of a process from being
used as a covert channel, such processes should appear
nonexistent to the sender; that is, [ESRCH] should be returned, rather
than [EPERM], if <I>pid</I> refers only to such
processes.
<P>

Existing implementations vary on the result of a <I>kill</I>() with
<I>pid</I> indicating an inactive process (a terminated
process that has not been waited for by its parent). Some indicate
success on such a call (subject to permission checking), while
others give an error of [ESRCH]. Since the definition of process lifetime
in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 covers
inactive processes, the [ESRCH] error as described is inappropriate
in this case. In particular, this means that an application
cannot have a parent process check for termination of a particular
child with <I>kill</I>(). (Usually this is done with the null
signal; this can be done reliably with <I>waitpid</I>().)
<P>

There is some belief that the name <I>kill</I>() is misleading, since
the function is not always intended to cause process
termination. However, the name is common to all historical implementations,
and any change would be in conflict with the goal of
minimal changes to existing application code.
