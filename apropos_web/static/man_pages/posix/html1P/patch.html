<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>patch</i> utility shall read a source (patch) file containing any of the three forms of difference (diff) listings produced by the  <i>diff</i> utility (normal, context, or in the style of  <i>ed</i>) and apply those differences to a file. By default, <i>patch</i> shall read from the standard input.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>patch</i> utility shall attempt to determine the type of the  <i>diff</i> listing, unless overruled by a  <b>-c</b>, <b>-e</b>, or <b>-n</b> option.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the patch file contains more than one patch, <i>patch</i> shall attempt to apply each of them as if they came from separate patch files. (In this case, the application shall ensure that the name of the patch file is determinable for each  <i>diff</i> listing.)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> The  <i>patch</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following options shall be supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-b</b></dt>
<dd>
Save a copy of the original contents of each modified file, before the differences are applied, in a file of the same name with the suffix  <b>.orig</b> appended to it. If the file already exists, it shall be overwritten; if multiple patches are applied to the same file, the  <b>.orig</b> file shall be written only for the first patch. When the  <b>-o</b> <i>outfile</i> option is also specified,  <i>file</i> <b>.orig</b> shall not be created but, if <i>outfile</i> already exists,  <i>outfile</i> <b>.orig</b> shall be created.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-c</b></dt>
<dd>
Interpret the patch file as a context difference (the output of the utility  <i>diff</i> when the  <b>-c</b> or <b>-C</b> options are specified).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-d&#160;</b> <i>dir</i></dt>
<dd>
Change the current directory to <i>dir</i> before processing as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-D&#160;</b> <i>define</i></dt>
<dd>
Mark changes with one of the following C preprocessor constructs:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">

optionally combined with the C preprocessor construct <b>#else</b>. If the patched file is processed with the C preprocessor, where the macro  <i>define</i> is defined, the output shall contain the changes from the patch file; otherwise, the output shall not contain the patches specified in the patch file.<dl>
<dt>
<b>-e</b></dt>
<dd>
Interpret the patch file as an <i>ed</i> script, rather than a <i>diff</i> script.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-i&#160;</b> <i>patchfile</i></dt>
<dd>
Read the patch information from the file named by the pathname <i>patchfile</i>, rather than the standard input.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-l</b></dt>
<dd>
(The letter ell.) Cause any sequence of &lt;blank&gt;s in the difference script to match any sequence of &lt;blank&gt;s in the input file. Other characters shall be matched exactly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-n</b></dt>
<dd>
Interpret the script as a normal difference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-N</b></dt>
<dd>
Ignore patches where the differences have already been applied to the file; by default, already-applied patches shall be rejected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-o&#160;</b> <i>outfile</i></dt>
<dd>
Instead of modifying the files (specified by the <i>file</i> operand or the difference listings) directly, write a copy of the file referenced by each patch, with the appropriate differences applied, to  <i>outfile</i>. Multiple patches for a single file shall be applied to the intermediate versions of the file created by any previous patches, and shall result in multiple, concatenated versions of the file being written to  <i>outfile</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-p&#160;</b> <i>num</i></dt>
<dd>
For all pathnames in the patch file that indicate the names of files to be patched, delete  <i>num</i> pathname components from the beginning of each pathname. If the pathname in the patch file is absolute, any leading slashes shall be considered the first component (that is,  <b>-p&#160;1</b> shall remove the leading slashes). Specifying  <b>-p&#160;0</b> shall cause the full pathname to be used. If  <b>-p</b> is not specified, only the basename (the final pathname component) shall be used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-R</b></dt>
<dd>
Reverse the sense of the patch script; that is, assume that the difference script was created from the new version to the old version. The  <b>-R</b> option cannot be used with <i>ed</i> scripts. The  <i>patch</i> utility shall attempt to reverse each portion of the script before applying it. Rejected differences shall be saved in swapped format. If this option is not specified, and until a portion of the patch file is successfully applied,  <i>patch</i> attempts to apply each portion in its reversed sense as well as in its normal sense. If the attempt is successful, the user shall be prompted to determine whether the  <b>-R</b> option should be set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-r&#160;</b> <i>rejectfile</i></dt>
<dd>
Override the default reject filename. In the default case, the reject file shall have the same name as the output file, with the suffix  <b>.rej</b> appended to it; see Patch Application .<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h1>OUTPUT FILES</h1> The output of the  <i>patch</i> utility, the save files ( <b>.orig</b> suffixes), and the reject files (  <b>.rej</b> suffixes) shall be text files.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h1> A patch file may contain patching instructions for more than one file; filenames shall be determined as specified in Filename Determination . When the  <b>-b</b> option is specified, for each patched file, the original shall be saved in a file of the same name with the suffix  <b>.orig</b> appended to it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For each patched file, a reject file may also be created as noted in Patch Application . In the absence of a  <b>-r</b> option, the name of this file shall be formed by appending the suffix  <b>.rej</b> to the original filename.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Patch File Format</h2> The patch file shall contain zero or more lines of header information followed by one or more patches. Each patch shall contain zero or more lines of filename identification in the format produced by  <i>diff</i> <b>-c</b>, and one or more sets of  <i>diff</i> output, which are customarily called  <i>hunks</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>patch</i> utility shall recognize the following expression in the header information:<dl>
<dt>
<b>Index:&#160;</b> <i>pathname</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The file to be patched is named <i>pathname</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If all lines (including headers) within a patch begin with the same leading sequence of &lt;blank&gt;s, the  <i>patch</i> utility shall remove this sequence before proceeding. Within each patch, if the type of difference is context, the  <i>patch</i> utility shall recognize the following expressions:<dl>
<dt>
***&#160;<i>filename&#160;timestamp</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The patches arose from <i>filename</i>.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
---&#160;<i>filename&#160;timestamp</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The patches should be applied to <i>filename</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each hunk within a patch shall be the <i>diff</i> output to change a line range within the original file. The line numbers for successive hunks within a patch shall occur in ascending order.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Filename Determination</h2> If no  <i>file</i> operand is specified, <i>patch</i> shall perform the following steps to determine the filename to use:<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
If the type of <i>diff</i> is context, the <i>patch</i> utility shall delete pathname components (as specified by the  <b>-p</b> option) from the filename on the line beginning with  <b>&quot;***&quot;</b>, then test for the existence of this file relative to the current directory (or the directory specified with the  <b>-d</b> option). If the file exists, the  <i>patch</i> utility shall use this filename.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
If the type of <i>diff</i> is context, the <i>patch</i> utility shall delete the pathname components (as specified by the  <b>-p</b> option) from the filename on the line beginning with  <b>&quot;---&quot;</b>, then test for the existence of this file relative to the current directory (or the directory specified with the  <b>-d</b> option). If the file exists, the  <i>patch</i> utility shall use this filename.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 3.</dt>
<dd>
If the header information contains a line beginning with the string  <b>Index:</b>, the <i>patch</i> utility shall delete pathname components (as specified by the  <b>-p</b> option) from this line, then test for the existence of this file relative to the current directory (or the directory specified with the  <b>-d</b> option). If the file exists, the  <i>patch</i> utility shall use this filename.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 4.</dt>
<dd>
If an <b>SCCS</b> directory exists in the current directory, <i>patch</i> shall attempt to perform a  <i>get</i> <b>-e</b> <b>SCCS/s.</b> <i>filename</i> command to retrieve an editable version of the file. If the file exists, the  <i>patch</i> utility shall use this filename.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 5.</dt>
<dd>
The <i>patch</i> utility shall write a prompt to standard output and request a filename interactively from the controlling terminal (for example,  <b>/dev/tty</b>).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Patch Application</h2> If the  <b>-c</b>, <b>-e</b>, or <b>-n</b> option is present, the <i>patch</i> utility shall interpret information within each hunk as a context difference, an  <i>ed</i> difference, or a normal difference, respectively. In the absence of any of these options, the  <i>patch</i> utility shall determine the type of difference based on the format of information within the hunk.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For each hunk, the <i>patch</i> utility shall begin to search for the place to apply the patch at the line number at the beginning of the hunk, plus or minus any offset used in applying the previous hunk. If lines matching the hunk context are not found,  <i>patch</i> shall scan both forwards and backwards at least 1000 bytes for a set of lines that match the hunk context.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If no such place is found and it is a context difference, then another scan shall take place, ignoring the first and last line of context. If that fails, the first two and last two lines of context shall be ignored and another scan shall be made. Implementations may search more extensively for installation locations.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If no location can be found, the <i>patch</i> utility shall append the hunk to the reject file. The rejected hunk shall be written in context-difference format regardless of the format of the patch file. If the input was a normal or  <i>ed</i>-style difference, the reject file may contain differences with zero lines of context. The line numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be different from the line numbers in the patch file since they shall reflect the approximate locations for the failed hunks in the new file rather than the old one.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the type of patch is an <i>ed</i> diff, the implementation may accomplish the patching by invoking the  <i>ed</i> utility.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1> The following exit values shall be returned:<dl>
<dt>
&#160;0</dt>
<dd>
Successful completion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;1</dt>
<dd>

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> Some of the functionality in historical  <i>patch</i> implementations was not specified. The following documents those features present in historical implementations that have not been specified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A deleted piece of functionality was the <b>'+'</b> pseudo-option allowing an additional set of options and a patch file operand to be given. This was seen as being insufficiently useful to standardize.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In historical implementations, if the string <b>&quot;Prereq:&quot;</b> appeared in the header, the  <i>patch</i> utility would search for the corresponding version information (the string specified in the header, delimited by &lt;blank&gt;s or the beginning or end of a line or the file) anywhere in the original file. This was deleted as too simplistic and insufficiently trustworthy a mechanism to standardize. For example, if:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>Prereq: 1.2</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
were in the header, the presence of a delimited 1.2 anywhere in the file would satisfy the prerequisite.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following options were dropped from historical implementations of  <i>patch</i> as insufficiently useful to standardize:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-b</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>-b</b> option historically provided a method for changing the name extension of the backup file from the default  <b>.orig</b>. This option has been modified and retained in this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-F</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>-F</b> option specified the number of lines of a context diff to ignore when searching for a place to install a patch.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-f</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>-f</b> option historically caused <i>patch</i> not to request additional information from the user.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-r</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>-r</b> option historically provided a method of overriding the extension of the reject file from the default  <b>.rej</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-s</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>-s</b> option historically caused <i>patch</i> to work silently unless an error occurred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-x</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>-x</b> option historically set internal debugging flags.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In some file system implementations, the saving of a <b>.orig</b> file may produce unwanted results. In the case of 12, 13, or 14-character filenames (on file systems supporting 14-character maximum filenames), the  <b>.orig</b> file overwrites the new file. The reject file may also exceed this filename limit. It was suggested, due to some historical practice, that a tilde (  <b>'~'</b> ) suffix be used instead of <b>.orig</b> and some other character instead of the  <b>.rej</b> suffix. This was rejected because it is not obvious to the user which file is which. The suffixes  <b>.orig</b> and <b>.rej</b> are clearer and more understandable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-b</b> option has the opposite sense in some historical implementations-do not save the  <b>.orig</b> file. The default case here is not to save the files, making  <i>patch</i> behave more consistently with the other standard utilities.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-w</b> option in early proposals was changed to <b>-l</b> to match historical practice.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-N</b> option was included because without it, a non-interactive application cannot reject previously applied patches. For example, if a user is piping the output of  <i>diff</i> into the  <i>patch</i> utility, and the user only wants to patch a file to a newer version non-interactively, the  <b>-N</b> option is required.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Changes to the <b>-l</b> option description were proposed to allow matching across &lt;newline&gt;s in addition to just &lt;blank&gt;s. Since this is not historical practice, and since some ambiguities could result, it is suggested that future developments in this area utilize another option letter, such as  <b>-L</b>.</div>
