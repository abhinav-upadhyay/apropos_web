<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>sh</i> utility is a command language interpreter that shall execute commands read from a command line string, the standard input, or a specified file. The application shall ensure that the commands to be executed are expressed in the language described in  <i>Shell Command Language</i> .<div class="spacer">
</div>
Pathname expansion shall not fail due to the size of a file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Shell input and output redirections have an implementation-defined offset maximum that is established in the open file description.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> The  <i>sh</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, with an extension for support of a leading plus sign (  <b>'+'</b> ) as noted below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-a</b>, <b>-b</b>, <b>-C</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-m</b>, <b>-n</b>,  <b>-o</b> <i>option</i>, <b>-u</b>, <b>-v</b>, and  <b>-x</b> options are described as part of the <i>set</i> utility in  <i>Special Built-In Utilities</i> . The option letters derived from the  <i>set</i> special built-in shall also be accepted with a leading plus sign (  <b>'+'</b> ) instead of a leading hyphen (meaning the reverse case of the option as described in this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following additional options shall be supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-c</b></dt>
<dd>
Read commands from the <i>command_string</i> operand. Set the value of special parameter 0 (see  <i>Special Parameters</i> ) from the value of the  <i>command_name</i> operand and the positional parameters ($1, $2, and so on) in sequence from the remaining  <i>argument</i> operands. No commands shall be read from the standard input.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-i</b></dt>
<dd>
Specify that the shell is <i>interactive</i>; see below. An implementation may treat specifying the  <b>-i</b> option as an error if the real user ID of the calling process does not equal the effective user ID or if the real group ID does not equal the effective group ID.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-s</b></dt>
<dd>
Read commands from the standard input.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

If there are no operands and the <b>-c</b> option is not specified, the  <b>-s</b> option shall be assumed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <b>-i</b> option is present, or if there are no operands and the shell's standard input and standard error are attached to a terminal, the shell is considered to be  <i>interactive</i>.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPERANDS</h1> The following operands shall be supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-</b></dt>
<dd>
A single hyphen shall be treated as the first operand and then ignored. If both  <b>'-'</b> and <b>&quot;--&quot;</b> are given as arguments, or if other operands precede the single hyphen, the results are undefined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>argument</i></dt>
<dd>
The positional parameters ($1, $2, and so on) shall be set to <i>arguments</i>, if any.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>command_file</i></dt>
<dd>
The pathname of a file containing commands. If the pathname contains one or more slash characters, the implementation attempts to read that file; the file need not be executable. If the pathname does not contain a slash character:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
The implementation shall attempt to read that file from the current working directory; the file need not be executable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
If the file is not in the current working directory, the implementation may perform a search for an executable file using the value of  <i>PATH</i>,  as described in <i>Command Search and Execution</i> .</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Special parameter 0 (see <i>Special Parameters</i> ) shall be set to the value of  <i>command_file</i>. If <i>sh</i> is called using a synopsis form that omits  <i>command_file</i>, special parameter 0 shall be set to the value of the first argument passed to  <i>sh</i> from its parent (for example,  <i>argv</i>[0] for a C program), which is normally a pathname used to execute the  <i>sh</i> utility.<dl>
<dt>
<i>command_name</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A string assigned to special parameter 0 when executing the commands in  <i>command_string</i>. If <i>command_name</i> is not specified, special parameter 0 shall be set to the value of the first argument passed to  <i>sh</i> from its parent (for example,  <i>argv</i>[0] for a C program), which is normally a pathname used to execute the  <i>sh</i> utility.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<i>command_string</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div class="section">
<h1>STDIN</h1> The standard input shall be used only if one of the following is true:<dl>

<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the INPUT FILES section.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the shell is using standard input and it invokes a command that also uses standard input, the shell shall ensure that the standard input file pointer points directly after the command it has read when the command begins execution. It shall not read ahead in such a manner that any characters intended to be read by the invoked command are consumed by the shell (whether interpreted by the shell or not) or that characters that are not read by the invoked command are not seen by the shell. When the command expecting to read standard input is started asynchronously by an interactive shell, it is unspecified whether characters are read by the command or interpreted by the shell.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the standard input to <i>sh</i> is a FIFO or terminal device and is set to non-blocking reads, then  <i>sh</i> shall enable blocking reads on standard input. This shall remain in effect when the command completes.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>INPUT FILES</h1> The input file shall be a text file, except that line lengths shall be unlimited. If the input file is empty or consists solely of blank lines or comments, or both,  <i>sh</i> shall exit with a zero exit status.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h1> The following environment variables shall affect the execution of  <i>sh</i>:<dl>
<dt>
<i>ENV</i></dt>
<dd>
This variable, when and only when an interactive shell is invoked, shall be subjected to parameter expansion (see  <i>Parameter Expansion</i> ) by the shell, and the resulting value shall be used as a pathname of a file containing shell commands to execute in the current environment. The file need not be executable. If the expanded value of  <i>ENV</i> is not an absolute pathname, the results are unspecified.  <i>ENV</i> shall be ignored if the real and effective user IDs or real and effective group IDs of the process are different.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>FCEDIT</i></dt>
<dd>
This variable, when expanded by the shell, shall determine the default value for the  <b>-e</b> <i>editor</i> option's  <i>editor</i> option-argument. If <i>FCEDIT</i> is null or unset, <i>ed</i> shall be used as the editor. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of this variable only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>HISTFILE</i></dt>
<dd>
Determine a pathname naming a command history file. If the <i>HISTFILE</i> variable is not set, the shell may attempt to access or create a file  <b>.sh_history</b> in the directory referred to by the  <i>HOME</i> environment variable. If the shell cannot obtain both read and write access to, or create, the history file, it shall use an unspecified mechanism that allows the history to operate properly. (References to history &quot;file&quot; in this section shall be understood to mean this unspecified mechanism in such cases.) An implementation may choose to access this variable only when initializing the history file; this initialization shall occur when  <i>fc</i> or <i>sh</i> first attempt to retrieve entries from, or add entries to, the file, as the result of commands issued by the user, the file named by the  <i>ENV</i> variable, or implementation-defined system start-up files. Implementations may choose to disable the history list mechanism for users with appropriate privileges who do not set  <i>HISTFILE ;</i> the specific circumstances under which this occurs are implementation-defined. If more than one instance of the shell is using the same history file, it is unspecified how updates to the history file from those shells interact. As entries are deleted from the history file, they shall be deleted oldest first. It is unspecified when history file entries are physically removed from the history file. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of this variable only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>HISTSIZE</i></dt>
<dd>
Determine a decimal number representing the limit to the number of previous commands that are accessible. If this variable is unset, an unspecified default greater than or equal to 128 shall be used. The maximum number of commands in the history list is unspecified, but shall be at least 128. An implementation may choose to access this variable only when initializing the history file, as described under  <i>HISTFILE</i>.  Therefore, it is unspecified whether changes made to  <i>HISTSIZE</i> after the history file has been initialized are effective.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>HOME</i></dt>
<dd>
Determine the pathname of the user's home directory. The contents of  <i>HOME</i> are used in tilde expansion as described in <i>Tilde</i>  <i>Expansion</i> . This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of this variable only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>IFS</i></dt>
<dd>
(Input Field Separators.) A string treated as a list of characters that shall be used for field splitting and to split lines into words with the  <i>read</i> command. See <i>Field</i>  <i>Splitting</i> . If <i>IFS</i> is not set, the shell shall behave as if the value of  <i>IFS</i> were &lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt;, and &lt;newline&gt;. Implementations may ignore the value of  <i>IFS</i> in the environment at the time  <i>sh</i> is invoked, treating  <i>IFS</i> as if it were not set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>LANG</i></dt>
<dd>
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>LC_ALL</i></dt>
<dd>
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>LC_COLLATE</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Determine the behavior of range expressions, equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements within pattern matching.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>LC_CTYPE</i></dt>
<dd>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files), which characters are defined as letters (character class  <b>alpha</b>), and the behavior of character classes within pattern matching.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>LC_MESSAGES</i></dt>
<dd>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>MAIL</i></dt>
<dd>
Determine a pathname of the user's mailbox file for purposes of incoming mail notification. If this variable is set, the shell shall inform the user if the file named by the variable is created or if its modification time has changed. Informing the user shall be accomplished by writing a string of unspecified format to standard error prior to the writing of the next primary prompt string. Such check shall be performed only after the completion of the interval defined by the  <i>MAILCHECK</i> variable after the last such check. The user shall be informed only if  <i>MAIL</i> is set and  <i>MAILPATH</i> is not set. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of this variable only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>MAILCHECK</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Establish a decimal integer value that specifies how often (in seconds) the shell shall check for the arrival of mail in the files specified by the  <i>MAILPATH</i> or <i>MAIL</i> variables. The default value shall be 600 seconds. If set to zero, the shell shall check before issuing each primary prompt. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of this variable only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>MAILPATH</i></dt>
<dd>
Provide a list of pathnames and optional messages separated by colons. If this variable is set, the shell shall inform the user if any of the files named by the variable are created or if any of their modification times change. (See the preceding entry for  <i>MAIL</i> for descriptions of mail arrival and user informing.) Each pathname can be followed by  <b>'%'</b> and a string that shall be subjected to parameter expansion and written to standard error when the modification time changes. If a  <b>'%'</b> character in the pathname is preceded by a backslash, it shall be treated as a literal  <b>'%'</b> in the pathname. The default message is unspecified.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>MAILPATH</i> environment variable takes precedence over the  <i>MAIL</i> variable. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of this variable only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.<dl>
<dt>
<i>NLSPATH</i></dt>
<dd>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>  <i>.</i></dd>
</dl>

<h1>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h1> See  <i>Shell Command Language</i> . The following additional capabilities are supported on systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Command History List</h2> When the  <i>sh</i> utility is being used interactively, it shall maintain a list of commands previously entered from the terminal in the file named by the  <i>HISTFILE</i> environment variable. The type, size, and internal format of this file are unspecified. Multiple  <i>sh</i> processes can share access to the file for a user, if file access permissions allow this; see the description of the  <i>HISTFILE</i> environment variable.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Command Line Editing</h2> When  <i>sh</i> is being used interactively from a terminal, the current command and the command history (see  <i>fc</i> ) can be edited using  <i>vi</i>-mode command line editing. This mode uses commands, described below, similar to a subset of those described in the  <i>vi</i> utility. Implementations may offer other command line editing modes corresponding to other editing utilities.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>set</i> <b>-o</b> <i>vi</i> shall enable  <i>vi</i>-mode editing and place <i>sh</i> into <i>vi</i> insert mode (see Command Line Editing (vi-mode) ). This command also shall disable any other editing mode that the implementation may provide. The command  <i>set</i> <b>+o</b> <i>vi</i> disables <i>vi</i>-mode editing.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Certain block-mode terminals may be unable to support shell command line editing. If a terminal is unable to provide either edit mode, it need not be possible to  <i>set</i> <b>-o</b> <i>vi</i> when using the shell on this terminal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the following sections, the characters <i>erase</i>, <i>interrupt</i>,  <i>kill</i>, and <i>end-of-file</i> are those set by the  <i>stty</i> utility.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Command Line Editing (vi-mode)</h2> In  <i>vi</i> editing mode, there shall be a distinguished line, the edit line. All the editing operations which modify a line affect the edit line. The edit line is always the newest line in the command history buffer.<div class="spacer">
</div>
With <i>vi</i>-mode enabled, <i>sh</i> can be switched between insert mode and command mode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When in insert mode, an entered character shall be inserted into the command line, except as noted in vi Line Editing Insert Mode . Upon entering  <i>sh</i> and after termination of the previous command,  <i>sh</i> shall be in insert mode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Typing an escape character shall switch <i>sh</i> into command mode (see vi Line Editing Command Mode ). In command mode, an entered character shall either invoke a defined operation, be used as part of a multi-character operation, or be treated as an error. A character that is not recognized as part of an editing command shall terminate any specific editing command and shall alert the terminal. Typing the  <i>interrupt</i> character in command mode shall cause  <i>sh</i> to terminate command line editing on the current command line, reissue the prompt on the next line of the terminal, and reset the command history (see  <i>fc</i> ) so that the most recently executed command is the previous command (that is, the command that was being edited when it was interrupted is not reentered into the history).<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the following sections, the phrase &quot;move the cursor to the beginning of the word&quot; shall mean &quot;move the cursor to the first character of the current word&quot; and the phrase &quot;move the cursor to the end of the word&quot; shall mean &quot;move the cursor to the last character of the current word&quot;. The phrase &quot;beginning of the command line&quot; indicates the point between the end of the prompt string issued by the shell (or the beginning of the terminal line, if there is no prompt string) and the first character of the command text.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>vi Line Editing Insert Mode</h2> While in insert mode, any character typed shall be inserted in the current command line, unless it is from the following set.<dl>
<dt>
&lt;newline&gt;</dt>
<dd>
Execute the current command line. If the current command line is not empty, this line shall be entered into the command history (see  <i>fc</i> ).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>erase</i></dt>
<dd>
Delete the character previous to the current cursor position and move the current cursor position back one character. In insert mode, characters shall be erased from both the screen and the buffer when backspacing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>interrupt</i></dt>
<dd>
Terminate command line editing with the same effects as described for interrupting command mode; see Command Line Editing (vi-mode) .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>kill</i></dt>
<dd>
Clear all the characters from the input line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&lt;control&gt;-V</dt>
<dd>
Insert the next character input, even if the character is otherwise a special insert mode character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&lt;control&gt;-W</dt>
<dd>
Delete the characters from the one preceding the cursor to the preceding word boundary. The word boundary in this case is the closer to the cursor of either the beginning of the line or a character that is in neither the  <b>blank</b> nor <b>punct</b> character classification of the current locale.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>end-of-file</i></dt>
<dd>
Interpreted as the end of input in <i>sh</i>. This interpretation shall occur only at the beginning of an input line. If  <i>end-of-file</i> is entered other than at the beginning of the line, the results are unspecified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&lt;ESC&gt;</dt>
<dd>
Place <i>sh</i> into command mode.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>vi Line Editing Command Mode</h2> In command mode for the command line editing feature, decimal digits not beginning with 0 that precede a command letter shall be remembered. Some commands use these decimal digits as a count number that affects the operation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The term <i>motion command</i> represents one of the commands:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>&lt;space&gt;  0  b  F  l  W  ^  $  ;  E  f  T  w  |  ,  B  e  h  t</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the current line is not the edit line, any command that modifies the current line shall cause the content of the current line to replace the content of the edit line, and the current line shall become the edit line. This replacement cannot be undone (see the  <b>u</b> and <b>U</b> commands below). The modification requested shall then be performed to the edit line. When the current line is the edit line, the modification shall be done directly to the edit line.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any command that is preceded by <i>count</i> shall take a count (the numeric value of any preceding decimal digits). Unless otherwise noted, this count shall cause the specified operation to repeat by the number of times specified by the count. Also unless otherwise noted, a  <i>count</i> that is out of range is considered an error condition and shall alert the terminal, but neither the cursor position, nor the command line, shall change.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The terms <i>word</i> and <i>bigword</i> are used as defined in the  <i>vi</i> description. The term  <i>save buffer</i> corresponds to the term <i>unnamed buffer</i> in  <i>vi</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following commands shall be recognized in command mode:<dl>
<dt>
&lt;newline&gt;</dt>
<dd>
Execute the current command line. If the current command line is not empty, this line shall be entered into the command history (see  <i>fc</i> ).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&lt;control&gt;-L</dt>
<dd>
Redraw the current command line. Position the cursor at the same location on the redrawn line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>#</b></dt>
<dd>
Insert the character <b>'#'</b> at the beginning of the current command line and treat the resulting edit line as a comment. This line shall be entered into the command history; see  <i>fc</i> .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>=</b></dt>
<dd>
Display the possible shell word expansions (see <i>Word Expansions</i> ) of the bigword at the current command line position.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Note:</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
This does not modify the content of the current line, and therefore does not cause the current line to become the edit line.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
These expansions shall be displayed on subsequent terminal lines. If the bigword contains none of the characters  <b>'?'</b>,  <b>'*'</b>, or <b>'['</b>, an asterisk ( <b>'*'</b> ) shall be implicitly assumed at the end. If any directories are matched, these expansions shall have a  <b>'/'</b> character appended. After the expansion, the line shall be redrawn, the cursor repositioned at the current cursor position, and  <i>sh</i> shall be placed in command mode.<dl>
<dt>
<b>\</b></dt>
<dd>

<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> Standard input and standard error are the files that determine whether a shell is interactive when  <b>-i</b> is not specified. For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

create interactive and non-interactive shells, respectively. Although both accept terminal input, the results of error conditions are different, as described in  <i>Consequences of Shell</i>  <i>Errors</i> ; in the second example a redirection error encountered by a special built-in utility aborts the shell.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A conforming application must protect its first operand, if it starts with a plus sign, by preceding it with the  <b>&quot;--&quot;</b> argument that denotes the end of the options.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Applications should note that the standard <i>PATH</i> to the shell cannot be assumed to be either  <b>/bin/sh</b> or  <b>/usr/bin/sh</b>, and should be determined by interrogation of the  <i>PATH</i> returned by <i>getconf</i> <i>PATH</i>,  ensuring that the returned pathname is an absolute pathname and not a shell built-in.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, to determine the location of the standard <i>sh</i> utility:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>command -v sh</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
On some implementations this might return:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>/usr/xpg4/bin/sh</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Furthermore, on systems that support executable scripts (the <b>&quot;#!&quot;</b> construct), it is recommended that applications using executable scripts install them using  <i>getconf</i> <b>-v</b> to determine the shell pathname and update the  <b>&quot;#!&quot;</b> script appropriately as it is being installed (for example, with  <i>sed</i>). For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">

<h1>RATIONALE</h1> The  <i>sh</i> utility and the <i>set</i> special built-in utility share a common set of options.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The KornShell ignores the contents of <i>IFS</i> upon entry to the script. A conforming application cannot rely on importing  <i>IFS</i>.  One justification for this, beyond security considerations, is to assist possible future shell compilers. Allowing  <i>IFS</i> to be imported from the environment prevents many optimizations that might otherwise be performed via dataflow analysis of the script itself.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The text in the STDIN section about non-blocking reads concerns an instance of  <i>sh</i> that has been invoked, probably by a C-language program, with standard input that has been opened using the O_NONBLOCK flag; see  <i>open</i>() in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001. If the shell did not reset this flag, it would immediately terminate because no input data would be available yet and that would be considered the same as end-of-file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The options associated with a <i>restricted shell</i> (command name  <i>rsh</i> and the <b>-r</b> option) were excluded because the standard developers considered that the implied level of security could not be achieved and they did not want to raise false expectations.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On systems that support set-user-ID scripts, a historical trapdoor has been to link a script to the name  <b>-i</b>. When it is called by a sequence such as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>sh -</b><br/>

or by:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>#! usr/bin/sh -</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
the historical systems have assumed that no option letters follow. Thus, this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 allows the single hyphen to mark the end of the options, in addition to the use of the regular  <b>&quot;--&quot;</b> argument, because it was considered that the older practice was so pervasive. An alternative approach is taken by the KornShell, where real and effective user/group IDs must match for an interactive shell; this behavior is specifically allowed by this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001.<dl>

There are other problems with set-user-ID scripts that the two approaches described here do not resolve.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The initialization process for the history file can be dependent on the system start-up files, in that they may contain commands that effectively preempt the user's settings of  <i>HISTFILE</i> and  <i>HISTSIZE</i>.  For example, function definition commands are recorded in the history file, unless the  <i>set</i> <b>-o</b> <i>nolog</i> option is set. If the system administrator includes function definitions in some system start-up file called before the  <i>ENV</i> file, the history file is initialized before the user gets a chance to influence its characteristics. In some historical shells, the history file is initialized just after the  <i>ENV</i> file has been processed. Therefore, it is implementation-defined whether changes made to  <i>HISTFILE</i> after the history file has been initialized are effective.<div class="spacer">

The default messages for the various <i>MAIL -related</i> messages are unspecified because they vary across implementations. Typical messages are:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">

It is important that the descriptions of command line editing refer to the same shell as that in IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 so that interactive users can also be application programmers without having to deal with programmatic differences in their two environments. It is also essential that the utility name  <i>sh</i> be specified because this explicit utility name is too firmly rooted in historical practice of application programs for it to change.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Consideration was given to mandating a diagnostic message when attempting to set  <i>vi</i>-mode on terminals that do not support command line editing. However, it is not historical practice for the shell to be cognizant of all terminal types and thus be able to detect inappropriate terminals in all cases. Implementations are encouraged to supply diagnostics in this case whenever possible, rather than leaving the user in a state where editing commands work incorrectly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In early proposals, the KornShell-derived <i>emacs</i> mode of command line editing was included, even though the  <i>emacs</i> editor itself was not. The community of  <i>emacs</i> proponents was adamant that the full  <i>emacs</i> editor not be standardized because they were concerned that an attempt to standardize this very powerful environment would encourage vendors to ship strictly conforming versions lacking the extensibility required by the community. The author of the original  <i>emacs</i> program also expressed his desire to omit the program. Furthermore, there were a number of historical systems that did not include  <i>emacs</i>, or included it without supporting it, but there were very few that did not include and support  <i>vi</i>. The shell <i>emacs</i> command line editing mode was finally omitted because it became apparent that the KornShell version and the editor being distributed with the GNU system had diverged in some respects. The author of  <i>emacs</i> requested that the POSIX <i>emacs</i> mode either be deleted or have a significant number of unspecified conditions. Although the KornShell author agreed to consider changes to bring the shell into alignment, the standard developers decided to defer specification at that time. At the time, it was assumed that convergence on an acceptable definition would occur for a subsequent draft, but that has not happened, and there appears to be no impetus to do so. In any case, implementations are free to offer additional command line editing modes based on the exact models of editors their users are most comfortable with.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Early proposals had the following list entry in vi Line Editing Insert Mode :<dl>
<dt>
<b>\</b></dt>
<dd>
If followed by the <i>erase</i> or <i>kill</i> character, that character shall be inserted into the input line. Otherwise, the backslash itself shall be inserted into the input line.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, this is not actually a feature of <i>sh</i> command line editing insert mode, but one of some historical terminal line drivers. Some conforming implementations continue to do this when the  <i>stty</i>  <b>iexten</b> flag is set.</div>
