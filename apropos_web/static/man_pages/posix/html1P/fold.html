fold - filter for folding lines
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>fold</B> <B>[</B><B>-bs</B><B>][</B><B>-w</B> <I>width</I><B>][</B><I>file</I><B>...</B><B>]</B>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>fold</I> utility is a filter that shall fold lines from its
input files, breaking the lines to have a maximum of
<I>width</I> column positions (or bytes, if the <B>-b</B> option is
specified). Lines shall be broken by the insertion of a
&lt;newline&gt; such that each output line (referred to later in this section
as a <I>segment</I>) is the maximum width possible
that does not exceed the specified number of column positions (or
bytes). A line shall not be broken in the middle of a character.
The behavior is undefined if <I>width</I> is less than the number of
columns any single character in the input would occupy.
<P>

If the &lt;carriage-return&gt;s, &lt;backspace&gt;s, or &lt;tab&gt;s are encountered
in the input, and the <B>-b</B> option is
not specified, they shall be treated specially:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&lt;backspace&gt;<DD>
The current count of line width shall be decremented by one, although
the count never shall become negative. The <I>fold</I>
utility shall not insert a &lt;newline&gt; immediately before or after any
&lt;backspace&gt;.
<DT>&lt;carriage-return&gt;<DD>
<P>
The current count of line width shall be set to zero. The <I>fold</I>
utility shall not insert a &lt;newline&gt; immediately before
or after any &lt;carriage-return&gt;.
<DT>&lt;tab&gt;<DD>
Each &lt;tab&gt; encountered shall advance the column position pointer to
the next tab stop. Tab stops shall be at each column
position <I>n</I> such that <I>n</I> modulo 8 equals 1.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The <I>fold</I> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
<P>

The following options shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-b</B><DD>
Count <I>width</I> in bytes rather than column positions.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
If a segment of a line contains a &lt;blank&gt; within the first <I>width</I>
column positions (or bytes), break the line after
the last such &lt;blank&gt; meeting the width constraints. If there is no
&lt;blank&gt; meeting the requirements, the <B>-s</B>
option shall have no effect for that output segment of the input line.
<DT><B>-w&nbsp;</B> <I>width</I><DD>
Specify the maximum line length, in column positions (or bytes if
<B>-b</B> is specified). The results are unspecified if
<I>width</I> is not a positive decimal number. The default value shall
be 80.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPERANDS</H2>

<P>

The following operand shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>file</I><DD>
A pathname of a text file to be folded. If no <I>file</I> operands
are specified, the standard input shall be used.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDIN</H2>

<P>

The standard input shall be used only if no <I>file</I> operands are
specified. See the INPUT FILES section.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

If the <B>-b</B> option is specified, the input files shall be text
files except that the lines are not limited to {LINE_MAX}
bytes in length. If the <B>-b</B> option is not specified, the input
files shall be text files.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<P>

The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
<I>fold</I>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>LANG</I><DD>
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
<DT><I>LC_ALL</I><DD>
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
<DT><I>LC_CTYPE</I><DD>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files), and
for the determination of the width in column positions each
character would occupy on a constant-width font output device.
<DT><I>LC_MESSAGES</I><DD>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
<DT><I>NLSPATH</I><DD>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <I>LC_MESSAGES
.</I>

Default.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDOUT</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXIT STATUS</H2>

<P>

The following exit values shall be returned:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&nbsp;0<DD>

<DT>&gt;0<DD>
An error occurred.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</H2>

<P>

Default.
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

The <I>cut</I> and <I>fold</I> utilities can be used to create text
files out of files with
arbitrary line lengths. The <I>cut</I> utility should be used when
the number of lines (or
records) needs to remain constant. The <I>fold</I> utility should be
used when the contents of long lines need to be kept
contiguous.
<P>

The <I>fold</I> utility is frequently used to send text files to printers
that truncate, rather than fold, lines wider than the
printer is able to print (usually 80 or 132 column positions).
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

An example invocation that submits a file of possibly long lines to
the printer (under the assumption that the user knows the
line width of the printer to be assigned by <I>lp</I>):
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>fold -w 132 bigfile | lp
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

Although terminal input in canonical processing mode requires the
erase character (frequently set to &lt;backspace&gt;) to erase
the previous character (not byte or column position), terminal output
is not buffered and is extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to parse correctly; the interpretation depends entirely
on the physical device that actually displays/prints/stores the
output. In all known internationalized implementations, the utilities
producing output for mixed column-width output assume that a
&lt;backspace&gt; backs up one column position and outputs enough &lt;backspace&gt;s
to return to the start of the character when
&lt;backspace&gt; is used to provide local line motions to support underlining
and emboldening operations. Since <I>fold</I>
without the <B>-b</B> option is dealing with these same constraints,
&lt;backspace&gt; is always treated as backing up one column
position rather than backing up one character.
<P>

Historical versions of the <I>fold</I> utility assumed 1 byte was one
character and occupied one column position when written
out. This is no longer always true. Since the most common usage of
<I>fold</I> is believed to be folding long lines for output to
limited-length output devices, this capability was preserved as the
default case. The <B>-b</B> option was added so that
applications could <I>fold</I> files with arbitrary length lines into
text files that could then be processed by the standard
utilities. Note that although the width for the <B>-b</B> option is
in bytes, a line is never split in the middle of a character.
(It is unspecified what happens if a width is specified that is too
small to hold a single character found in the input followed by
a &lt;newline&gt;.)
<P>

The tab stops are hardcoded to be every eighth column to meet historical
practice. No new method of specifying other tab stops
was invented.

<H2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>

<P>

None.
