<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>xargs</I> utility shall construct a command line consisting
of the <I>utility</I> and <I>argument</I> operands specified
followed by as many arguments read in sequence from standard input
as fit in length and number constraints specified by the
options. The <I>xargs</I> utility shall then invoke the constructed
command line and wait for its completion. This sequence shall
be repeated until one of the following occurs:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
An end-of-file condition is detected on standard input.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The logical end-of-file string (see the <B>-E</B> <I>eofstr</I> option)
is found on standard input after double-quote
processing, apostrophe processing, and backslash escape processing
(see next paragraph).
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
An invocation of a constructed command line returns an exit status
of 255.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The application shall ensure that arguments in the standard input
are separated by unquoted &lt;blank&gt;s, unescaped
&lt;blank&gt;s, or &lt;newline&gt;s. A string of zero or more non-double-quote
( <B>' )'</B> characters and non- &lt;newline&gt;s
can be quoted by enclosing them in double-quotes. A string of zero
or more non-apostrophe ( <B>'&quot;</B> ) characters and non-
&lt;newline&gt;s can be quoted by enclosing them in apostrophes. Any unquoted
character can be escaped by preceding it with a
backslash. The utility named by <I>utility</I> shall be executed one
or more times until the end-of-file is reached or the logical
end-of file string is found. The results are unspecified if the utility
named by <I>utility</I> attempts to read from its standard
input.
<P>

The generated command line length shall be the sum of the size in
bytes of the utility name and each argument treated as
strings, including a null byte terminator for each of these strings.
The <I>xargs</I> utility shall limit the command line length
such that when the command line is invoked, the combined argument
and environment lists (see the <I>exec</I> family of functions in
the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001) shall not
exceed {ARG_MAX}-2048 bytes. Within this constraint, if
neither the <B>-n</B> nor the <B>-s</B> option is specified, the default
command line length shall be at least {LINE_MAX}.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The <I>xargs</I> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
<P>

The following options shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-E&nbsp;</B> <I>eofstr</I><DD>
Use <I>eofstr</I> as the logical end-of-file string. If <B>-E</B> is
not specified, it is unspecified whether the logical
end-of-file string is the underscore character ( <B>'_'</B> ) or the
end-of-file string capability is disabled. When
<I>eofstr</I> is the null string, the logical end-of-file string capability
shall be disabled and underscore characters shall be
taken literally.
<DT><B>-I&nbsp;</B> <I>replstr</I><DD>
Insert mode: <I>utility</I> is executed for each line from standard
input, taking the entire line as a single argument, inserting
it in <I>argument</I>s for each occurrence of <I>replstr</I>. A maximum
of five arguments in <I>argument</I>s can each contain one
or more instances of <I>replstr</I>. Any &lt;blank&gt;s at the beginning
of each line shall be ignored. Constructed arguments
cannot grow larger than 255 bytes. Option <B>-x</B> shall be forced
on. 
<DT><B>-L&nbsp;</B> <I>number</I><DD>
The <I>utility</I> shall be executed for each non-empty <I>number</I>
lines of arguments from standard input. The last invocation
of <I>utility</I> shall be with fewer lines of arguments if fewer than
<I>number</I> remain. A line is considered to end with the
first &lt;newline&gt; unless the last character of the line is a &lt;blank&gt;;
a trailing &lt;blank&gt; signals continuation to
the next non-empty line, inclusive. The <B>-L</B> and <B>-n</B> options
are mutually-exclusive; the last one specified shall take
effect. 
<DT><B>-n&nbsp;</B> <I>number</I><DD>
Invoke <I>utility</I> using as many standard input arguments as possible,
up to <I>number</I> (a positive decimal integer)
arguments maximum. Fewer arguments shall be used if: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The command line length accumulated exceeds the size specified by
the <B>-s</B> option (or {LINE_MAX} if there is no <B>-s</B>
option).
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The last iteration has fewer than <I>number</I>, but not zero, operands
remaining.
</DL>
<P>

</DL>

<DT><B>-p</B><DD>
Prompt mode: the user is asked whether to execute <I>utility</I> at
each invocation. Trace mode ( <B>-t</B>) is turned on to
write the command instance to be executed, followed by a prompt to
standard error. An affirmative response read from
<B>/dev/tty</B> shall execute the command; otherwise, that particular
invocation of <I>utility</I> shall be skipped.
<DT><B>-s&nbsp;</B> <I>size</I><DD>
Invoke <I>utility</I> using as many standard input arguments as possible
yielding a command line length less than <I>size</I>
(a positive decimal integer) bytes. Fewer arguments shall be used
if: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The total number of arguments exceeds that specified by the <B>-n</B>
option.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The total number of lines exceeds that specified by the <B>-L</B> option.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
End-of-file is encountered on standard input before <I>size</I> bytes
are accumulated.
</DL>
<P>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

Values of <I>size</I> up to at least {LINE_MAX} bytes shall be supported,
provided that the constraints specified in the
DESCRIPTION are met. It shall not be considered an error if a value
larger than that supported by the implementation or exceeding
the constraints specified in the DESCRIPTION is given; <I>xargs</I>
shall use the largest value it supports within the
constraints.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-t</B><DD>
Enable trace mode. Each generated command line shall be written to
standard error just prior to invocation.
<DT><B>-x</B><DD>
Terminate if a command line containing <I>number</I> arguments (see
the <B>-n</B> option above)  or
<I>number</I> lines (see the <B>-L</B> option above)  will not fit
in the implied or specified size (see the <B>-s</B> option above).
<P>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPERANDS</H2>

<P>

The following operands shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>

the <I>PATH</I> environment variable, described in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment
Variables.
If <I>utility</I> is omitted, the default shall be the <I>echo</I> utility.

The following exit values shall be returned:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<DD>
All invocations of <I>utility</I> returned exit status zero.
<DT>1-125<DD>
A command line meeting the specified requirements could not be assembled,
one or more of the invocations of <I>utility</I>
returned a non-zero exit status, or some other error occurred.
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;126<DD>
The utility specified by <I>utility</I> was found but could not be
invoked.
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;127<DD>
The utility specified by <I>utility</I> could not be found.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</H2>

<P>

If a command line meeting the specified requirements cannot be assembled,
the utility cannot be invoked, an invocation of the
utility is terminated by a signal, or an invocation of the utility
exits with exit status 255, the <I>xargs</I> utility shall write
a diagnostic message and exit without processing any remaining input.
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

The 255 exit status allows a utility being used by <I>xargs</I> to
tell <I>xargs</I> to terminate if it knows no further
invocations using the current data stream will succeed. Thus, <I>utility</I>
should explicitly <I>exit</I> with an appropriate value to avoid accidentally
returning with 255.
<P>

Note that input is parsed as lines; &lt;blank&gt;s separate arguments. If
<I>xargs</I> is used to bundle output of commands like
<I>find</I> <I>dir</I> <B>-print</B> or <I>ls</I> into
commands to be executed, unexpected results are likely if any filenames
contain any &lt;blank&gt;s or &lt;newline&gt;s. This can be
fixed by using <I>find</I> to call a script that converts each file
found into a quoted string
that is then piped to <I>xargs</I>. Note that the quoting rules used
by <I>xargs</I> are not the same as in the shell. They were
not made consistent here because existing applications depend on the
current rules and the shell syntax is not fully compatible
with it. An easy rule that can be used to transform any string into
a quoted form that <I>xargs</I> interprets correctly is to
precede each character in the string with a backslash.
<P>

On implementations with a large value for {ARG_MAX}, <I>xargs</I> may
produce command lines longer than {LINE_MAX}. For
invocation of utilities, this is not a problem. If <I>xargs</I> is
being used to create a text file, users should explicitly set
the maximum command line length with the <B>-s</B> option.
<P>

The <I>command</I>, <I>env</I>, <I>nice</I>, <I>nohup</I>, <I>time</I>,
and <I>xargs</I> utilities have been specified to use exit code 127
if an error occurs so
that applications can distinguish &quot;failure to find a utility&quot; from
&quot;invoked utility exited with an error indication&quot;. The value
127 was chosen because it is not commonly used for other meanings;
most utilities use small values for &quot;normal error conditions''
and the values above 128 can be confused with termination due to receipt
of a signal. The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner
to indicate that the utility could be found, but not invoked. Some
scripts produce meaningful error messages differentiating the
126 and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes 126 and 127
is based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all attempts to
<I>exec</I> the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses 126 when any attempt
to <I>exec</I> the utility fails for any other
reason.

</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

The <I>xargs</I> utility was usually found only in System V-based systems;
BSD systems included an <I>apply</I> utility that
provided functionality similar to <I>xargs</I> <B>-n</B> <I>number</I>.
The SVID lists <I>xargs</I> as a software development
extension. This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not share the
view that it is used only for development, and
therefore it is not optional.
<P>

The classic application of the <I>xargs</I> utility is in conjunction
with the <I>find</I>
utility to reduce the number of processes launched by a simplistic
use of the <I>find</I>
<B>-exec</B> combination. The <I>xargs</I> utility is also used to enforce
an upper limit on memory required to launch a process.
With this basis in mind, this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 selected
only the minimal features required.
<P>

Although the 255 exit status is mostly an accident of historical implementations,
it allows a utility being used by <I>xargs</I>
to tell <I>xargs</I> to terminate if it knows no further invocations
using the current data stream shall succeed. Any non-zero exit
status from a utility falls into the 1-125 range when <I>xargs</I>
exits. There is no statement of how the various non-zero utility
exit status codes are accumulated by <I>xargs</I>. The value could
be the addition of all codes, their highest value, the last one
received, or a single value such as 1. Since no algorithm is arguably
better than the others, and since many of the standard
utilities say little more (portably) than &quot;pass/fail&quot;, no new algorithm
was invented.
<P>

Several other <I>xargs</I> options were withdrawn because simple alternatives
already exist within this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. For example, the <B>-i</B> <I>replstr</I> option
can be just as efficiently performed using a shell
<B>for</B> loop. Since <I>xargs</I> calls an <I>exec</I> function with
each input line, the <B>-i</B> option does not usually
exploit the grouping capabilities of <I>xargs</I>.
<P>

The requirement that <I>xargs</I> never produces command lines such
that invocation of <I>utility</I> is within 2048 bytes of
hitting the POSIX <I>exec</I> {ARG_MAX} limitations is intended to
guarantee that the invoked utility has room to modify its
environment variables and command line arguments and still be able
to invoke another utility. Note that the minimum {ARG_MAX}
allowed by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
is 4096 bytes and the minimum value allowed by this
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is 2048 bytes; therefore, the 2048
bytes difference seems reasonable. Note, however, that
<I>xargs</I> may never be able to invoke a utility if the environment
passed in to <I>xargs</I> comes close to using {ARG_MAX}
bytes.
<P>

The version of <I>xargs</I> required by this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
is required to wait for the completion of
the invoked command before invoking another command. This was done
because historical scripts using <I>xargs</I> assumed sequential
execution. Implementations wanting to provide parallel operation of
the invoked utilities are encouraged to add an option enabling
parallel invocation, but should still wait for termination of all
of the children before <I>xargs</I> terminates normally.
<P>

The <B>-e</B> option was omitted from the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2:1993 standard
in the belief that the <I>eofstr</I> option-argument
was recognized only when it was on a line by itself and before quote
and escape processing were performed, and that the logical
end-of-file processing was only enabled if a <B>-e</B> option was specified.
In that case, a simple <I>sed</I> script could be used to duplicate
the <B>-e</B> functionality. Further investigation
revealed that:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The logical end-of-file string was checked for after quote and escape
processing, making a <I>sed</I> script that provided equivalent functionality
much more difficult to write.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The default was to perform logical end-of-file processing with an
underscore as the logical end-of-file string.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

To correct this misunderstanding, the <B>-E</B> <I>eofstr</I> option
was adopted from the X/Open Portability Guide. Users should
note that the description of the <B>-E</B> option matches historical
documentation of the <B>-e</B> option (which was not adopted
because it did not support the Utility Syntax Guidelines), by saying
that if <I>eofstr</I> is the null string, logical end-of-file
processing is disabled. Historical implementations of <I>xargs</I>
actually did not disable logical end-of-file processing; they
treated a null argument found in the input as a logical end-of-file
string. (A null <I>string</I> argument could be generated using
single or double quotes ( <B>''</B> or <B>&quot;&quot;</B> ). Since this behavior
was not documented historically, it is considered to be
a bug.
