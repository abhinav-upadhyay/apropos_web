<h1>NAME</h1> find - find files</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>  <b>find</b> <b>[</b><b>-H | -L</b><b>]</b> <i>path</i> <b>...</b> <b>[</b><i>operand_expression</i>  <b>...</b><b>]</b></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>find</i> utility shall recursively descend the directory hierarchy from each file specified by  <i>path</i>, evaluating a Boolean expression composed of the primaries described in the OPERANDS section for each file encountered.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>find</i> utility shall be able to descend to arbitrary depths in a file hierarchy and shall not fail due to path length limitations (unless a  <i>path</i> operand specified by the application exceeds {PATH_MAX} requirements).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>find</i> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file encountered. When it detects an infinite loop,  <i>find</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover its position in the hierarchy or terminate.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> The  <i>find</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following options shall be supported by the implementation:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-H</b></dt>
<dd>
Cause the file information and file type evaluated for each symbolic link encountered on the command line to be those of the file referenced by the link, and not the link itself. If the referenced file does not exist, the file information and type shall be for the link itself. File information for all symbolic links not on the command line shall be that of the link itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-L</b></dt>
<dd>
Cause the file information and file type evaluated for each symbolic link to be those of the file referenced by the link, and not the link itself.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options <b>-H</b> and  <b>-L</b> shall not be considered an error. The last option specified shall determine the behavior of the utility.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPERANDS</h1> The following operands shall be supported:<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>path</i> operand is a pathname of a starting point in the directory hierarchy.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first argument that starts with a <b>'-'</b>, or is a <b>'!'</b> or a  <b>'('</b>, and all subsequent arguments shall be interpreted as an  <i>expression</i> made up of the following primaries and operators. In the descriptions, wherever  <i>n</i> is used as a primary argument, it shall be interpreted as a decimal integer optionally preceded by a plus (  <b>'+'</b> ) or minus (  <b>'-'</b> ) sign, as follows:<dl>
<dt>
+<i>n</i></dt>
<dd>
More than <i>n</i>.</dd>

The following primaries shall be supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-name&#160;</b> <i>pattern</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The primary shall evaluate as true if the basename of the filename being examined matches  <i>pattern</i> using the pattern matching notation described in  <i>Pattern Matching Notation</i> .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-nouser</b></dt>
<dd>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to a user ID for which the  <i>getpwuid</i>() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 (or equivalent) returns NULL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-nogroup</b></dt>

The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to a group ID for which the  <i>getgrgid</i>() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 (or equivalent) returns NULL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-xdev</b></dt>
<dd>
The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause <i>find</i> not to continue descending past directories that have a different device ID (  <i>st_dev</i>, see the <i>stat</i>() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001). If any  <b>-xdev</b> primary is specified, it shall apply to the entire expression even if the  <b>-xdev</b> primary would not normally be evaluated.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>-prune</b></dt>

The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause <i>find</i> not to descend the current pathname if it is a directory. If the  <b>-depth</b> primary is specified, the <b>-prune</b> primary shall have no effect.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>-perm&#160;[-]</b><i>mode</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <i>mode</i> argument is used to represent file mode bits. It shall be identical in format to the  <i>symbolic_mode</i> operand described in  <i>chmod</i>(), and shall be interpreted as follows. To start, a template shall be assumed with all file mode bits cleared. An  <i>op</i> symbol of <b>'+'</b> shall set the appropriate mode bits in the template;  <b>'-'</b> shall clear the appropriate bits; <b>'='</b> shall set the appropriate mode bits, without regard to the contents of process' file mode creation mask. The  <i>op</i> symbol of <b>'-'</b> cannot be the first character of  <i>mode</i>; this avoids ambiguity with the optional leading hyphen. Since the initial mode is all bits off, there are not any symbolic modes that need to use  <b>'-'</b> as the first character.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the hyphen is omitted, the primary shall evaluate as true when the file permission bits exactly match the value of the resulting template.<div class="spacer">

<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the hyphen is omitted, the primary shall evaluate as true when the file permission bits exactly match the value of the octal number  <i>onum</i> and only the bits corresponding to the octal mask 07777 shall be compared. (See the description of the octal  <i>mode</i> in <i>chmod</i>().) Otherwise, if <i>onum</i> is prefixed by a hyphen, the primary shall evaluate as true if at least all of the bits specified in  <i>onum</i> that are also set in the octal mask 07777 are set.</dd>

The end of the primary expression shall be punctuated by a semicolon or by a plus sign. Only a plus sign that follows an argument containing the two characters  <b>&quot;{}&quot;</b> shall punctuate the end of the primary expression. Other uses of the plus sign shall not be treated as special.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the primary expression is punctuated by a semicolon, the utility  <i>utility_name</i> shall be invoked once for each pathname and the primary shall evaluate as true if the utility returns a zero value as exit status. A  <i>utility_name</i> or <i>argument</i> containing only the two characters  <b>&quot;{}&quot;</b> shall be replaced by the current pathname.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the primary expression is punctuated by a plus sign, the primary shall always evaluate as true, and the pathnames for which the primary is evaluated shall be aggregated into sets. The utility  <i>utility_name</i> shall be invoked once for each set of aggregated pathnames. Each invocation shall begin after the last pathname in the set is aggregated, and shall be completed before the  <i>find</i> utility exits and before the first pathname in the next set (if any) is aggregated for this primary, but it is otherwise unspecified whether the invocation occurs before, during, or after the evaluations of other primaries. If any invocation returns a non-zero value as exit status, the  <i>find</i> utility shall return a non-zero exit status. An argument containing only the two characters  <b>&quot;{}&quot;</b> shall be replaced by the set of aggregated pathnames, with each pathname passed as a separate argument to the invoked utility in the same order that it was aggregated. The size of any set of two or more pathnames shall be limited such that execution of the utility does not cause the system's {ARG_MAX} limit to be exceeded. If more than one argument containing only the two characters  <b>&quot;{}&quot;</b> is present, the behavior is unspecified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a <i>utility_name</i> or <i>argument</i> string contains the two characters  <b>&quot;{}&quot;</b>, but not just the two characters  <b>&quot;{}&quot;</b>, it is implementation-defined whether <i>find</i> replaces those two characters or uses the string without change. The current directory for the invocation of  <i>utility_name</i> shall be the same as the current directory when the  <i>find</i> utility was started. If the  <i>utility_name</i> names any of the special built-in utilities (see  <i>Special Built-In Utilities</i> ), the results are undefined.<dl>

The <b>-ok</b> primary shall be equivalent to <b>-exec</b>, except that the use of a plus sign to punctuate the end of the primary expression need not be supported, and  <i>find</i> shall request affirmation of the invocation of  <i>utility_name</i> using the current file as an argument by writing to standard error as described in the STDERR section. If the response on standard input is affirmative, the utility shall be invoked. Otherwise, the command shall not be invoked and the value of the  <b>-ok</b> operand shall be false.</dd>

The descriptions of the <b>'-'</b> modifier on the <i>mode</i> and <i>onum</i> arguments to the  <b>-perm</b> primary agree with historical practice on BSD and System V implementations.

 *</dt>
<dd>
Implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than those used on historical implementations.</dd>

<dd>
Since the historical prompt strings do not terminate with &lt;newline&gt;s, there is no portable way for another program to interact with the prompts of this utility via pipes.</dd>

<div class="spacer">
</div>
Therefore, an application using this prompting option relies on the system to provide the most suitable dialog directly with the user, based on the general guidelines specified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-name</b> <i>file</i> operand was changed to use the shell pattern matching notation so that  <i>find</i> is consistent with other utilities using pattern matching.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-size</b> operand refers to the size of a file, rather than the number of blocks it may occupy in the file system. The intent is that the  <i>st_size</i> field defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 should be used, not the  <i>st_blocks</i> found in historical implementations.

In both System V and BSD, <i>find</i> only uses <i>st_size</i> in size calculations for the operands specified by this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001. (BSD uses  <i>st_blocks</i> only when processing the  <b>-ls</b> primary.)</dd>

Users usually think of file size in terms of bytes, which is also the unit used by the  <i>ls</i> utility for the output from the <b>-l</b> option. (In both System V and BSD,  <i>ls</i> uses <i>st_size</i> for the  <b>-l</b> option size field and uses <i>st_blocks</i> for the <i>ls</i>  <b>-s</b> calculations. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 does not specify  <i>ls</i> <b>-s</b>.)</dd>

The descriptions of <b>-atime</b>, <b>-ctime</b>, and <b>-mtime</b> were changed from the SVID description of  <i>n</i> &quot;days'' to &quot;24-hour periods&quot;. The description is also different in terms of the exact timeframe for the  <i>n</i> case (<i>versus</i> the  <i>+n</i> or <i>-n</i>), but it matches all known historical implementations. It refers to one 86400 second period in the past, not any time from the beginning of that period to the current time. For example,  <b>-atime</b> 3 is true if the file was accessed any time in the period from 72 hours to 48 hours ago.<div class="spacer">

Historical implementations do not modify <b>&quot;{}&quot;</b> when it appears as a substring of an  <b>-exec</b> or <b>-ok</b>  <i>utility_name</i> or argument string. There have been numerous user requests for this extension, so this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 allows the desired behavior. At least one recent implementation does support this feature, but encountered several problems in managing memory allocation and dealing with multiple occurrences of  <b>&quot;{}&quot;</b> in a string while it was being developed, so it is not yet required behavior.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Assuming the presence of <b>-print</b> was added to correct a historical pitfall that plagues novice users, it is entirely upwards-compatible from the historical System V  <i>find</i> utility. In its simplest form (  <i>find</i> <i>directory</i>), it could be confused with the historical BSD fast  <i>find</i>. The BSD developers agreed that adding  <b>-print</b> as a default expression was the correct decision and have added the fast  <i>find</i> functionality within a new utility called  <i>locate</i>.<div class="spacer">

Historically, the <b>-L</b> option was implemented using the primary  <b>-follow</b>. The <b>-H</b> and <b>-L</b> options were added for two reasons. First, they offer a finer granularity of control and consistency with other programs that walk file hierarchies. Second, the  <b>-follow</b> primary always evaluated to true. As they were historically really global variables that took effect before the traversal began, some valid expressions had unexpected results. An example is the expression  <b>-print</b>  <b>-o</b> <b>-follow</b>. Because <b>-print</b> always evaluates to true, the standard order of evaluation implies that  <b>-follow</b> would never be evaluated. This was never the case. Historical practice for the  <b>-follow</b> primary, however, is not consistent. Some implementations always follow symbolic links on the command line whether  <b>-follow</b> is specified or not. Others follow symbolic links on the command line only if  <b>-follow</b> is specified. Both behaviors are provided by the  <b>-H</b> and  <b>-L</b> options, but scripts using the current <b>-follow</b> primary would be broken if the  <b>-follow</b> option is specified to work either way.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since the <b>-L</b> option resolves all symbolic links and the <b>-type</b>  <i>l</i> primary is true for symbolic links that still exist after symbolic links have been resolved, the command:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>find -L . -type l</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
prints a list of symbolic links reachable from the current directory that do not resolve to accessible files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A feature of SVR4's <i>find</i> utility was the <b>-exec</b> primary's  <b>+</b> terminator. This allowed filenames containing special characters (especially &lt;newline&gt;s) to be grouped together without the problems that occur if such filenames are piped to  <i>xargs</i>. Other implementations have added other ways to get around this problem, notably a  <b>-print0</b> primary that wrote filenames with a null byte terminator. This was considered here, but not adopted. Using a null terminator meant that any utility that was going to process  <i>find</i>'s <b>-print0</b> output had to add a new option to parse the null terminators it would now be reading.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>&quot;-exec ... {} +&quot;</b> syntax adopted was a result of IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.2 #210. It should be noted that this is an incompatible change to the ISO/IEC&#160;9899:1999 standard. For example, the following command prints all files with a  <b>'-'</b> after their name if they are regular files, and a <b>'+'</b> otherwise:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>find / -type f -exec echo {} - ';' -o -exec echo {} + ';'</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The change invalidates usage like this. Even though the previous standard stated that this usage would work, in practice many did not support it and the standard developers felt it better to now state that this was not allowable.</div>
