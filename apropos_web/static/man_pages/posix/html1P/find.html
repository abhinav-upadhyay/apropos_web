find - find files
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>find</B> <B>[</B><B>-H | -L</B><B>]</B> <I>path</I> <B>...</B> <B>[</B><I>operand_expression</I>
<B>...</B><B>]</B>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>find</I> utility shall recursively descend the directory hierarchy
from each file specified by <I>path</I>, evaluating a
Boolean expression composed of the primaries described in the OPERANDS
section for each file encountered.
<P>

The <I>find</I> utility shall be able to descend to arbitrary depths
in a file hierarchy and shall not fail due to path length
limitations (unless a <I>path</I> operand specified by the application
exceeds {PATH_MAX} requirements).
<P>

The <I>find</I> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering
a previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the
last file encountered. When it detects an infinite loop, <I>find</I>
shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and shall
either recover its position in the hierarchy or terminate.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The <I>find</I> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
<P>

The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-H</B><DD>
Cause the file information and file type evaluated for each symbolic
link encountered on the command line to be those of the
file referenced by the link, and not the link itself. If the referenced
file does not exist, the file information and type shall be
for the link itself. File information for all symbolic links not on
the command line shall be that of the link itself.
<DT><B>-L</B><DD>
Cause the file information and file type evaluated for each symbolic
link to be those of the file referenced by the link, and
not the link itself.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options <B>-H</B>
and <B>-L</B> shall not be considered an error. The last
option specified shall determine the behavior of the utility.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPERANDS</H2>

<P>

The following operands shall be supported:
<P>

The <I>path</I> operand is a pathname of a starting point in the directory
hierarchy.
<P>

The first argument that starts with a <B>'-'</B>, or is a <B>'!'</B>
or a <B>'('</B>, and all subsequent arguments shall
be interpreted as an <I>expression</I> made up of the following primaries
and operators. In the descriptions, wherever <I>n</I> is
used as a primary argument, it shall be interpreted as a decimal integer
optionally preceded by a plus ( <B>'+'</B> ) or minus (
<B>'-'</B> ) sign, as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>+<I>n</I><DD>
More than <I>n</I>.
<DT><I>n</I><DD>
Exactly <I>n</I>.
<DT>-<I>n</I><DD>
Less than <I>n</I>.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The following primaries shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-name&nbsp;</B> <I>pattern</I><DD>
<P>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the basename of the filename
being examined matches <I>pattern</I> using the pattern matching
notation described in <I>Pattern Matching Notation</I> .
<DT><B>-nouser</B><DD>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to a user ID
for which the <I>getpwuid</I>() function defined in the System Interfaces
volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 (or equivalent) returns NULL.
<DT><B>-nogroup</B><DD>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to a group
ID for which the <I>getgrgid</I>() function defined in the System Interfaces
volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 (or equivalent) returns NULL.
<DT><B>-xdev</B><DD>
The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause <I>find</I>
not to continue descending past directories that have a
different device ID ( <I>st_dev</I>, see the <I>stat</I>() function
defined in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001). If any <B>-xdev</B> primary
is specified, it shall apply to the entire
expression even if the <B>-xdev</B> primary would not normally be evaluated.
<DT><B>-prune</B><DD>
The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause <I>find</I>
not to descend the current pathname if it is a directory.
If the <B>-depth</B> primary is specified, the <B>-prune</B> primary
shall have no effect.
<DT><B>-perm&nbsp;[-]</B><I>mode</I><DD>
<P>
The <I>mode</I> argument is used to represent file mode bits. It shall
be identical in format to the <I>symbolic_mode</I> operand
described in <I>chmod</I>(), and shall be interpreted as follows.
To start, a template shall be assumed
with all file mode bits cleared. An <I>op</I> symbol of <B>'+'</B> shall
set the appropriate mode bits in the template;
<B>'-'</B> shall clear the appropriate bits; <B>'='</B> shall set the
appropriate mode bits, without regard to the contents of
process' file mode creation mask. The <I>op</I> symbol of <B>'-'</B>
cannot be the first character of <I>mode</I>; this avoids
ambiguity with the optional leading hyphen. Since the initial mode
is all bits off, there are not any symbolic modes that need to
use <B>'-'</B> as the first character. 
</DL>
<P>

If the hyphen is omitted, the primary shall evaluate as true when
the file permission bits exactly match the value of the
resulting template.
<P>

Otherwise, if <I>mode</I> is prefixed by a hyphen, the primary shall
evaluate as true if at least all the bits in the resulting
template are set in the file permission bits.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-perm&nbsp;[-]</B><I>onum</I><DD>
<P>
If the hyphen is omitted, the primary shall evaluate as true when
the file permission bits exactly match the value of the octal
number <I>onum</I> and only the bits corresponding to the octal mask
07777 shall be compared. (See the description of the octal
<I>mode</I> in <I>chmod</I>().) Otherwise, if <I>onum</I> is prefixed
by a hyphen, the primary shall
evaluate as true if at least all of the bits specified in <I>onum</I>
that are also set in the octal mask 07777 are set.
<DT><B>-type&nbsp;</B> <I>c</I><DD>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the type of the file is <I>c</I>,
where <I>c</I> is <B>'b'</B>, <B>'c'</B>,
<B>'d'</B>, <B>'l'</B>, <B>'p'</B>, <B>'f'</B>, or <B>'s'</B> for block
special file, character special file,
directory, symbolic link, FIFO, regular file, or socket, respectively.
<DT><B>-links&nbsp;</B> <I>n</I><DD>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file has <I>n</I> links.
<DT><B>-user&nbsp;</B> <I>uname</I><DD>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to the user
<I>uname.</I> If <I>uname</I> is a decimal integer and the
<I>getpwnam</I>() (or equivalent) function does not return a valid
user name, <I>uname</I>
shall be interpreted as a user ID.
<DT><B>-group&nbsp;</B> <I>gname</I><DD>
<P>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to the group
<I>gname</I>. If <I>gname</I> is a decimal integer and the <I>getgrnam</I>()
(or equivalent) function does not return a valid group name, <I>gname</I>
shall be interpreted as a group ID.
<DT><B>-size&nbsp;</B> <I>n</I><B>[c]</B><DD>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file size in bytes, divided
by 512 and rounded up to the next integer, is <I>n</I>.
If <I>n</I> is followed by the character <B>'c'</B>, the size shall
be in bytes.
<DT><B>-atime&nbsp;</B> <I>n</I><DD>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file access time subtracted
from the initialization time, divided by 86400 (with any
remainder discarded), is <I>n</I>.
<DT><B>-ctime&nbsp;</B> <I>n</I><DD>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the time of last change of file
status information subtracted from the initialization
time, divided by 86400 (with any remainder discarded), is <I>n</I>.
<DT><B>-mtime&nbsp;</B> <I>n</I><DD>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file modification time subtracted
from the initialization time, divided by 86400
(with any remainder discarded), is <I>n</I>.
<DT><B>-exec&nbsp;</B> <I>utility_name&nbsp;</I> <B>[</B><I>argument</I>&nbsp;...<B>]&nbsp;;</B><DD>
<DT><B>-exec&nbsp;</B> <I>utility_name&nbsp;</I> <B>[</B><I>argument</I>&nbsp;...<B>]&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><DD>
{}&nbsp;+
<P>
The end of the primary expression shall be punctuated by a semicolon
or by a plus sign. Only a plus sign that follows an argument
containing the two characters <B>&quot;{}&quot;</B> shall punctuate the end of
the primary expression. Other uses of the plus sign shall
not be treated as special. 
</DL>
<P>

If the primary expression is punctuated by a semicolon, the utility
<I>utility_name</I> shall be invoked once for each pathname
and the primary shall evaluate as true if the utility returns a zero
value as exit status. A <I>utility_name</I> or <I>argument</I>
containing only the two characters <B>&quot;{}&quot;</B> shall be replaced by
the current pathname.
<P>

If the primary expression is punctuated by a plus sign, the primary
shall always evaluate as true, and the pathnames for which
the primary is evaluated shall be aggregated into sets. The utility
<I>utility_name</I> shall be invoked once for each set of
aggregated pathnames. Each invocation shall begin after the last pathname
in the set is aggregated, and shall be completed before
the <I>find</I> utility exits and before the first pathname in the
next set (if any) is aggregated for this primary, but it is
otherwise unspecified whether the invocation occurs before, during,
or after the evaluations of other primaries. If any invocation
returns a non-zero value as exit status, the <I>find</I> utility shall
return a non-zero exit status. An argument containing only
the two characters <B>&quot;{}&quot;</B> shall be replaced by the set of aggregated
pathnames, with each pathname passed as a separate
argument to the invoked utility in the same order that it was aggregated.
The size of any set of two or more pathnames shall be
limited such that execution of the utility does not cause the system's
{ARG_MAX} limit to be exceeded. If more than one argument
containing only the two characters <B>&quot;{}&quot;</B> is present, the behavior
is unspecified.
<P>

If a <I>utility_name</I> or <I>argument</I> string contains the two
characters <B>&quot;{}&quot;</B>, but not just the two characters
<B>&quot;{}&quot;</B>, it is implementation-defined whether <I>find</I> replaces
those two characters or uses the string without change.
The current directory for the invocation of <I>utility_name</I> shall
be the same as the current directory when the <I>find</I>
utility was started. If the <I>utility_name</I> names any of the special
built-in utilities (see <I>Special Built-In Utilities</I> ), the results
are undefined.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-ok&nbsp;</B> <I>utility_name&nbsp;</I> <B>[</B><I>argument</I>&nbsp;...<B>]&nbsp;;</B><DD>
<P>
The <B>-ok</B> primary shall be equivalent to <B>-exec</B>, except that
the use of a plus sign to punctuate the end of the primary
expression need not be supported, and <I>find</I> shall request affirmation
of the invocation of <I>utility_name</I> using the
current file as an argument by writing to standard error as described
in the STDERR section. If the response on standard input is
affirmative, the utility shall be invoked. Otherwise, the command
shall not be invoked and the value of the <B>-ok</B> operand
shall be false.
<DT><B>-print</B><DD>
The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause the current
pathname to be written to standard output.
<DT><B>-newer&nbsp;</B> <I>file</I><DD>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the modification time of the
current file is more recent than the modification time of
the file named by the pathname <I>file</I>.
<DT><B>-depth</B><DD>
The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause descent
of the directory hierarchy to be done so that all entries in
a directory are acted on before the directory itself. If a <B>-depth</B>
primary is not specified, all entries in a directory shall
be acted on after the directory itself. If any <B>-depth</B> primary
is specified, it shall apply to the entire expression even if
the <B>-depth</B> primary would not normally be evaluated.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The primaries can be combined using the following operators (in order
of decreasing precedence):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(&nbsp;<I>expression</I>&nbsp;)<DD>
True if <I>expression</I> is true.
<DT><B>!&nbsp;</B> <I>expression</I><DD>
Negation of a primary; the unary NOT operator.
<DT><I>expression&nbsp;</I> <B>[-a]&nbsp;</B> <I>expression</I><DD>
<P>
Conjunction of primaries; the AND operator is implied by the juxtaposition
of two primaries or made explicit by the optional
<B>-a</B> operator. The second expression shall not be evaluated if
the first expression is false.
<DT><I>expression&nbsp;</I> <B>-o&nbsp;</B> <I>expression</I><DD>
<P>
Alternation of primaries; the OR operator. The second expression shall
not be evaluated if the first expression is true.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

If no <I>expression</I> is present, <B>-print</B> shall be used as the
expression. Otherwise, if the given expression does not
contain any of the primaries <B>-exec</B>, <B>-ok</B>, or <B>-print</B>,
the given expression shall be effectively replaced by:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>(</B> <I>given_expression</I> <B>) -print
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The <B>-user</B>, <B>-group</B>, and <B>-newer</B> primaries each shall
evaluate their respective arguments only once.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDIN</H2>

<P>

If the <B>-ok</B> primary is used, the response shall be read from
the standard input. An entire line shall be read as the
response. Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<P>

The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
<I>find</I>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>LANG</I><DD>
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
<DT><I>LC_ALL</I><DD>
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
<DT><I>LC_COLLATE</I><DD>
<P>
Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges, equivalence classes,
and multi-character collating elements used in the pattern
matching notation for the <B>-n</B> option and in the extended regular
expression defined for the <B>yesexpr</B> locale keyword in
the <I>LC_MESSAGES</I> category.
<DT><I>LC_CTYPE</I><DD>
This variable determines the locale for the interpretation of sequences
of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments), the
behavior of character classes within the pattern matching
notation used for the <B>-n</B> option, and the behavior of character
classes within regular expressions used in the extended
regular expression defined for the <B>yesexpr</B> locale keyword in
the <I>LC_MESSAGES</I> category.
<DT><I>LC_MESSAGES</I><DD>
Determine the locale for the processing of affirmative responses that
should be used to affect the format and contents of
diagnostic messages written to standard error.
<DT><I>NLSPATH</I><DD>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <I>LC_MESSAGES
.</I> 
<DT><I>PATH</I><DD>
Determine the location of the <I>utility_name</I> for the <B>-exec</B>
and <B>-ok</B> primaries, as described in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment
Variables.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</H2>

<P>

Default.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDOUT</H2>

<P>

The <B>-print</B> primary shall cause the current pathnames to be written

current pathname. In the POSIX locale, the last non- &lt;blank&gt; in the
prompt shall be <B>'?'</B> . The exact format used is

<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

When used in operands, pattern matching notation, semicolons, opening
parentheses, and closing parentheses are special to the
shell and must be quoted (see <I>Quoting</I> ).
<P>

The bit that is traditionally used for sticky (historically 01000)
is specified in the <B>-perm</B> primary using the octal
number argument form. Since this bit is not defined by this volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, applications must not assume
that it actually refers to the traditional sticky bit.
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
The following commands are equivalent:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>find .
find . -print
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

They both write out the entire directory hierarchy from the current
directory.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
The following command:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>find / \( -name tmp -o -name '*.xx' \) -atime +7 -exec rm {} \;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

removes all files named <B>tmp</B> or ending in <B>.xx</B> that have
not been accessed for seven or more 24-hour periods.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
The following command:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>find . -perm -o+w,+s
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

prints ( <B>-print</B> is assumed) the names of all files in or below
the current directory, with all of the file permission
bits S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and S_IWOTH set.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 4.<DD>
The following command:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>find . -name SCCS -prune -o -print
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

recursively prints pathnames of all files in the current directory
and below, but skips directories named SCCS and files in
them.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 5.<DD>
The following command:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>find . -print -name SCCS -prune
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

behaves as in the previous example, but prints the names of the SCCS
directories.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 6.<DD>
The following command is roughly equivalent to the <B>-nt</B> extension
to <I>test</I>:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>if [ -n &quot;$(find file1 -prune -newer file2)&quot; ]; then
    printf %s\\n &quot;file1 is newer than file2&quot;
fi
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 7.<DD>
The descriptions of <B>-atime</B>, <B>-ctime</B>, and <B>-mtime</B> use
the terminology <I>n</I> &quot;86400 second periods
(days)&quot;. For example, a file accessed at 23:59 is selected by:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>find . -atime -1 -print
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

at 00:01 the next day (less than 24 hours later, not more than one
day ago); the midnight boundary between days has no effect on
the 24-hour calculation.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

The <B>-a</B> operator was retained as an optional operator for compatibility
with historical shell scripts, even though it is
redundant with expression concatenation.
<P>

The descriptions of the <B>'-'</B> modifier on the <I>mode</I> and <I>onum</I>
arguments to the <B>-perm</B> primary agree
with historical practice on BSD and System V implementations. System
V and BSD documentation both describe it in terms of checking
additional bits; in fact, it uses the same bits, but checks for having
at least all of the matching bits set instead of having
exactly the matching bits set.
<P>

The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the
general nature of the contents of prompts are specified
because:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than those used
on historical implementations.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Since the historical prompt strings do not terminate with &lt;newline&gt;s,
there is no portable way for another program to
interact with the prompts of this utility via pipes.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Therefore, an application using this prompting option relies on the
system to provide the most suitable dialog directly with the
user, based on the general guidelines specified.
<P>

The <B>-name</B> <I>file</I> operand was changed to use the shell pattern
matching notation so that <I>find</I> is consistent
with other utilities using pattern matching.
<P>

The <B>-size</B> operand refers to the size of a file, rather than
the number of blocks it may occupy in the file system. The
intent is that the <I>st_size</I> field defined in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 should be used,
not the <I>st_blocks</I> found in historical implementations. There
are at least two reasons for this:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
In both System V and BSD, <I>find</I> only uses <I>st_size</I> in size
calculations for the operands specified by this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. (BSD uses <I>st_blocks</I> only when processing
the <B>-ls</B> primary.)
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
Users usually think of file size in terms of bytes, which is also
the unit used by the <I>ls</I> utility for the output from the <B>-l</B>
option. (In both System V and BSD, <I>ls</I> uses <I>st_size</I> for
the <B>-l</B> option size field and uses <I>st_blocks</I> for the <I>ls</I>
<B>-s</B> calculations. This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does
not specify <I>ls</I> <B>-s</B>.)
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The descriptions of <B>-atime</B>, <B>-ctime</B>, and <B>-mtime</B> were
changed from the SVID description of <I>n</I> &quot;days''
to &quot;24-hour periods&quot;. The description is also different in terms of
the exact timeframe for the <I>n</I> case (<I>versus</I> the
<I>+n</I> or <I>-n</I>), but it matches all known historical implementations.
It refers to one 86400 second period in the past, not
any time from the beginning of that period to the current time. For
example, <B>-atime</B> 3 is true if the file was accessed any
time in the period from 72 hours to 48 hours ago.
<P>

Historical implementations do not modify <B>&quot;{}&quot;</B> when it appears
as a substring of an <B>-exec</B> or <B>-ok</B>
<I>utility_name</I> or argument string. There have been numerous user
requests for this extension, so this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 allows the desired behavior. At least one recent
implementation does support this feature, but
encountered several problems in managing memory allocation and dealing
with multiple occurrences of <B>&quot;{}&quot;</B> in a string while
it was being developed, so it is not yet required behavior.
<P>

Assuming the presence of <B>-print</B> was added to correct a historical
pitfall that plagues novice users, it is entirely
upwards-compatible from the historical System V <I>find</I> utility.
In its simplest form ( <I>find</I> <I>directory</I>), it could
be confused with the historical BSD fast <I>find</I>. The BSD developers
agreed that adding <B>-print</B> as a default expression
was the correct decision and have added the fast <I>find</I> functionality
within a new utility called <I>locate</I>.
<P>

Historically, the <B>-L</B> option was implemented using the primary
<B>-follow</B>. The <B>-H</B> and <B>-L</B> options were
added for two reasons. First, they offer a finer granularity of control
and consistency with other programs that walk file
hierarchies. Second, the <B>-follow</B> primary always evaluated to
true. As they were historically really global variables that
took effect before the traversal began, some valid expressions had
unexpected results. An example is the expression <B>-print</B>
<B>-o</B> <B>-follow</B>. Because <B>-print</B> always evaluates to true,
the standard order of evaluation implies that
<B>-follow</B> would never be evaluated. This was never the case. Historical
practice for the <B>-follow</B> primary, however, is
not consistent. Some implementations always follow symbolic links
on the command line whether <B>-follow</B> is specified or not.
Others follow symbolic links on the command line only if <B>-follow</B>
is specified. Both behaviors are provided by the <B>-H</B>
and <B>-L</B> options, but scripts using the current <B>-follow</B>
primary would be broken if the <B>-follow</B> option is
specified to work either way.
<P>

Since the <B>-L</B> option resolves all symbolic links and the <B>-type</B>
<I>l</I> primary is true for symbolic links that
still exist after symbolic links have been resolved, the command:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>find -L . -type l
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

prints a list of symbolic links reachable from the current directory
that do not resolve to accessible files.
<P>

A feature of SVR4's <I>find</I> utility was the <B>-exec</B> primary's
<B>+</B> terminator. This allowed filenames containing
special characters (especially &lt;newline&gt;s) to be grouped together
without the problems that occur if such filenames are piped
to <I>xargs</I>. Other implementations have added other ways to get
around this problem,
notably a <B>-print0</B> primary that wrote filenames with a null byte
terminator. This was considered here, but not adopted. Using
a null terminator meant that any utility that was going to process
<I>find</I>'s <B>-print0</B> output had to add a new option to
parse the null terminators it would now be reading.
<P>

The <B>&quot;-exec ... {} +&quot;</B> syntax adopted was a result of IEEE PASC
Interpretation 1003.2 #210. It should be noted that this
is an incompatible change to the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard. For
example, the following command prints all files with a
<B>'-'</B> after their name if they are regular files, and a <B>'+'</B>
otherwise:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>find / -type f -exec echo {} - ';' -o -exec echo {} + ';'
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The change invalidates usage like this. Even though the previous standard
stated that this usage would work, in practice many
did not support it and the standard developers felt it better to now
state that this was not allowable.
