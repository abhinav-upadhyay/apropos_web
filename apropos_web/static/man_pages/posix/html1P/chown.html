<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>chown</I> utility shall set the user ID of the file named by
each <I>file</I> operand to the user ID specified by the
<I>owner</I> operand.
<P>

For each <I>file</I> operand, or, if the <B>-R</B> option is used, each
file encountered while walking the directory trees
specified by the <I>file</I> operands, the <I>chown</I> utility shall
perform actions equivalent to the <I>chown</I>() function defined in
the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001,
called with the following arguments:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
The <I>file</I> operand shall be used as the <I>path</I> argument.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
The user ID indicated by the <I>owner</I> portion of the first operand
shall be used as the <I>owner</I> argument.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
If the <I>group</I> portion of the first operand is given, the group
ID indicated by it shall be used as the <I>group</I>
argument; otherwise, the group ownership shall not be changed.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Unless <I>chown</I> is invoked by a process with appropriate privileges,
the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of a regular file
shall be cleared upon successful completion; the set-user-ID and set-group-ID
bits of other file types may be cleared.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The <I>chown</I> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
<P>

The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h</B><DD>
If the system supports user IDs for symbolic links, for each <I>file</I>
operand that names a file of type symbolic link,
<I>chown</I> shall attempt to set the user ID of the symbolic link.
If the system supports group IDs for symbolic links, and a
group ID was specified, for each <I>file</I> operand that names a file
of type symbolic link, <I>chown</I> shall attempt to set the
group ID of the symbolic link. If the system does not support user
or group IDs for symbolic links, for each <I>file</I> operand
that names a file of type symbolic link, <I>chown</I> shall do nothing
more with the current file and shall go on to any remaining
files.
<DT><B>-H</B><DD>
If the <B>-R</B> option is specified and a symbolic link referencing
a file of type directory is specified on the command line,
<I>chown</I> shall change the user ID (and group ID, if specified)
of the directory referenced by the symbolic link and all files
in the file hierarchy below it.
<DT><B>-L</B><DD>
If the <B>-R</B> option is specified and a symbolic link referencing
a file of type directory is specified on the command line
or encountered during the traversal of a file hierarchy, <I>chown</I>
shall change the user ID (and group ID, if specified) of the
directory referenced by the symbolic link and all files in the file
hierarchy below it.
<DT><B>-P</B><DD>
If the <B>-R</B> option is specified and a symbolic link is specified
on the command line or encountered during the traversal
of a file hierarchy, <I>chown</I> shall change the owner ID (and group
ID, if specified) of the symbolic link if the system
supports this operation. The <I>chown</I> utility shall not follow
the symbolic link to any other part of the file hierarchy.
<DT><B>-R</B><DD>
Recursively change file user and group IDs. For each <I>file</I> operand
that names a directory, <I>chown</I> shall change the
user ID (and group ID, if specified) of the directory and all files
in the file hierarchy below it. Unless a <B>-H</B>, <B>-L</B>,
or <B>-P</B> option is specified, it is unspecified which of these
options will be used as the default.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options <B>-H</B>,
<B>-L</B>, and <B>-P</B> shall not be considered an error.
The last option specified shall determine the behavior of the utility.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPERANDS</H2>

<P>

The following operands shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>owner</I><B>[</B>:<I>group</I><B>]</B><DD>
A user ID and optional group ID to be assigned to <I>file</I>. The
<I>owner</I> portion of this operand shall be a user name
from the user database or a numeric user ID. Either specifies a user
ID which shall be given to each file named by one of the
<I>file</I> operands. If a numeric <I>owner</I> operand exists in the
user database as a user name, the user ID number associated
with that user name shall be used as the user ID. Similarly, if the
<I>group</I> portion of this operand is present, it shall be a
group name from the group database or a numeric group ID. Either specifies
a group ID which shall be given to each file. If a
numeric group operand exists in the group database as a group name,
the group ID number associated with that group name shall be
used as the group ID.
<DT><I>file</I><DD>
A pathname of a file whose user ID is to be modified.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDIN</H2>

<P>

Not used.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<P>

The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
<I>chown</I>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>LANG</I><DD>
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
<DT><I>LC_ALL</I><DD>
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
<DT><I>LC_CTYPE</I><DD>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).
<DT><I>LC_MESSAGES</I><DD>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
<DT><I>NLSPATH</I><DD>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <I>LC_MESSAGES
.</I>

<H2>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</H2>

None.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXIT STATUS</H2>

<P>

The following exit values shall be returned:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&nbsp;0<DD>
The utility executed successfully and all requested changes were made.
<DT>&gt;0<DD>
An error occurred.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</H2>

<P>

Default.
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

Only the owner of a file or the user with appropriate privileges may
change the owner or group of a file.
<P>

Some implementations restrict the use of <I>chown</I> to a user with
appropriate privileges.
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

The System V and BSD versions use different exit status codes. Some
implementations used the exit status as a count of the
number of errors that occurred; this practice is unworkable since
it can overflow the range of valid exit status values. These are
masked by specifying only 0 and &gt;0 as exit values.
<P>

The functionality of <I>chown</I> is described substantially through
references to functions in the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. In this way, there is no duplication of effort
required for describing the interactions of
permissions, multiple groups, and so on.
<P>

The 4.3 BSD method of specifying both owner and group was included
in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 because:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
There are cases where the desired end condition could not be achieved
using the <I>chgrp</I> and <I>chown</I> (that only changed the user
ID) utilities. (If the current owner is not
a member of the desired group and the desired owner is not a member
of the current group, the <I>chown</I>() function could fail unless
both owner and group are changed at the same time.)
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Even if they could be changed independently, in cases where both are
being changed, there is a 100% performance penalty caused
by being forced to invoke both utilities.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The BSD syntax <I>user</I>[. <I>group</I>] was changed to <I>user</I>[:
<I>group</I>] in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 because the period is a valid character in
login names (as specified by the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, login names consist of characters in the
portable filename character set). The colon character
was chosen as the replacement for the period character because it
would never be allowed as a character in a user name or group
name on historical implementations.
<P>

The <B>-R</B> option is considered by some observers as an undesirable
departure from the historical UNIX system tools approach;
since a tool, <I>find</I>, already exists to recurse over directories,
there seemed to be no
good reason to require other tools to have to duplicate that functionality.
However, the <B>-R</B> option was deemed an important
user convenience, is far more efficient than forking a separate process
for each element of the directory hierarchy, and is in
widespread historical use.
