<H2>NAME</H2>

pathchk - check pathnames
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>pathchk</B> <B>[</B><B>-p</B><B>]</B> <I>pathname</I><B>...</B>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>pathchk</I> utility shall check that one or more pathnames are
valid (that is, they could be used to access or create a
file without causing syntax errors) and portable (that is, no filename
truncation results). More extensive portability checks are
provided by the <B>-p</B> option.
<P>

By default, the <I>pathchk</I> utility shall check each component of
each <I>pathname</I> operand based on the underlying file
system. A diagnostic shall be written for each <I>pathname</I> operand
that:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Is longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes (see <B>Pathname Variable Values</B>
in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Chapter 13, Headers, <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/limits.h">limits.h</A>&gt;</I>)
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Contains any component longer than {NAME_MAX} bytes in its containing
directory
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Contains any component in a directory that is not searchable
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Contains any character in any component that is not valid in its containing
directory
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The format of the diagnostic message is not specified, but shall indicate
the error detected and the corresponding
<I>pathname</I> operand.
<P>

It shall not be considered an error if one or more components of a
<I>pathname</I> operand do not exist as long as a file
matching the pathname specified by the missing components could be
created that does not violate any of the checks specified
above.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The <I>pathchk</I> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
<P>

The following option shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-p</B><DD>
Instead of performing checks based on the underlying file system,
write a diagnostic for each <I>pathname</I> operand that: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Is longer than {_POSIX_PATH_MAX} bytes (see <B>Minimum Values</B> in
the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Chapter 13, Headers, <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/limits.h">limits.h</A>&gt;</I>)
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Contains any component longer than {_POSIX_NAME_MAX} bytes
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Contains any character in any component that is not in the portable
filename character set

<H2>OPERANDS</H2>

<P>

The following operand shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>pathname</I><DD>
A pathname to be checked.

<H2>INPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<P>

The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
<I>pathchk</I>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>LANG</I><DD>
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
<DT><I>LC_ALL</I><DD>
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
<DT><I>LC_CTYPE</I><DD>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).
<DT><I>LC_MESSAGES</I><DD>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
<DT><I>NLSPATH</I><DD>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <I>LC_MESSAGES
.</I>

<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

The <I>test</I> utility can be used to determine whether a given pathname
names an existing
file; it does not, however, give any indication of whether or not
any component of the pathname was truncated in a directory where
the _POSIX_NO_TRUNC feature is not in effect. The <I>pathchk</I> utility
does not check for file existence; it performs checks to
determine whether a pathname does exist or could be created with no
pathname component truncation.
<P>

The <I>noclobber</I> option in the shell (see the <I>set</I> special
built-in) can be used to
atomically create a file. As with all file creation semantics in the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, it
guarantees atomic creation, but still depends on applications to agree
on conventions and cooperate on the use of files after they
have been created.
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

To verify that all pathnames in an imported data interchange archive
are legitimate and unambiguous on the current system:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>pax -f archive | sed -e '/ == .*/s///' | xargs pathchk
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
    pax -r -f archive
else
    echo Investigate problems before importing files.
    exit 1
fi
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

To verify that all files in the current directory hierarchy could
be moved to any system conforming to the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 that also supports the <I>pax</I>
utility:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>find . -print | xargs pathchk -p
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
    pax -w -f archive .
else
    echo Portable archive cannot be created.
    exit 1
fi
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

To verify that a user-supplied pathname names a readable file and
that the application can create a file extending the given
path without truncation and without overwriting any existing file:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>case $- in
    *C*)    reset=&quot;&quot;;;
    *)      reset=&quot;set +C&quot;
            set -C;;
esac
test -r &quot;$path&quot; &amp;&amp; pathchk &quot;$path.out&quot; &amp;&amp;
    rm &quot;$path.out&quot; &gt; &quot;$path.out&quot;
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    printf &quot;%s: %s not found or %s.out fails \
creation checks.\n&quot; $0 &quot;$path&quot; &quot;$path&quot;
    $reset    # Reset the noclobber option in case a trap
              # on EXIT depends on it.
    exit 1
fi
$reset
PROCESSING &lt; &quot;$path&quot; &gt; &quot;$path.out&quot;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The following assumptions are made in this example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
<B>PROCESSING</B> represents the code that is used by the application
to use <B>$path</B> once it is verified that
<B>$path.out</B> works as intended.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
The state of the <I>noclobber</I> option is unknown when this code
is invoked and should be set on exit to the state it was in
when this code was invoked. (The <B>reset</B> variable is used in this
example to restore the initial state.)
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
Note the usage of:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>rm &quot;$path.out&quot; &gt; &quot;$path.out&quot;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> a.<DD>
The <I>pathchk</I> command has already verified, at this point, that
<B>$path.out</B> is not truncated.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> b.<DD>
With the <I>noclobber</I> option set, the shell verifies that <B>$path.out</B>
does not already exist before invoking <I>rm</I>.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> c.<DD>
If the shell succeeded in creating <B>$path.out</B>, <I>rm</I> removes
it so that the
application can create the file again in the <B>PROCESSING</B> step.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> d.<DD>
If the <B>PROCESSING</B> step wants the file to exist already when
it is invoked, the:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>rm &quot;$path.out&quot; &gt; &quot;$path.out&quot;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

should be replaced with:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>&gt; &quot;$path.out&quot;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

which verifies that the file did not already exist, but leaves <B>$path.out</B>
in place for use by <B>PROCESSING</B>.
<P>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

The <I>pathchk</I> utility was new for the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2:1993 standard.
It, along with the <I>set</I> <B>-C</B>( <I>noclobber</I>) option added
to the shell, replaces the
<I>mktemp</I>, <I>validfnam</I>, and <I>create</I> utilities that appeared
in early proposals. All of these utilities were attempts
to solve several common problems:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Verify the validity (for several different definitions of &quot;valid&quot;)
of a pathname supplied by a user, generated by an
application, or imported from an external source.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Atomically create a file.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Perform various string handling functions to generate a temporary
filename.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The <I>create</I> utility, included in an early proposal, provided
checking and atomic creation in a single invocation of the
utility; these are orthogonal issues and need not be grouped into
a single utility. Note that the <I>noclobber</I> option also
provides a way of creating a lock for process synchronization; since
it provides an atomic <I>create</I>, there is no race between
a test for existence and the following creation if it did not exist.
<P>

Having a function like <I>tmpnam</I>() in the ISO&nbsp;C standard is important
in many
high-level languages. The shell programming language, however, has
built-in string manipulation facilities, making it very easy to
construct temporary filenames. The names needed obviously depend on
the application, but are frequently of a form similar to:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>$TMPDIR/</B><I>application_abbreviation</I><B>$$.</B><I>suffix</I>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

In cases where there is likely to be contention for a given suffix,
a simple shell <B>for</B> or <B>while</B> loop can be used
with the shell <I>noclobber</I> option to create a file without risk
of collisions, as long as applications trying to use the same
filename name space are cooperating on the use of files after they
have been created.
