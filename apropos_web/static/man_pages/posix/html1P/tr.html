<h1>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h1> The operands  <i>string1</i> and <i>string2</i> (if specified) define two arrays of characters. The constructs in the following list can be used to specify characters or single-character collating elements. If any of the constructs result in multi-character collating elements,  <i>tr</i> shall exclude, without a diagnostic, those multi-character elements from the resulting array.<dl>

<i>character</i></dt>
<dd>
Any character not described by one of the conventions below shall represent itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
\<i>octal</i></dt>
<dd>
Octal sequences can be used to represent characters with specific coded values. An octal sequence shall consist of a backslash followed by the longest sequence of one, two, or three-octal-digit characters (01234567). The sequence shall cause the value whose encoding is represented by the one, two, or three-digit octal integer to be placed into the array. If the size of a byte on the system is greater than nine bits, the valid escape sequence used to represent a byte is implementation-defined. Multi-byte characters require multiple, concatenated escape sequences of this type, including the leading  <b>'\'</b> for each byte.</dd>

The results of using any other character, other than an octal digit, following the backslash are unspecified.</dd>

In the POSIX locale, this construct shall represent the range of collating elements between the range endpoints (as long as neither endpoint is an octal sequence of the form \ <i>octal</i>), inclusive, as defined by the collation sequence. The characters or collating elements in the range shall be placed in the array in ascending collation sequence. If the second endpoint precedes the starting endpoint in the collation sequence, it is unspecified whether the range of collating elements is empty, or this construct is treated as invalid. In locales other than the POSIX locale, this construct has unspecified behavior.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">

Such a specification shall be interpreted as a request for case conversion. When [:  <i>lower</i>:] appears in  <i>string1</i> and [: <i>upper</i>:] appears in <i>string2</i>, the arrays shall contain the characters from the  <b>toupper</b> mapping in the  <i>LC_CTYPE</i> category of the current locale.

When <i>string2</i> is shorter than <i>string1</i>, a difference results between historical System&#160;V and BSD systems. A BSD system pads  <i>string2</i> with the last character found in <i>string2</i>. Thus, it is possible to do the following:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>tr 0123456789 d</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
which would translate all digits to the letter <b>'d'</b> . Since this area is specifically unspecified in this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, both the BSD and System&#160;V behaviors are allowed, but a conforming application cannot rely on the BSD behavior. It would have to code the example in the following way:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">

<h1>RATIONALE</h1> In some early proposals, an explicit option  <b>-n</b> was added to disable the historical behavior of stripping NUL characters from the input. It was considered that automatically stripping NUL characters from the input was not correct functionality. However, the removal of  <b>-n</b> in a later proposal does not remove the requirement that  <i>tr</i> correctly process NUL characters in its input stream. NUL characters can be stripped by using  <i>tr</i> <b>-d</b> '\000'.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Historical implementations of <i>tr</i> differ widely in syntax and behavior. For example, the BSD version has not needed the bracket characters for the repetition sequence. The  <i>tr</i> utility syntax is based more closely on the System V and XPG3 model while attempting to accommodate historical BSD implementations. In the case of the short  <i>string2</i> padding, the decision was to unspecify the behavior and preserve System V and XPG3 scripts, which might find difficulty with the BSD method. The assumption was made that BSD users of  <i>tr</i> have to make accommodations to meet the syntax defined here. Since it is possible to use the repetition sequence to duplicate the desired behavior, whereas there is no simple way to achieve the System V method, this was the correct, if not desirable, approach.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The use of octal values to specify control characters, while having historical precedents, is not portable. The introduction of escape sequences for control characters should provide the necessary portability. It is recognized that this may cause some historical scripts to break.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An early proposal included support for multi-character collating elements. It was pointed out that, while  <i>tr</i> does employ some syntactical elements from REs, the aim of  <i>tr</i> is quite different; ranges, for example, do not have a similar meaning (``any of the chars in the range matches&quot;,  <i>versus</i> &quot;translate each character in the range to the output counterpart&quot;). As a result, the previously included support for multi-character collating elements has been removed. What remains are ranges in current collation order (to support, for example, accented characters), character classes, and equivalence classes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In XPG3 the [: <i>class</i>:] and [= <i>equiv</i>=] conventions are shown with double brackets, as in RE syntax. However,  <i>tr</i> does not implement RE principles; it just borrows part of the syntax. Consequently, [:  <i>class</i>:] and [=  <i>equiv</i>=] should be regarded as syntactical elements on a par with [  <i>x</i>* <i>n</i>], which is not an RE bracket expression.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The standard developers will consider changes to <i>tr</i> that allow it to translate characters between different character encodings, or they will consider providing a new utility to accomplish this.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On historical System V systems, a range expression requires enclosing square-brackets, such as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, BSD-based systems did not require the brackets, and this convention is used here to avoid breaking large numbers of BSD scripts:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>tr a-z A-Z</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The preceding System V script will continue to work because the brackets, treated as regular characters, are translated to themselves. However, any System V script that relied on  <b>&quot;a-z&quot;</b> representing the three characters  <b>'a'</b>,  <b>'-'</b>, and <b>'z'</b> have to be rewritten as <b>&quot;az-&quot;</b> .<div class="spacer">
</div>
The ISO&#160;POSIX-2:1993 standard had a <b>-c</b> option that behaved similarly to the  <b>-C</b> option, but did not supply functionality equivalent to the  <b>-c</b> option specified in IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001. This meant that historical practice of being able to specify  <i>tr</i> <b>-d</b>\200-\377 (which would delete all bytes with the top bit set) would have no effect because, in the C locale, bytes with the values octal 200 to octal 377 are not characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The earlier version also said that octal sequences referred to collating elements and could be placed adjacent to each other to specify multi-byte characters. However, it was noted that this caused ambiguities because  <i>tr</i> would not be able to tell whether adjacent octal sequences were intending to specify multi-byte characters or multiple single byte characters. IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 specifies that octal sequences always refer to single byte binary values.</div>
