<h1>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h1> Default.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> The order for command search allows functions to override regular built-ins and path searches. This utility is necessary to allow functions that have the same name as a utility to call the utility (instead of a recursive call to the function).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The system default path is available using <i>getconf</i>; however, since  <i>getconf</i> may need to have the <i>PATH</i> set up before it can be called itself, the following can be used:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>command -p getconf _CS_PATH</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are some advantages to suppressing the special characteristics of special built-ins on occasion. For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>command exec &gt;</b> <i>unwritable-file</i><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
does not cause a non-interactive script to abort, so that the output status can be checked by the script.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>command</i>, <i>env</i>, <i>nohup</i>, <i>time</i>, and <i>xargs</i> utilities have been specified to use exit code 127 if an error occurs so that applications can distinguish &quot;failure to find a utility&quot; from &quot;invoked utility exited with an error indication&quot;. The value 127 was chosen because it is not commonly used for other meanings; most utilities use small values for &quot;normal error conditions&quot; and the values above 128 can be confused with termination due to receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner to indicate that the utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error messages differentiating the 126 and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes 126 and 127 is based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all attempts to  <i>exec</i> the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses 126 when any attempt to  <i>exec</i> the utility fails for any other reason.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since the <b>-v</b> and <b>-V</b> options of <i>command</i> produce output in relation to the current shell execution environment,  <i>command</i> is generally provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is called in a subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as one of the following:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>(PATH=foo command -v)</b><br/>
<b> nohup command -v</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
it does not necessarily produce correct results. For example, when called with  <i>nohup</i> or an <i>exec</i> function, in a separate utility execution environment, most implementations are not able to identify aliases, functions, or special built-ins.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Two types of regular built-ins could be encountered on a system and these are described separately by  <i>command</i>. The description of command search in  <i>Command Search and Execution</i> allows for a standard utility to be implemented as a regular built-in as long as it is found in the appropriate place in a  <i>PATH</i> search. So, for example,  <i>command</i> <b>-v</b> <i>true</i> might yield <b>/bin/true</b> or some similar pathname. Other implementation-defined utilities that are not defined by this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 might exist only as built-ins and have no pathname associated with them. These produce output identified as (regular) built-ins. Applications encountering these are not able to count on  <i>exec</i>ing them, using them with  <i>nohup</i>, overriding them with a different <i>PATH</i>, and so on.</div>

</div>
At this point, given correct permissions on the directories called by  <i>PATH</i>,  the script has the ability to ensure that any utility it calls is the intended one. It is being very cautious because it assumes that implementation extensions may be present that would allow user functions to exist when it is invoked; this capability is not specified by this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, but it is not prohibited as an extension. For example, the  <i>ENV</i> variable precedes the invocation of the script with a user start-up script. Such a script could define functions to spoof the application.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> Since  <i>command</i> is a regular built-in utility it is always found prior to the  <i>PATH</i> search.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is nothing in the description of <i>command</i> that implies the command line is parsed any differently from that of any other simple command. For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>command a | b ; c</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
is not parsed in any special way that causes <b>'|'</b> or <b>';'</b> to be treated other than a pipe operator or semicolon or that prevents function lookup on  <b>b</b> or <b>c</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>command</i> utility is somewhat similar to the Eighth Edition shell  <i>builtin</i> command, but since <i>command</i> also goes to the file system to search for utilities, the name  <i>builtin</i> would not be intuitive.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>command</i> utility is most likely to be provided as a regular built-in. It is not listed as a special built-in for the following reasons:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
The removal of exportable functions made the special precedence of a special built-in unnecessary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
A special built-in has special properties (see <i>Special Built-In</i>  <i>Utilities</i> ) that were inappropriate for invoking other utilities. For example, two commands such as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>date &gt;</b> <i>unwritable-file</i><b></b><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
command date &gt;<b> </b><i>unwritable-file</i><b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
would have entirely different results; in a non-interactive script, the former would continue to execute the next command, the latter would abort. Introducing this semantic difference along with suppressing functions was seen to be non-intuitive.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-p</b> option is present because it is useful to be able to ensure a safe path search that finds all the standard utilities. This search might not be identical to the one that occurs through one of the  <i>exec</i> functions (as defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001) when  <i>PATH</i> is unset. At the very least, this feature is required to allow the script to access the correct version of  <i>getconf</i> so that the value of the default path can be accurately retrieved.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>command</i> <b>-v</b> and <b>-V</b> options were added to satisfy requirements from users that are currently accomplished by three different historical utilities:  <i>type</i> in the System V shell,  <i>whence</i> in the KornShell, and  <i>which</i> in the C shell. Since there is no historical agreement on how and what to accomplish here, the POSIX  <i>command</i> utility was enhanced and the historical utilities were left unmodified. The C shell  <i>which</i> merely conducts a path search. The KornShell  <i>whence</i> is more elaborate-in addition to the categories required by POSIX, it also reports on tracked aliases, exported aliases, and undefined functions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The output format of <b>-V</b> was left mostly unspecified because human users are its only audience. Applications should not be written to care about this information; they can use the output of  <b>-v</b> to differentiate between various types of commands, but the additional information that may be emitted by the more verbose  <b>-V</b> is not needed and should not be arbitrarily constrained in its verbosity or localization for application parsing reasons.</div>
