qdel - delete batch jobs
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>qdel</B> <I>job_identifier</I> <B>... </B>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

A batch job is deleted by sending a request to the batch server that
manages the batch job. A batch job that has been deleted is
no longer subject to management by batch services.
<P>

The <I>qdel</I> utility is a user-accessible client of batch services
that requests the deletion of one or more batch jobs.
<P>

The <I>qdel</I> utility shall request a batch server to delete those
batch jobs for which a batch <I>job_identifier</I> is
presented to the utility.
<P>

The <I>qdel</I> utility shall delete batch jobs in the order in which
their batch <I>job_identifier</I>s are presented to the
utility.
<P>

If the <I>qdel</I> utility fails to process any batch <I>job_identifier</I>
successfully, the utility shall proceed to process
the remaining batch <I>job_identifier</I>s, if any.
<P>

The <I>qdel</I> utility shall delete each batch job by sending a <I>Delete
Job Request</I> to the batch server that manages the
batch job.
<P>

The <I>qdel</I> utility shall not exit until the batch job corresponding
to each successfully processed batch
<I>job_identifier</I> has been deleted.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPERANDS</H2>

<P>

The <I>qdel</I> utility shall accept one or more operands that conform
to the syntax for a batch <I>job_identifier</I> (see <I>Batch Job Identifier</I>
).
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDIN</H2>

<P>

Not used.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<P>

The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
<I>qdel</I>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>LANG</I><DD>
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
<DT><I>LC_ALL</I><DD>
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
<DT><I>LC_CTYPE</I><DD>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).
<DT><I>LC_MESSAGES</I><DD>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
<DT><I>LOGNAME</I><DD>
Determine the login name of the user.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</H2>

<P>

Default.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDOUT</H2>

<P>

An implementation of the <I>qdel</I> utility may write informative
messages to standard output.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDERR</H2>

<P>

The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OUTPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXIT STATUS</H2>

<P>

The following exit values shall be returned:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&nbsp;0<DD>
Successful completion.
<DT>&gt;0<DD>
An error occurred.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</H2>

<P>

In addition to the default behavior, the <I>qdel</I> utility shall
not be required to write a diagnostic message to standard
error when the error reply received from a batch server indicates
that the batch <I>job_identifier</I> does not exist on the
server. Whether or not the <I>qdel</I> utility waits to output the
diagnostic message while attempting to locate the job on other
servers is implementation-defined.
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

None.
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

The <I>qdel</I> utility allows users and administrators to delete jobs.
<P>

The <I>qdel</I> utility provides functionality that is not otherwise
available. For example, the <I>kill</I> utility of the operating system
does not suffice. First, to use the <I>kill</I> utility, the user might
have to log in on a remote node, because the <I>kill</I> utility does
not operate across the network. Second, unlike <I>qdel</I>, <I>kill</I>
cannot remove jobs from queues. Lastly, the arguments of the <I>qdel</I>
utility are job
identifiers rather than process identifiers, and so this utility can
be passed the output of the <I>qselect</I> utility, thus providing
users with a means of deleting a list of jobs.
<P>

Because a set of jobs can be selected using the <I>qselect</I> utility,
the <I>qdel</I>
utility has not been complicated with options that provide for selection
of jobs. Instead, the batch jobs to be deleted are
identified individually by their job identifiers.
<P>

Historically, the <I>qdel</I> utility has been a component of NQS,
the existing practice on which it is based. However, the
<I>qdel</I> utility defined in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not provide an option for specifying a signal
number to send to the batch job prior to the killing of the process;
that capability has been subsumed by the <I>qsig</I> utility.
<P>

A discussion was held about the delays of networking and the possibility
that the batch server may never respond, due to a down
router, down batch server, or other network mishap. The DESCRIPTION
records this under the words &quot;fails to process any job
identifier&quot;. In the broad sense, the network problem is also an error,
which causes the failure to process the batch job
identifier.
