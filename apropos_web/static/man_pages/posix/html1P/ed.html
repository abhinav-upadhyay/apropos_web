<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>ed</I> utility is a line-oriented text editor that uses two
modes: <I>command mode</I> and <I>input mode</I>. In command
mode the input characters shall be interpreted as commands, and in
input mode they shall be interpreted as text. See the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The <I>ed</I> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
<P>

The following options shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-p&nbsp;</B> <I>string</I><DD>
Use <I>string</I> as the prompt string when in command mode. By default,
there shall be no prompt string.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
Suppress the writing of byte counts by <B>e</B>, <B>E</B>, <B>r</B>,
and <B>w</B> commands and of the <B>'!'</B> prompt after
a !<I>command</I>.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPERANDS</H2>

<P>

The following operand shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>file</I><DD>
If the <I>file</I> argument is given, <I>ed</I> shall simulate an <B>e</B>
command on the file named by the pathname,
<I>file</I>, before accepting commands from the standard input. If
the <I>file</I> operand is <B>'-'</B>, the results are
unspecified.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDIN</H2>

<P>

The standard input shall be a text file consisting of commands, as
described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

The input files shall be text files.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<P>

The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
<I>ed</I>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>HOME</I><DD>
Determine the pathname of the user's home directory.
<DT><I>LANG</I><DD>
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
<DT><I>LC_ALL</I><DD>
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
<DT><I>LC_COLLATE</I><DD>
<P>
Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges, equivalence classes,
and multi-character collating elements within regular
expressions.
<DT><I>LC_CTYPE</I><DD>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files) and
the behavior of character classes within regular
expressions.
<DT><I>LC_MESSAGES</I><DD>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error and
informative messages written to standard output.
<DT><I>NLSPATH</I><DD>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <I>LC_MESSAGES
.</I> 
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</H2>

<P>

The <I>ed</I> utility shall take the standard action for all signals
(see the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section in <I>Utility Description Defaults</I>
) with the following exceptions:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>SIGINT<DD>
The <I>ed</I> utility shall interrupt its current activity, write the
string <B>&quot;?\n&quot;</B> to standard output, and return to
command mode (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section).
<DT>SIGHUP<DD>
If the buffer is not empty and has changed since the last write, the
<I>ed</I> utility shall attempt to write a copy of the
buffer in a file. First, the file named <B>ed.hup</B> in the current
directory shall be used; if that fails, the file named
<B>ed.hup</B> in the directory named by the <I>HOME</I> environment
variable shall be used. In any case, the <I>ed</I> utility
shall exit without returning to command mode.
<DT>SIGQUIT<DD>
The <I>ed</I> utility shall ignore this event.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDOUT</H2>

<P>

Various editing commands and the prompting feature (see <B>-p</B>)
write to standard output, as described in the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDERR</H2>

<P>

The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OUTPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

The output files shall be text files whose formats are dependent on
the editing commands given.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>ed</I> utility shall operate on a copy of the file it is editing;
changes made to the copy shall have no effect on the
file until a <B>w</B> (write) command is given. The copy of the text
is called the <I>buffer</I>.
<P>

Commands to <I>ed</I> have a simple and regular structure: zero, one,
or two <I>addresses</I> followed by a single-character
<I>command</I>, possibly followed by parameters to that command. These
addresses specify one or more lines in the buffer. Every
command that requires addresses has default addresses, so that the
addresses very often can be omitted. If the <B>-p</B> option is
specified, the prompt string shall be written to standard output before
each command is read.
<P>

In general, only one command can appear on a line. Certain commands
allow text to be input. This text is placed in the
appropriate place in the buffer. While <I>ed</I> is accepting text,
it is said to be in <I>input mode</I>. In this mode, no
commands shall be recognized; all input is merely collected. Input
mode is terminated by entering a line consisting of two
characters: a period ( <B>'.'</B> ) followed by a &lt;newline&gt;. This line
is not considered part of the input text.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Regular Expressions in ed</H3>

<P>

The <I>ed</I> utility shall support basic regular expressions, as described
in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 9.3, Basic Regular Expressions. Since
regular expressions in <I>ed</I> are always matched against single
lines (excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;s), never
against any larger section of text, there is no way for a regular
expression to match a &lt;newline&gt;.
<P>

A null RE shall be equivalent to the last RE encountered.
<P>

Regular expressions are used in addresses to specify lines, and in
some commands (for example, the <B>s</B> substitute command)
to specify portions of a line to be substituted.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Addresses in ed</H3>

<P>

Addressing in <I>ed</I> relates to the current line. Generally, the
current line is the last line affected by a command. The
current line number is the address of the current line. If the edit
buffer is not empty, the initial value for the current line
shall be the last line in the edit buffer; otherwise, zero.
<P>

Addresses shall be constructed as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
The period character ( <B>'.'</B> ) shall address the current line.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
The dollar sign character ( <B>'$'</B> ) shall address the last line
of the edit buffer.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
The positive decimal number <I>n</I> shall address the <I>n</I>th line
of the edit buffer.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 4.<DD>
The apostrophe-x character pair ( <B>&quot;'x&quot;</B> ) shall address the line
marked with the mark name character <I>x</I>, which
shall be a lowercase letter from the portable character set. It shall
be an error if the character has not been set to mark a line
or if the line that was marked is not currently present in the edit
buffer.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 5.<DD>
A BRE enclosed by slash characters ( <B>'/'</B> ) shall address the
first line found by searching forwards from the line
following the current line toward the end of the edit buffer and stopping
at the first line for which the line excluding the
terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the BRE. The BRE consisting of a null
BRE delimited by a pair of slash characters shall address
the next line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;
matches the last BRE encountered. In addition, the
second slash can be omitted at the end of a command line. Within the
BRE, a backslash-slash pair ( <B>&quot;\/&quot;</B> ) shall represent
a literal slash instead of the BRE delimiter. If necessary, the search
shall wrap around to the beginning of the buffer and
continue up to and including the current line, so that the entire
buffer is searched.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 6.<DD>
A BRE enclosed by question-mark characters ( <B>'?'</B> ) shall address
the first line found by searching backwards from the
line preceding the current line toward the beginning of the edit buffer
and stopping at the first line for which the line excluding
the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the BRE. The BRE consisting of a
null BRE delimited by a pair of question-mark characters (
<B>&quot;??&quot;</B> ) shall address the previous line for which the line excluding
the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last BRE
encountered. In addition, the second question-mark can be omitted
at the end of a command line. Within the BRE, a
backslash-question-mark pair ( <B>&quot;\?&quot;</B> ) shall represent a literal
question mark instead of the BRE delimiter. If necessary,
the search shall wrap around to the end of the buffer and continue
up to and including the current line, so that the entire buffer
is searched.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 7.<DD>
A plus-sign ( <B>'+'</B> ) or hyphen character ( <B>'-'</B> ) followed
by a decimal number shall address the current line
plus or minus the number. A plus-sign or hyphen character not followed
by a decimal number shall address the current line plus or
minus 1.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Addresses can be followed by zero or more address offsets, optionally
&lt;blank&gt;-separated. Address offsets are constructed
as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
A plus-sign or hyphen character followed by a decimal number shall
add or subtract, respectively, the indicated number of lines
to or from the address. A plus-sign or hyphen character not followed
by a decimal number shall add or subtract 1 to or from the
address.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
A decimal number shall add the indicated number of lines to the address.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

It shall not be an error for an intermediate address value to be less
than zero or greater than the last line in the edit
buffer. It shall be an error for the final address value to be less
than zero or greater than the last line in the edit buffer. It
shall be an error if a search for a BRE fails to find a matching line.
<P>

Commands accept zero, one, or two addresses. If more than the required
number of addresses are provided to a command that
requires zero addresses, it shall be an error. Otherwise, if more
than the required number of addresses are provided to a command,
the addresses specified first shall be evaluated and then discarded
until the maximum number of valid addresses remain, for the
specified command.
<P>

Addresses shall be separated from each other by a comma ( <B>','</B>
) or semicolon character ( <B>';'</B> ). In the case of
a semicolon separator, the current line ( <B>'.'</B> ) shall be set
to the first address, and only then will the second address
be calculated. This feature can be used to determine the starting
line for forwards and backwards searches; see rules 5. and 6.
<P>

Addresses can be omitted on either side of the comma or semicolon
separator, in which case the resulting address pairs shall be
as follows:
<TABLE>

</TABLE>

<P>

Any &lt;blank&gt;s included between addresses, address separators, or address
offsets shall be ignored.
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Commands in ed</H3>

<P>

In the following list of <I>ed</I> commands, the default addresses
are shown in parentheses. The number of addresses shown in
the default shall be the number expected by the command. The parentheses
are not part of the address; they show that the given
addresses are the default.
<P>

It is generally invalid for more than one command to appear on a line.
However, any command (except <B>e</B>, <B>E</B>,
<B>f</B>, <B>q</B>, <B>Q</B>, <B>r</B>, <B>w</B>, and <B>!</B>) can be suffixed
by the letter <B>l</B>, <B>n</B>, or <B>p</B>; in
which case, except for the <B>l</B>, <B>n</B>, and <B>p</B> commands,
the command shall be executed and then the new current line
shall be written as described below under the <B>l</B>, <B>n</B>, and
<B>p</B> commands. When an <B>l</B>, <B>n</B>, or <B>p</B>
suffix is used with an <B>l</B>, <B>n</B>, or <B>p</B> command, the command
shall write to standard output as described below, but
it is unspecified whether the suffix writes the current line again
in the requested format or whether the suffix has no effect. For
example, the <B>pl</B> command (base <B>p</B> command with an <B>l</B>
suffix) shall either write just the current line or write it
twice-once as specified for <B>p</B> and once as specified for <B>l</B>.
Also, the <B>g</B>, <B>G</B>, <B>v</B>, and <B>V</B>
commands shall take a command as a parameter.
<P>

Each address component can be preceded by zero or more &lt;blank&gt;s. The
command letter can be preceded by zero or more
&lt;blank&gt;s. If a suffix letter ( <B>l</B>, <B>n</B>, or <B>p</B>) is given,
the application shall ensure that it immediately
follows the command.
<P>

The <B>e</B>, <B>E</B>, <B>f</B>, <B>r</B>, and <B>w</B> commands shall
take an optional <I>file</I> parameter, separated from
the command letter by one or more &lt;blank&gt;s.
<P>

If changes have been made in the buffer since the last <B>w</B> command
that wrote the entire buffer, <I>ed</I> shall warn the
user if an attempt is made to destroy the editor buffer via the <B>e</B>
or <B>q</B> commands. The <I>ed</I> utility shall write
the string:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>&quot;?\n&quot;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

(followed by an explanatory message if <I>help mode</I> has been enabled
via the <B>H</B> command) to standard output and shall
continue in command mode with the current line number unchanged. If
the <B>e</B> or <B>q</B> command is repeated with no
intervening command, it shall take effect.
<P>

If a terminal disconnect is detected:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
If the buffer is not empty and has changed since the last write, the
<I>ed</I> utility shall attempt to write a copy of the
buffer to a file named <B>ed.hup</B> in the current directory. If this
write fails, <I>ed</I> shall attempt to write a copy of the
buffer to a filename <B>ed.hup</B> in the directory named by the <I>HOME</I>
environment variable. If both these attempts fail,
<I>ed</I> shall exit without saving the buffer.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The <I>ed</I> utility shall not write the file to the currently remembered
pathname or return to command mode, and shall
terminate with a non-zero exit status.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

If an end-of-file is detected on standard input:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
If the <I>ed</I> utility is in input mode, <I>ed</I> shall terminate
input mode and return to command mode. It is unspecified if
any partially entered lines (that is, input text without a terminating
&lt;newline&gt;) are discarded from the input text.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
If the <I>ed</I> utility is in command mode, it shall act as if a <B>q</B>
command had been entered.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

If the closing delimiter of an RE or of a replacement string (for
example, <B>'/'</B> ) in a <B>g</B>, <B>G</B>, <B>s</B>,
<B>v</B>, or <B>V</B> command would be the last character before a &lt;newline&gt;,
that delimiter can be omitted, in which case
the addressed line shall be written. For example, the following pairs
of commands are equivalent:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>s/s1/s2   s/s1/s2/p
g/s1      g/s1/p
?s1       ?s1?
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

If an invalid command is entered, <I>ed</I> shall write the string:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>&quot;?\n&quot;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

(followed by an explanatory message if <I>help mode</I> has been enabled
via the <B>H</B> command) to standard output and shall

In the <B>g</B> command, the first step shall be to mark every line
for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;
matches the given RE. Then, going sequentially from the beginning
of the file to the end of the file, the given <I>command list</I>
shall be executed for each marked line, with the current line number
set to the address of that line. Any line modified by the
<I>command list</I> shall be unmarked. When the <B>g</B> command completes,
the current line number shall have the value assigned
by the last command in the <I>command list</I>. If there were no matching
lines, the current line number shall not be changed. A
single command or the first of a list of commands shall appear on
the same line as the global command. All lines of a multi-line
list except the last line shall be ended with a backslash preceding
the terminating &lt;newline&gt;; the <B>a</B>, <B>i</B>, and

In the <B>G</B> command, the first step shall be to mark every line
for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;
matches the given RE. Then, for every such line, that line shall be
written, the current line number shall be set to the address of
that line, and any one command (other than one of the <B>a</B>, <B>c</B>,
<B>i</B>, <B>g</B>, <B>G</B>, <B>v</B>, and <B>V</B>
commands) shall be read and executed. A &lt;newline&gt; shall act as a null
command (causing no action to be taken on the current
line); an <B>'&amp;'</B> shall cause the re-execution of the most recent
non-null command executed within the current invocation
of <B>G</B>. Note that the commands input as part of the execution
of the <B>G</B> command can address and affect any lines in the
buffer. Any line modified by the command shall be unmarked. The final
value of the current line number shall be the value set by
the last command successfully executed. (Note that the last command
successfully executed shall be the <B>G</B> command itself if a
command fails or the null command is specified.) If there were no
matching lines, the current line number shall not be changed. The
<B>G</B> command can be terminated by a SIGINT signal. Any character
other than &lt;space&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; can be used
instead of a slash to delimit the RE and the replacement. Within the
RE, the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal character
if it is preceded by a backslash.

The <B>s</B> command shall search each addressed line for an occurrence
of the specified RE and replace either the first or all
(non-overlapped) matched strings with the <I>replacement</I>; see the
following description of the <B>g</B> suffix. It is an error
if the substitution fails on every addressed line. Any character other
than &lt;space&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of
a slash to delimit the RE and the replacement. Within the RE, the
RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal character if it is
preceded by a backslash. The current line shall be set to the address
of the last line on which a substitution occurred.
<P>

An ampersand ( <B>'&amp;'</B> ) appearing in the <I>replacement</I> shall
be replaced by the string matching the RE on the
current line. The special meaning of <B>'&amp;'</B> in this context can
be suppressed by preceding it by backslash. As a more
general feature, the characters <B>'\n'</B>, where <I>n</I> is a digit,
shall be replaced by the text matched by the
corresponding back-reference expression. When the character <B>'%'</B>
is the only character in the <I>replacement</I>, the
<I>replacement</I> used in the most recent substitute command shall
be used as the <I>replacement</I> in the current substitute
command; if there was no previous substitute command, the use of <B>'%'</B>
in this manner shall be an error. The <B>'%'</B>
shall lose its special meaning when it is in a replacement string
of more than one character or is preceded by a backslash. For
each backslash ( <B>'\'</B> ) encountered in scanning <I>replacement</I>
from beginning to end, the following character shall
lose its special meaning (if any). It is unspecified what special
meaning is given to any character other than <B>'&amp;'</B>,
<B>'\'</B>, <B>'%'</B>, or digits.
<P>

A line can be split by substituting a &lt;newline&gt; into it. The application
shall ensure it escapes the &lt;newline&gt; in
the <I>replacement</I> by preceding it by backslash. Such substitution
cannot be done as part of a <B>g</B> or <B>v</B> <I>command
list</I>. The current line number shall be set to the address of the
last line on which a substitution is performed. If no
substitution is performed, the current line number shall be unchanged.
If a line is split, a substitution shall be considered to
have been performed on each of the new lines for the purpose of determining
the new current line number. A substitution shall be
considered to have been performed even if the replacement string is
identical to the string that it replaces.
<P>

The application shall ensure that the value of <I>flags</I> is zero
or more of:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>count</I><DD>
Substitute for the <I>count</I>th occurrence only of the RE found on
each addressed line.

<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

Because of the extremely terse nature of the default error messages,
the prudent script writer begins the <I>ed</I> input

least some clue as to the cause is made available.
<P>

In previous versions, an obsolescent <B>-</B> option was described.
This is no longer specified. Applications should use the
<B>-s</B> option. Using <B>-</B> as a <I>file</I> operand now produces
unspecified results. This allows implementations to continue
to support the former required behavior.

The Version 7 <I>ed</I> command <B>W</B>, and the BSD <I>ed</I> commands
<B>W</B>, <B>wq</B>, and <B>z</B> are not present in
this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The <B>-s</B> option was added to allow the functionality of the now
withdrawn <B>-</B> option in a manner compatible with the
Utility Syntax Guidelines.
<P>

In early proposals there was a limit, {ED_FILE_MAX}, that described
the historical limitations of some <I>ed</I> utilities in
their handling of large files; some of these have had problems with
files larger than 100000 bytes. It was this limitation that
prompted much of the desire to include a <I>split</I> command in this
volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Since this limit was removed, this volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that
implementations document the file size limits imposed by <I>ed</I>
in the conformance document. The limit {ED_LINE_MAX} was also
removed; therefore, the global limit {LINE_MAX} is used for input
and output lines.
<P>

The manner in which the <B>l</B> command writes non-printable characters
was changed to avoid the historical
backspace-overstrike method. On video display terminals, the overstrike
is ambiguous because most terminals simply replace
overstruck characters, making the <B>l</B> format not useful for its
intended purpose of unambiguously understanding the content of
the line. The historical backslash escapes were also ambiguous. (The
string <B>&quot;a\0011&quot;</B> could represent a line containing
those six characters or a line containing the three characters <B>'a'</B>,
a byte with a binary value of 1, and a 1.) In the
format required here, a backslash appearing in the line is written
as <B>&quot;\\&quot;</B> so that the output is truly unambiguous. The
method of marking the ends of lines was adopted from the <I>ex</I>
editor and is required for
any line ending in &lt;space&gt;s; the <B>'$'</B> is placed on all lines
so that a real <B>'$'</B> at the end of a line cannot
be misinterpreted.
<P>

Systems with bytes too large to fit into three octal digits must devise
other means of displaying non-printable characters.
Consideration was given to requiring that the number of octal digits
be large enough to hold a byte, but this seemed to be too
confusing for applications on the vast majority of systems where three
digits are adequate. It would be theoretically possible for
the application to use the <I>getconf</I> utility to find out the CHAR_BIT
value and deal
with such an algorithm; however, there is really no portable way that
an application can use the octal values of the bytes across
various coded character sets, so the additional specification was
not worthwhile.
<P>

The description of how a NUL is written was removed. The NUL character
cannot be in text files, and this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 should not dictate behavior in the case of
undefined, erroneous input.
<P>

Unlike some of the other editing utilities, the filenames accepted
by the <B>E</B>, <B>e</B>, <B>R</B>, and <B>r</B> commands
are not patterns.
<P>

Early proposals stated that the <B>-p</B> option worked only when standard
input was associated with a terminal device. This has
been changed to conform to historical implementations, thereby allowing
applications to interpose themselves between a user and the
<I>ed</I> utility.
<P>

The form of the substitute command that uses the <B>n</B> suffix was
limited in some historical documentation (where this was
described incorrectly as &quot;backreferencing&quot;). This limit has been omitted
because there is no reason why an editor processing
lines of {LINE_MAX} length should have this restriction. The command
<B>s/x/X/2047</B> should be able to substitute the 2047th
occurrence of <B>'x'</B> on a line.
<P>

The use of printing commands with printing suffixes (such as <B>pn</B>,
<B>lp</B>, and so on) was made unspecified because
BSD-based systems allow this, whereas System V does not.
<P>

Some BSD-based systems exit immediately upon receipt of end-of-file
if all of the lines in the file have been deleted. Since
this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 refers to the <B>q</B> command
in this instance, such behavior is not allowed.
<P>

Some historical implementations returned exit status zero even if
command errors had occurred; this is not allowed by this
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
<P>

Some historical implementations contained a bug that allowed a single
period to be entered in input mode as &lt;backslash&gt;
&lt;period&gt; &lt;newline&gt;. This is not allowed by <I>ed</I> because there
is no description of escaping any of the characters
in input mode; backslashes are entered into the buffer exactly as
typed. The typical method of entering a single period has been to
precede it with another character and then use the substitute command
to delete that character.
<P>

It is difficult under some modes of some versions of historical operating
system terminal drivers to distinguish between an
end-of-file condition and terminal disconnect. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not require implementations to distinguish
between the two situations, which permits historical implementations
of the <I>ed</I> utility on historical platforms to conform.
Implementations are encouraged to distinguish between the two, if
possible, and take appropriate action on terminal disconnect.
<P>

Historically, <I>ed</I> accepted a zero address for the <B>a</B> and
<B>r</B> commands in order to insert text at the start of
the edit buffer. When the buffer was empty the command <B>.=</B> returned
zero. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance
to historical practice.
<P>

For consistency with the <B>a</B> and <B>r</B> commands and better user
functionality, the <B>i</B> and <B>c</B> commands must
also accept an address of 0, in which case 0<I>i</I> is treated as
1<I>i</I> and likewise for the <B>c</B> command.
<P>

All of the following are valid addresses:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>+++</B><DD>
Three lines after the current line.
<DT><B>/</B><I>pattern</I><B>/-</B><DD>
One line before the next occurrence of pattern.
<DT><B>-2</B><DD>
Two lines before the current line.
<DT><B>3&nbsp;----&nbsp;2</B><DD>
Line one (note the intermediate negative address).
<DT><B>1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3</B><DD>
Line six.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

Any number of addresses can be provided to commands taking addresses;
for example, <B>&quot;1,2,3,4,5p&quot;</B> prints lines 4 and 5,
because two is the greatest valid number of addresses accepted by
the <B>print</B> command. This, in combination with the semicolon
delimiter, permits users to create commands based on ordered patterns
in the file. For example, the command <B>&quot;3;/foo/;+2p&quot;</B>
will display the first line after line 3 that contains the pattern
<I>foo</I>, plus the next two lines. Note that the address
<B>&quot;3;&quot;</B> must still be evaluated before being discarded, because
the search origin for the <B>&quot;/foo/&quot;</B> command depends on
this.
<P>

Historically, <I>ed</I> disallowed address chains, as discussed above,
consisting solely of comma or semicolon separators; for
example, <B>&quot;,,,&quot;</B> or <B>&quot;;;;&quot;</B> were considered an error. For
consistency of address specification, this restriction is
removed. The following table lists some of the address forms now possible:

<P>

Historically, values could be added to addresses by including them
after one or more &lt;blank&gt;s; for example,
<B>&quot;3&nbsp;-&nbsp;5p&quot;</B> wrote the seventh line of the file, and <B>&quot;/foo/&nbsp;5&quot;</B>
was the same as <B>&quot;5&nbsp;/foo/&quot;</B>
. However, only absolute values could be added; for example, <B>&quot;5&nbsp;/foo/&quot;</B>
was an error. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires conformance to historical practice.
<P>

Historically, <I>ed</I> accepted the <B>'^'</B> character as an address,
in which case it was identical to the hyphen
character. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not require or prohibit this
behavior.
