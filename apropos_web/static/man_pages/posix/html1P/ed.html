<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>  <b>ed</b> <b>[</b><b>-p</b> <i>string</i><b>][</b><b>-s</b><b>][</b><i>file</i><b>]</b></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>ed</i> utility is a line-oriented text editor that uses two modes:  <i>command mode</i> and <i>input mode</i>. In command mode the input characters shall be interpreted as commands, and in input mode they shall be interpreted as text. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> The  <i>ed</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.<div class="spacer">

<h1>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h1> The  <i>ed</i> utility shall take the standard action for all signals (see the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section in  <i>Utility Description Defaults</i> ) with the following exceptions:<dl>
<dt>
SIGINT</dt>
<dd>
The <i>ed</i> utility shall interrupt its current activity, write the string  <b>&quot;?\n&quot;</b> to standard output, and return to command mode (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
SIGHUP</dt>
<dd>
If the buffer is not empty and has changed since the last write, the  <i>ed</i> utility shall attempt to write a copy of the buffer in a file. First, the file named  <b>ed.hup</b> in the current directory shall be used; if that fails, the file named  <b>ed.hup</b> in the directory named by the <i>HOME</i> environment variable shall be used. In any case, the  <i>ed</i> utility shall exit without returning to command mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
SIGQUIT</dt>
<dd>
The <i>ed</i> utility shall ignore this event.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>STDOUT</h1> Various editing commands and the prompting feature (see  <b>-p</b>) write to standard output, as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>STDERR</h1> The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OUTPUT FILES</h1> The output files shall be text files whose formats are dependent on the editing commands given.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>ed</i> utility shall operate on a copy of the file it is editing; changes made to the copy shall have no effect on the file until a  <b>w</b> (write) command is given. The copy of the text is called the  <i>buffer</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Commands to <i>ed</i> have a simple and regular structure: zero, one, or two  <i>addresses</i> followed by a single-character  <i>command</i>, possibly followed by parameters to that command. These addresses specify one or more lines in the buffer. Every command that requires addresses has default addresses, so that the addresses very often can be omitted. If the  <b>-p</b> option is specified, the prompt string shall be written to standard output before each command is read.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In general, only one command can appear on a line. Certain commands allow text to be input. This text is placed in the appropriate place in the buffer. While  <i>ed</i> is accepting text, it is said to be in  <i>input mode</i>. In this mode, no commands shall be recognized; all input is merely collected. Input mode is terminated by entering a line consisting of two characters: a period (  <b>'.'</b> ) followed by a &lt;newline&gt;. This line is not considered part of the input text.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Regular Expressions in ed</h2> The  <i>ed</i> utility shall support basic regular expressions, as described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Section 9.3, Basic Regular Expressions. Since regular expressions in  <i>ed</i> are always matched against single lines (excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;s), never against any larger section of text, there is no way for a regular expression to match a &lt;newline&gt;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A null RE shall be equivalent to the last RE encountered.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Regular expressions are used in addresses to specify lines, and in some commands (for example, the  <b>s</b> substitute command) to specify portions of a line to be substituted.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Addresses in ed</h2> Addressing in  <i>ed</i> relates to the current line. Generally, the current line is the last line affected by a command. The current line number is the address of the current line. If the edit buffer is not empty, the initial value for the current line shall be the last line in the edit buffer; otherwise, zero.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Addresses shall be constructed as follows:<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
The period character ( <b>'.'</b> ) shall address the current line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
The dollar sign character ( <b>'$'</b> ) shall address the last line of the edit buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 3.</dt>
<dd>
The positive decimal number <i>n</i> shall address the <i>n</i>th line of the edit buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 4.</dt>
<dd>
The apostrophe-x character pair ( <b>&quot;'x&quot;</b> ) shall address the line marked with the mark name character  <i>x</i>, which shall be a lowercase letter from the portable character set. It shall be an error if the character has not been set to mark a line or if the line that was marked is not currently present in the edit buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 5.</dt>
<dd>
A BRE enclosed by slash characters ( <b>'/'</b> ) shall address the first line found by searching forwards from the line following the current line toward the end of the edit buffer and stopping at the first line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the BRE. The BRE consisting of a null BRE delimited by a pair of slash characters shall address the next line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last BRE encountered. In addition, the second slash can be omitted at the end of a command line. Within the BRE, a backslash-slash pair (  <b>&quot;\/&quot;</b> ) shall represent a literal slash instead of the BRE delimiter. If necessary, the search shall wrap around to the beginning of the buffer and continue up to and including the current line, so that the entire buffer is searched.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 6.</dt>
<dd>
A BRE enclosed by question-mark characters ( <b>'?'</b> ) shall address the first line found by searching backwards from the line preceding the current line toward the beginning of the edit buffer and stopping at the first line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the BRE. The BRE consisting of a null BRE delimited by a pair of question-mark characters (  <b>&quot;??&quot;</b> ) shall address the previous line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last BRE encountered. In addition, the second question-mark can be omitted at the end of a command line. Within the BRE, a backslash-question-mark pair (  <b>&quot;\?&quot;</b> ) shall represent a literal question mark instead of the BRE delimiter. If necessary, the search shall wrap around to the end of the buffer and continue up to and including the current line, so that the entire buffer is searched.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 7.</dt>
<dd>
A plus-sign ( <b>'+'</b> ) or hyphen character ( <b>'-'</b> ) followed by a decimal number shall address the current line plus or minus the number. A plus-sign or hyphen character not followed by a decimal number shall address the current line plus or minus 1.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Addresses can be followed by zero or more address offsets, optionally &lt;blank&gt;-separated. Address offsets are constructed as follows:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
A plus-sign or hyphen character followed by a decimal number shall add or subtract, respectively, the indicated number of lines to or from the address. A plus-sign or hyphen character not followed by a decimal number shall add or subtract 1 to or from the address.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
A decimal number shall add the indicated number of lines to the address.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It shall not be an error for an intermediate address value to be less than zero or greater than the last line in the edit buffer. It shall be an error for the final address value to be less than zero or greater than the last line in the edit buffer. It shall be an error if a search for a BRE fails to find a matching line.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Commands accept zero, one, or two addresses. If more than the required number of addresses are provided to a command that requires zero addresses, it shall be an error. Otherwise, if more than the required number of addresses are provided to a command, the addresses specified first shall be evaluated and then discarded until the maximum number of valid addresses remain, for the specified command.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Addresses shall be separated from each other by a comma ( <b>','</b> ) or semicolon character (  <b>';'</b> ). In the case of a semicolon separator, the current line (  <b>'.'</b> ) shall be set to the first address, and only then will the second address be calculated. This feature can be used to determine the starting line for forwards and backwards searches; see rules 5. and 6.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Addresses can be omitted on either side of the comma or semicolon separator, in which case the resulting address pairs shall be as follows:<table class="tbl">
<col style="width: 15.00ex;"/>
<col style="width: 15.00ex;"/>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Commands in ed</h2> In the following list of  <i>ed</i> commands, the default addresses are shown in parentheses. The number of addresses shown in the default shall be the number expected by the command. The parentheses are not part of the address; they show that the given addresses are the default.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is generally invalid for more than one command to appear on a line. However, any command (except  <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>,  <b>f</b>, <b>q</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>w</b>, and <b>!</b>) can be suffixed by the letter  <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b>; in which case, except for the  <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, and <b>p</b> commands, the command shall be executed and then the new current line shall be written as described below under the  <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, and  <b>p</b> commands. When an <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b> suffix is used with an  <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b> command, the command shall write to standard output as described below, but it is unspecified whether the suffix writes the current line again in the requested format or whether the suffix has no effect. For example, the  <b>pl</b> command (base <b>p</b> command with an <b>l</b> suffix) shall either write just the current line or write it twice-once as specified for  <b>p</b> and once as specified for <b>l</b>. Also, the  <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>v</b>, and <b>V</b> commands shall take a command as a parameter.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each address component can be preceded by zero or more &lt;blank&gt;s. The command letter can be preceded by zero or more &lt;blank&gt;s. If a suffix letter (  <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b>) is given, the application shall ensure that it immediately follows the command.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>w</b> commands shall take an optional  <i>file</i> parameter, separated from the command letter by one or more &lt;blank&gt;s.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If changes have been made in the buffer since the last <b>w</b> command that wrote the entire buffer,  <i>ed</i> shall warn the user if an attempt is made to destroy the editor buffer via the  <b>e</b> or  <b>q</b> commands. The <i>ed</i> utility shall write the string:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

If the buffer is not empty and has changed since the last write, the  <i>ed</i> utility shall attempt to write a copy of the buffer to a file named  <b>ed.hup</b> in the current directory. If this write fails,  <i>ed</i> shall attempt to write a copy of the buffer to a filename  <b>ed.hup</b> in the directory named by the <i>HOME</i> environment variable. If both these attempts fail,  <i>ed</i> shall exit without saving the buffer.</dd>

The <i>ed</i> utility shall not write the file to the currently remembered pathname or return to command mode, and shall terminate with a non-zero exit status.</dd>

If an end-of-file is detected on standard input:<dl>

In the <b>G</b> command, the first step shall be to mark every line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the given RE. Then, for every such line, that line shall be written, the current line number shall be set to the address of that line, and any one command (other than one of the  <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>,  <b>i</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>v</b>, and <b>V</b> commands) shall be read and executed.

The <b>s</b> command shall search each addressed line for an occurrence of the specified RE and replace either the first or all (non-overlapped) matched strings with the  <i>replacement</i>; see the following description of the  <b>g</b> suffix. It is an error if the substitution fails on every addressed line. Any character other than &lt;space&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of a slash to delimit the RE and the replacement. Within the RE, the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal character if it is preceded by a backslash. The current line shall be set to the address of the last line on which a substitution occurred.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An ampersand ( <b>'&amp;'</b> ) appearing in the <i>replacement</i> shall be replaced by the string matching the RE on the current line. The special meaning of  <b>'&amp;'</b> in this context can be suppressed by preceding it by backslash. As a more general feature, the characters  <b>'\n'</b>, where <i>n</i> is a digit, shall be replaced by the text matched by the corresponding back-reference expression. When the character  <b>'%'</b> is the only character in the  <i>replacement</i>, the  <i>replacement</i> used in the most recent substitute command shall be used as the  <i>replacement</i> in the current substitute command; if there was no previous substitute command, the use of  <b>'%'</b> in this manner shall be an error. The  <b>'%'</b> shall lose its special meaning when it is in a replacement string of more than one character or is preceded by a backslash. For each backslash (  <b>'\'</b> ) encountered in scanning <i>replacement</i> from beginning to end, the following character shall lose its special meaning (if any). It is unspecified what special meaning is given to any character other than  <b>'&amp;'</b>,  <b>'\'</b>, <b>'%'</b>, or digits.<div class="spacer">

A line can be split by substituting a &lt;newline&gt; into it. The application shall ensure it escapes the &lt;newline&gt; in the  <i>replacement</i> by preceding it by backslash. Such substitution cannot be done as part of a  <b>g</b> or <b>v</b> <i>command</i>  <i>list</i>. The current line number shall be set to the address of the last line on which a substitution is performed. If no substitution is performed, the current line number shall be unchanged. If a line is split, a substitution shall be considered to have been performed on each of the new lines for the purpose of determining the new current line number. A substitution shall be considered to have been performed even if the replacement string is identical to the string that it replaces.<div class="spacer">

<dd>
If the standard input is a terminal device file, all input shall be flushed, and a new command read.</dd>

<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> Because of the extremely terse nature of the default error messages, the prudent script writer begins the  <i>ed</i> input commands with an  <b>H</b> command, so that if any errors do occur at least some clue as to the cause is made available.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In previous versions, an obsolescent <b>-</b> option was described. This is no longer specified. Applications should use the  <b>-s</b> option. Using <b>-</b> as a <i>file</i> operand now produces unspecified results. This allows implementations to continue to support the former required behavior.</div>

<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-s</b> option was added to allow the functionality of the now withdrawn  <b>-</b> option in a manner compatible with the Utility Syntax Guidelines.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In early proposals there was a limit, {ED_FILE_MAX}, that described the historical limitations of some  <i>ed</i> utilities in their handling of large files; some of these have had problems with files larger than 100000 bytes. It was this limitation that prompted much of the desire to include a  <i>split</i> command in this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001. Since this limit was removed, this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 requires that implementations document the file size limits imposed by  <i>ed</i> in the conformance document. The limit {ED_LINE_MAX} was also removed; therefore, the global limit {LINE_MAX} is used for input and output lines.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The manner in which the <b>l</b> command writes non-printable characters was changed to avoid the historical backspace-overstrike method. On video display terminals, the overstrike is ambiguous because most terminals simply replace overstruck characters, making the  <b>l</b> format not useful for its intended purpose of unambiguously understanding the content of the line. The historical backslash escapes were also ambiguous. (The string  <b>&quot;a\0011&quot;</b> could represent a line containing those six characters or a line containing the three characters  <b>'a'</b>, a byte with a binary value of 1, and a 1.) In the format required here, a backslash appearing in the line is written as  <b>&quot;\\&quot;</b> so that the output is truly unambiguous. The method of marking the ends of lines was adopted from the  <i>ex</i> editor and is required for any line ending in &lt;space&gt;s; the  <b>'$'</b> is placed on all lines so that a real  <b>'$'</b> at the end of a line cannot be misinterpreted.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Systems with bytes too large to fit into three octal digits must devise other means of displaying non-printable characters. Consideration was given to requiring that the number of octal digits be large enough to hold a byte, but this seemed to be too confusing for applications on the vast majority of systems where three digits are adequate. It would be theoretically possible for the application to use the  <i>getconf</i> utility to find out the CHAR_BIT value and deal with such an algorithm; however, there is really no portable way that an application can use the octal values of the bytes across various coded character sets, so the additional specification was not worthwhile.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The description of how a NUL is written was removed. The NUL character cannot be in text files, and this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 should not dictate behavior in the case of undefined, erroneous input.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unlike some of the other editing utilities, the filenames accepted by the  <b>E</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>R</b>, and <b>r</b> commands are not patterns.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Early proposals stated that the <b>-p</b> option worked only when standard input was associated with a terminal device. This has been changed to conform to historical implementations, thereby allowing applications to interpose themselves between a user and the  <i>ed</i> utility.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The form of the substitute command that uses the <b>n</b> suffix was limited in some historical documentation (where this was described incorrectly as &quot;backreferencing&quot;). This limit has been omitted because there is no reason why an editor processing lines of {LINE_MAX} length should have this restriction. The command  <b>s/x/X/2047</b> should be able to substitute the 2047th occurrence of  <b>'x'</b> on a line.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The use of printing commands with printing suffixes (such as <b>pn</b>,  <b>lp</b>, and so on) was made unspecified because BSD-based systems allow this, whereas System V does not.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some BSD-based systems exit immediately upon receipt of end-of-file if all of the lines in the file have been deleted. Since this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 refers to the  <b>q</b> command in this instance, such behavior is not allowed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some historical implementations returned exit status zero even if command errors had occurred; this is not allowed by this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some historical implementations contained a bug that allowed a single period to be entered in input mode as &lt;backslash&gt; &lt;period&gt; &lt;newline&gt;. This is not allowed by  <i>ed</i> because there is no description of escaping any of the characters in input mode; backslashes are entered into the buffer exactly as typed. The typical method of entering a single period has been to precede it with another character and then use the substitute command to delete that character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is difficult under some modes of some versions of historical operating system terminal drivers to distinguish between an end-of-file condition and terminal disconnect. IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 does not require implementations to distinguish between the two situations, which permits historical implementations of the  <i>ed</i> utility on historical platforms to conform. Implementations are encouraged to distinguish between the two, if possible, and take appropriate action on terminal disconnect.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Historically, <i>ed</i> accepted a zero address for the <b>a</b> and  <b>r</b> commands in order to insert text at the start of the edit buffer. When the buffer was empty the command  <b>.=</b> returned zero. IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to historical practice.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For consistency with the <b>a</b> and <b>r</b> commands and better user functionality, the  <b>i</b> and <b>c</b> commands must also accept an address of 0, in which case 0 <i>i</i> is treated as 1 <i>i</i> and likewise for the <b>c</b> command.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All of the following are valid addresses:<dl>
<dt>
<b>+++</b></dt>
<dd>
Three lines after the current line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>/</b><i>pattern</i><b>/-</b></dt>
<dd>
One line before the next occurrence of pattern.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-2</b></dt>
<dd>
Two lines before the current line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>3&#160;----&#160;2</b></dt>
<dd>
Line one (note the intermediate negative address).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>1&#160;2&#160;3</b></dt>
<dd>
Line six.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any number of addresses can be provided to commands taking addresses; for example,  <b>&quot;1,2,3,4,5p&quot;</b> prints lines 4 and 5, because two is the greatest valid number of addresses accepted by the  <b>print</b> command. This, in combination with the semicolon delimiter, permits users to create commands based on ordered patterns in the file. For example, the command  <b>&quot;3;/foo/;+2p&quot;</b> will display the first line after line 3 that contains the pattern  <i>foo</i>, plus the next two lines. Note that the address  <b>&quot;3;&quot;</b> must still be evaluated before being discarded, because the search origin for the  <b>&quot;/foo/&quot;</b> command depends on this.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Historically, <i>ed</i> disallowed address chains, as discussed above, consisting solely of comma or semicolon separators; for example,  <b>&quot;,,,&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;;;;&quot;</b> were considered an error. For consistency of address specification, this restriction is removed. The following table lists some of the address forms now possible:<table class="tbl">
<col style="width: 13.00ex;"/>
<col style="width: 11.00ex;"/>
<col style="width: 11.00ex;"/>
<col style="width: 12.00ex;"/>

Historically, values could be added to addresses by including them after one or more &lt;blank&gt;s; for example,  <b>&quot;3&#160;-&#160;5p&quot;</b> wrote the seventh line of the file, and <b>&quot;/foo/&#160;5&quot;</b> was the same as  <b>&quot;5&#160;/foo/&quot;</b> . However, only absolute values could be added; for example,  <b>&quot;5&#160;/foo/&quot;</b> was an error. IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to historical practice.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Historically, <i>ed</i> accepted the <b>'^'</b> character as an address, in which case it was identical to the hyphen character. IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 does not require or prohibit this behavior.</div>
