<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

This utility shall be provided on systems that both support the User
Portability Utilities option and define the
POSIX2_CHAR_TERM symbol. On other systems it is optional.
<P>

The <I>vi</I> (visual) utility is a screen-oriented text editor. Only
the open and visual modes of the editor are described in
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001; see the line editor <I>ex</I> for additional
editing
capabilities used in <I>vi</I>. The user can switch back and forth
between <I>vi</I> and <I>ex</I> and execute <I>ex</I> commands from within
<I>vi</I>.
<P>

This reference page uses the term <I>edit buffer</I> to describe the
current working text. No specific implementation is implied
by this term. All editing changes are performed on the edit buffer,
and no changes to it shall affect any file until an editor
command writes the file.
<P>

When using <I>vi</I>, the terminal screen acts as a window into the
editing buffer. Changes made to the editing buffer shall be
reflected in the screen display; the position of the cursor on the
screen shall indicate the position within the editing
buffer.
<P>

Certain terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to support
the complete <I>vi</I> definition. When these commands
cannot be supported on such terminals, this condition shall not produce
an error message such as &quot;not an editor command&quot; or
report a syntax error. The implementation may either accept the commands
and produce results on the screen that are the result of
an unsuccessful attempt to meet the requirements of this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 or report an error describing the
terminal-related deficiency.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The <I>vi</I> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
<P>

The following options shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-c&nbsp;</B> <I>command</I><DD>
See the <I>ex</I> command description of the <B>-c</B> option.
<DT><B>-r</B><DD>
See the <I>ex</I> command description of the <B>-r</B> option.
<DT><B>-R</B><DD>
See the <I>ex</I> command description of the <B>-R</B> option.
<DT><B>-t&nbsp;</B> <I>tagstring</I><DD>
See the <I>ex</I> command description of the <B>-t</B> option.
<DT><B>-w&nbsp;</B> <I>size</I><DD>
See the <I>ex</I> command description of the <B>-w</B> option.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPERANDS</H2>

<P>

See the OPERANDS section of the <I>ex</I> command for a description
of the operands supported
by the <I>vi</I> command.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDIN</H2>

<P>

If standard input is not a terminal device, the results are undefined.
The standard input consists of a series of commands and
input text, as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
<P>

If a read from the standard input returns an error, or if the editor
detects an end-of-file condition from the standard input,
it shall be equivalent to a SIGHUP asynchronous event.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

See the INPUT FILES section of the <I>ex</I> command for a description
of the input files
supported by the <I>vi</I> command.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<P>

See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section of the <I>ex</I> command for
the environment variables
that affect the execution of the <I>vi</I> command.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</H2>

<P>

See the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section of the <I>ex</I> for the asynchronous
events that affect
the execution of the <I>vi</I> command.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDOUT</H2>

<P>

If standard output is not a terminal device, undefined results occur.
<P>

Standard output may be used for writing prompts to the user, for informational
messages, and for writing lines from the
file.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDERR</H2>

<P>

If standard output is not a terminal device, undefined results occur.
<P>

The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OUTPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

See the OUTPUT FILES section of the <I>ex</I> command for a description
of the output files
supported by the <I>vi</I> command.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

If the terminal does not have the capabilities necessary to support
an unspecified portion of the <I>vi</I> definition,
implementations shall start initially in <I>ex</I> mode or open mode.
Otherwise, after
initialization, <I>vi</I> shall be in command mode; text input mode
can be entered by one of several commands used to insert or
change text. In text input mode, &lt;ESC&gt; can be used to return to command
mode; other uses of &lt;ESC&gt; are described later
in this section; see Terminate Command or Input Mode .
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Initialization in ex and vi</H3>

<P>

See <I>Initialization in ex and vi</I> for a description of <I>ex</I>
and <I>vi</I> initialization for the <I>vi</I> utility.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Command Descriptions in vi</H3>

<P>

The following symbols are used in this reference page to represent
arguments to commands.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>buffer</I><DD>
See the description of <I>buffer</I> in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section
of the <I>ex</I>
utility; see <I>Command Descriptions in ex</I> . 
</DL>
<P>

In open and visual mode, when a command synopsis shows both [ <I>buffer</I>]
and [ <I>count</I>] preceding the command name,
they can be specified in either order.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>count</I><DD>
A positive integer used as an optional argument to most commands,
either to give a repeat count or as a size. This argument is
optional and shall default to 1 unless otherwise specified. 
</DL>
<P>

The Synopsis lines for the <I>vi</I> commands &lt;control&gt;-G, &lt;control&gt;-L,
&lt;control&gt;-R, &lt;control&gt;-],
<B>%</B>, <B>&amp;</B>, <B>^</B>, <B>D</B>, <B>m</B>, <B>M</B>, <B>Q</B>, <B>u</B>,
<B>U</B>, and <B>ZZ</B> do not have
<I>count</I> as an optional argument. Regardless, it shall not be an
error to specify a <I>count</I> to these commands, and any
specified <I>count</I> shall be ignored.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>motion</I><DD>
An optional trailing argument used by the <B>!</B>, <B>&lt;</B>, <B>&gt;</B>,
<B>c</B>, <B>d</B>, and <B>y</B> commands, which
is used to indicate the region of text that shall be affected by the
command. The motion can be either one of the command
characters repeated or one of several other <I>vi</I> commands (listed
in the following table). Each of the applicable commands
specifies the region of text matched by repeating the command; each
command that can be used as a motion command specifies the
region of text it affects. 
</DL>
<P>

Commands that take <I>motion</I> arguments operate on either lines
or characters, depending on the circumstances. When operating
on lines, all lines that fall partially or wholly within the text
region specified for the command shall be affected. When
operating on characters, only the exact characters in the specified
text region shall be affected. Each motion command specifies
this individually.
<P>

When commands that may be motion commands are not used as motion commands,
they shall set the current position to the current
line and column as specified.
<P>

The following commands shall be valid cursor motion commands:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>&lt;apostrophe&gt;       (    -    j    H
&lt;carriage-return&gt;  )    $    k    L
&lt;comma&gt;            [[   %    l    M
&lt;control&gt;-H        ]]   _    n    N
&lt;control&gt;-N        {    ;    t    T
&lt;control&gt;-P        }    ?    w    W
&lt;grave accent&gt;     ^    b    B
&lt;newline&gt;          +    e    E
&lt;space&gt;            |    f    F
&lt;zero&gt;             /    h    G
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Any <I>count</I> that is specified to a command that has an associated
motion command shall be applied to the motion command. If
a <I>count</I> is applied to both the command and its associated motion
command, the effect shall be multiplicative.
<P>
<P>

The following symbols are used in this section to specify locations
in the edit buffer:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>current&nbsp;character</I><DD>
<P>
The character that is currently indicated by the cursor.
<DT><I>end&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;line</I><DD>

</DL>
<P>

<P>
</DL>
<P>

In the remainder of the description of the <I>vi</I> utility, the term
&quot;buffer line&quot; refers to a line in the edit buffer and
the term &quot;display line&quot; refers to the line or lines on the display
screen used to display one buffer line. The term &quot;current
line&quot; refers to a specific &quot;buffer line&quot;.
<P>

If there are display lines on the screen for which there are no corresponding
buffer lines because they correspond to lines that
would be after the end of the file, they shall be displayed as a single
tilde ( <B>'~'</B> ) character, plus the terminating
&lt;newline&gt;.
<P>

The last line of the screen shall be used to report errors or display
informational messages. It shall also be used to display
the input for &quot;line-oriented commands&quot; ( <B>/</B>, <B>?</B>, <B>:</B>,
and <B>!</B>). When a line-oriented command is executed,
the editor shall enter text input mode on the last line on the screen,
using the respective command characters as prompt
characters. (In the case of the <B>!</B> command, the associated motion
shall be entered by the user before the editor enters text
input mode.) The line entered by the user shall be terminated by a
&lt;newline&gt;, a non- &lt;control&gt;-V-escaped
&lt;carriage-return&gt;, or unescaped &lt;ESC&gt;. It is unspecified if more characters
than require a display width minus one
column number of screen columns can be entered.
<P>

If any command is executed that overwrites a portion of the screen
other than the last line of the screen (for example, the <I>ex</I>
<B>suspend</B> or <B>!</B> commands), other than the <I>ex</I> <B>shell</B>
command, the user shall be prompted for a character before the screen
is
refreshed and the edit session continued.
<P>

&lt;tab&gt;s shall take up the number of columns on the screen set by the
<B>tabstop</B> edit option (see <I>ed</I>), unless there are less than
that number of columns before the display margin that will cause
the displayed line to be folded; in this case, they shall only take
up the number of columns up to that boundary.
<P>

The cursor shall be placed on the current line and relative to the
current column as specified by each command described in the
following sections.
<P>

In open mode, if the current line is not already displayed, then it
shall be displayed.
<P>

In visual mode, if the current line is not displayed, then the lines
that are displayed shall be expanded, scrolled, or redrawn
to cause an unspecified portion of the current line to be displayed.
If the screen is redrawn, no more than the number of display
lines specified by the value of the <B>window</B> edit option shall
be displayed (unless the current line cannot be completely
displayed in the number of display lines specified by the <B>window</B>
edit option) and the current line shall be positioned as
close to the center of the displayed lines as possible (within the
constraints imposed by the distance of the line from the
beginning or end of the edit buffer). If the current line is before
the first line in the display and the screen is scrolled, an
unspecified portion of the current line shall be placed on the first
line of the display. If the current line is after the last
line in the display and the screen is scrolled, an unspecified portion
of the current line shall be placed on the last line of the
display.
<P>

In visual mode, if a line from the edit buffer (other than the current
line) does not entirely fit into the lines at the bottom
of the display that are available for its presentation, the editor
may choose not to display any portion of the line. The lines of
the display that do not contain text from the edit buffer for this
reason shall each consist of a single <B>'@'</B>
character.
<P>

In visual mode, the editor may choose for unspecified reasons to not
update lines in the display to correspond to the underlying
edit buffer text. The lines of the display that do not correctly correspond
to text from the edit buffer for this reason shall
consist of a single <B>'@'</B> character (plus the terminating &lt;newline&gt;),
and the &lt;control&gt;-R command shall cause
the editor to update the screen to correctly represent the edit buffer.
<P>

Open and visual mode commands that set the current column set it to
a column position in the display, and not a character
position in the line. In this case, however, the column position in
the display shall be calculated for an infinite width display;
for example, the column related to a character that is part of a line
that has been folded onto additional screen lines will be
offset from the display line column where the buffer line begins,
not from the beginning of a particular display line.
<P>

The display cursor column in the display is based on the value of
the current column, as follows, with each rule applied in
turn:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
If the current column is after the last display line column used by
the displayed line, the display cursor column shall be set
to the last display line column occupied by the last non- &lt;newline&gt;
in the current line; otherwise, the display cursor column
shall be set to the current column.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
If the character of which some portion is displayed in the display
line column specified by the display cursor column requires
more than a single display line column:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> a.<DD>
If in text input mode, the display cursor column shall be adjusted
to the first display line column in which any portion of that
character is displayed.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> b.<DD>
Otherwise, the display cursor column shall be adjusted to the last
display line column in which any portion of that character is
displayed.
</DL>
<P>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

<P>

The current column shall not be changed by these adjustments to the
display cursor column.
<P>

If an error occurs during the parsing or execution of a <I>vi</I> command:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
The terminal shall be alerted. Execution of the <I>vi</I> command shall
stop, and the cursor (for example, the current line and
column) shall not be further modified.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
Unless otherwise specified by the following command sections, it is
unspecified whether an informational message shall be
displayed.

<P>

<DL COMPACT>

If the <I>vi</I> command resulted from a <B>map</B> expansion, all characters
from that <B>map</B> expansion shall be discarded,
except as otherwise specified by the <B>map</B> command (see <I>ed</I>).
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> *<DD>
If the <I>vi</I> command resulted from the execution of a buffer, no

If the regular expression is not the last regular expression on the

An optional address offset (see <I>Addressing in ex</I> ) can be specified
after the last
regular expression by including a trailing <B>'/'</B> character after
the regular expression and specifying the address offset.
This offset will be from the line containing the match for the last
regular expression specified. It shall be an error if the line
offset would indicate a line address less than 1 or greater than the
last line in the edit buffer. An address offset of zero shall
be supported. It shall be an error to follow the address offset with
any other characters than &lt;blank&gt;s.

If not used as a motion command, an optional <B>z</B> command (see

<B>autoindent</B> characters

<B>autoindent</B> characters shall be automatically inserted into each
line that is created in text input mode, either as a
result of entering a &lt;newline&gt; or &lt;carriage-return&gt; while in text
input mode, or as an effect of the command itself;
for example, <B>O</B> or <B>o</B> (see the <I>ex</I> <B>autoindent</B>
command), as if entered
by the user.
<P>

It shall be possible to erase <B>autoindent</B> characters with the
&lt;control&gt;-D command; it is unspecified whether they
can be erased by &lt;control&gt;-H, &lt;control&gt;-U, and &lt;control&gt;-W characters.
Erasing any <B>autoindent</B> character
turns the glyph into erase-columns and deletes the character from
the edit buffer, but does not change its representation on the
screen.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
Text input characters
</DL>
<P>

Text input characters are the characters entered by the user. Erasing
any text input character turns the glyph into
erase-columns and deletes the character from the edit buffer, but
does not change its representation on the screen.
<P>

Each text input character entered by the user (that does not have
a special meaning) shall be treated as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> a.<DD>
The text input character shall be appended to the last character in
the edit buffer from the first, second, or third
categories.
</DL>

If there are no erase-columns on the screen, the text input command
was the <B>R</B> command, and characters in the fifth
category from the original line follow the cursor, the next such character
shall be deleted from the edit buffer. If the
<B>slowopen</B> edit option is not set, the corresponding glyph on
the screen shall become erase-columns.
</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> c.<DD>
If there are erase-columns on the screen, as many columns as they
occupy, or as are necessary, shall be overwritten to display
the text input character. (If only part of a multi-column glyph is
overwritten, the remainder shall be left on the screen, and
continue to be treated as erase-columns; it is unspecified whether
the remainder of the glyph is modified in any way.)

Erase-columns

Erase-columns are not logically part of the edit buffer, appearing
only on the screen, and may be overwritten on the screen by
subsequent text input characters. When text input mode ends, all erase-columns
shall no longer appear on the screen.
<P>

Erase-columns are initially the region of text specified by the <B>c</B>
command (see Change );
however, erasing <B>autoindent</B> or text input characters causes
the glyphs of the erased characters to be treated as
erase-columns.

text input command, or as &lt;blank&gt;s deleted when a &lt;newline&gt; or &lt;carriage-return&gt;
is entered.
<P>

<P>

It is unspecified whether it is an error to attempt to erase past
the beginning of a line that was created by the entry of a
&lt;newline&gt; or &lt;carriage-return&gt; during text input mode. If it is not
an error, the editor shall behave as if the erasing
character was entered immediately after the last text input character
entered on the previous line, and all of the non-
&lt;newline&gt;s on the current line shall be treated as erase-columns.
<P>

When text input mode is entered, or after a text input mode character
is entered (except as specified for the special characters
below), the cursor shall be positioned as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
On the first column that displays any part of the first erase-column,
if one exists
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>

The characters that are updated on the screen during text input mode

terminal, or a terminal without any form of cursor addressing, thus
it is not a mandatory requirement that such features should
work on all terminals. It is the intention, however, that a <I>vi</I>
implementation should provide the full set of capabilities on
all terminals capable of supporting them.
<P>

Historically, <I>vi</I> exited immediately if the standard input was
not a terminal. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits, but
does not require, this behavior. An end-of-file condition is not equivalent
to an end-of-file character. A common end-of-file
character, &lt;control&gt;-D, is historically a <I>vi</I> command.
<P>

The text in the STDOUT section reflects the usage of the verb <I>display</I>
in this section; some implementations of <I>vi</I>
use standard output to write to the terminal, but IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not require that to be the case.
<P>

Historically, implementations reverted to open mode if the terminal
was incapable of supporting full visual mode.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires this behavior. Historically, the open
mode of <I>vi</I> behaved roughly equivalently to the
visual mode, with the exception that only a single line from the edit
buffer (one &quot;buffer line&quot;) was kept current at any time.
This line was normally displayed on the next-to-last line of a terminal
with cursor addressing (and the last line performed its
normal visual functions for line-oriented commands and messages).
In addition, some few commands behaved differently in open mode
than in visual mode. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.
<P>

Historically, <I>ex</I> and <I>vi</I> implementations have expected
text to proceed in the
usual European/Latin order of left to right, top to bottom. There
is no requirement in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 that this be
the case. The specification was deliberately written using words like
&quot;before&quot;, &quot;after&quot;, &quot;first&quot;, and &quot;last&quot; in order to
permit implementations to support the natural text order of the language.
<P>

Historically, lines past the end of the edit buffer were marked with
single tilde ( <B>'~'</B> ) characters; that is, if
the one-based display was 20 lines in length, and the last line of
the file was on line one, then lines 2-20 would contain only a
single <B>'~'</B> character.
<P>

Historically, the <I>vi</I> editor attempted to display only complete
lines at the bottom of the screen (it did display partial
lines at the top of the screen). If a line was too long to fit in
its entirety at the bottom of the screen, the screen lines where
the line would have been displayed were displayed as single <B>'@'</B>
characters, instead of displaying part of the line.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits, but does not require, this behavior.
Implementations are encouraged to attempt always to
display a complete line at the bottom of the screen when doing scrolling
or screen positioning by buffer lines.
<P>

Historically, lines marked with <B>'@'</B> were also used to minimize
output to dumb terminals over slow lines; that is,
changes local to the cursor were updated, but changes to lines on
the screen that were not close to the cursor were simply marked
with an <B>'@'</B> sign instead of being updated to match the current
text. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits, but does not
require this feature because it is used ever less frequently as terminals
become smarter and connections are faster.
<A NAME="lbEN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Initialization in ex and vi</H3>

<P>

Historically, <I>vi</I> always had a line in the edit buffer, even
if the edit buffer was &quot;empty&quot;. For example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
The <I>ex</I> command <B>=</B> executed from visual mode wrote &quot;1&quot; when
the buffer was
empty.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
Writes from visual mode of an empty edit buffer wrote files of a single
character (a &lt;newline&gt;), while writes from <I>ex</I> mode of an empty
edit buffer wrote empty files.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
Put and read commands into an empty edit buffer left an empty line
at the top of the edit buffer.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

For consistency, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit any of these
behaviors.
<P>

Historically, <I>vi</I> did not always return the terminal to its original
modes; for example, ICRNL was modified if it was not
originally set. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this behavior.
<A NAME="lbEO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Command Descriptions in vi</H3>

<P>

Motion commands are among the most complicated aspects of <I>vi</I>
to describe. With some exceptions, the text region and
buffer type effect of a motion command on a <I>vi</I> command are described
on a case-by-case basis. The descriptions of text
regions in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 are not intended to imply direction;
that is, an inclusive region from line <I>n</I> to
line <I>n</I>+5 is identical to a region from line <I>n</I>+5 to line
<I>n</I>. This is of more than academic interest-movements to
marks can be in either direction, and, if the <B>wrapscan</B> option
is set, so can movements to search points. Historically, lines
are always stored into buffers in text order; that is, from the start
of the edit buffer to the end. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires conformance to historical practice.
<P>

Historically, command counts were applied to any associated motion,
and were multiplicative to any supplied motion count. For
example, <B>2cw</B> is the same as <B>c2w</B>, and <B>2c3w</B> is the
same as <B>c6w</B>. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
this behavior. Historically, <I>vi</I> commands that used bigwords,
words, paragraphs, and sentences as objects treated groups of
empty lines, or lines that contained only &lt;blank&gt;s, inconsistently.
Some commands treated them as a single entity, while
others treated each line separately. For example, the <B>w</B>, <B>W</B>,
and <B>B</B> commands treated groups of empty lines as
individual words; that is, the command would move the cursor to each
new empty line. The <B>e</B> and <B>E</B> commands treated
groups of empty lines as a single word; that is, the first use would
move past the group of lines. The <B>b</B> command would just
beep at the user, or if done from the start of the line as a motion
command, fail in unexpected ways. If the lines contained only
(or ended with) &lt;blank&gt;s, the <B>w</B> and <B>W</B> commands would just
beep at the user, the <B>E</B> and <B>e</B> commands
would treat the group as a single word, and the <B>B</B> and <B>b</B>
commands would treat the lines as individual words. For
consistency and simplicity of specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires that all <I>vi</I> commands treat groups of
empty or blank lines as a single entity, and that movement through
lines ending with &lt;blank&gt;s be consistent with other
movements.
<P>

Historically, <I>vi</I> documentation indicated that any number of
double quotes were skipped after punctuation marks at
sentence boundaries; however, implementations only skipped single
quotes. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires both to be
skipped.
<P>

Historically, the first and last characters in the edit buffer were
word boundaries. This historical practice is required by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
<P>

Historically, <I>vi</I> attempted to update the minimum number of columns
on the screen possible, which could lead to misleading
information being displayed. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 makes no requirements
other than that the current character being
entered is displayed correctly, leaving all other decisions in this
area up to the implementation.
<P>

Historically, lines were arbitrarily folded between columns of any
characters that required multiple column positions on the
screen, with the exception of tabs, which terminated at the right-hand
margin. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits the former
and requires the latter. Implementations that do not arbitrarily break
lines between columns of characters that occupy multiple
column positions should not permit the cursor to rest on a column
that does not contain any part of a character.
<P>

The historical <I>vi</I> had a problem in that all movements were by
buffer lines, not by display or screen lines. This is often
the right thing to do; for example, single line movements, such as
<B>j</B> or <B>k</B>, should work on buffer lines. Commands like
<B>dj</B>, or <B>j.</B>, where <B>.</B> is a change command, only make
sense for buffer lines. It is not, however, the right thing
to do for screen motion or scrolling commands like &lt;control&gt;-D, &lt;control&gt;-F,
and <B>H</B>. If the window is fairly
small, using buffer lines in these cases can result in completely
random motion; for example, <B>1</B> &lt;control&gt;-D can result
in a completely changed screen, without any overlap. This is clearly
not what the user wanted. The problem is even worse in the
case of the <B>H</B>, <B>L</B>, and <B>M</B> commands-as they position
the cursor at the first non- &lt;blank&gt; of the line, they
may all refer to the same location in large lines, and will result
in no movement at all.
<P>

In addition, if the line is larger than the screen, using buffer lines
can make it impossible to display parts of the line-there
are not any commands that do not display the beginning of the line
in historical <I>vi</I>, and if both the beginning and end of
the line cannot be on the screen at the same time, the user suffers.
Finally, the page and half-page scrolling commands
historically moved to the first non- &lt;blank&gt; in the new line. If the
line is approximately the same size as the screen, this
is inadequate because the cursor before and after a &lt;control&gt;-D command
will refer to the same location on the screen.
<P>

Implementations of <I>ex</I> and <I>vi</I> exist that do not have these
problems because the
relevant commands ( &lt;control&gt;-B, &lt;control&gt;-D, &lt;control&gt;-F, &lt;control&gt;-U,
&lt;control&gt;-Y,
&lt;control&gt;-E, <B>H</B>, <B>L</B>, and <B>M)</B> operate on display (screen)
lines, not (edit) buffer lines.
<P>

IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this behavior by default because
the standard developers believed that users
would find it too confusing. However, historical practice has been
relaxed. For example, <I>ex</I> and <I>vi</I> historically attempted,
albeit sometimes unsuccessfully, to never put part of a
line on the last lines of a screen; for example, if a line would not
fit in its entirety, no part of the line was displayed, and
the screen lines corresponding to the line contained single <B>'@'</B>
characters. This behavior is permitted, but not required
by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, so that it is possible for implementations
to support long lines in small screens more
reasonably without changing the commands to be oriented to the display
(instead of oriented to the buffer).
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 also permits implementations to refuse to edit
any edit buffer containing a line that will not fit
on the screen in its entirety.
<P>

The display area (for example, the value of the <B>window</B> edit
option) has historically been &quot;grown&quot;, or expanded, to
display new text when local movements are done in displays where the
number of lines displayed is less than the maximum possible.
Expansion has historically been the first choice, when the target
line is less than the maximum possible expansion value away.
Scrolling has historically been the next choice, done when the target
line is less than half a display away, and otherwise, the
screen was redrawn. There were exceptions, however, in that <I>ex</I>
commands generally always
caused the screen to be redrawn. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not specify
a standard behavior because there may be external
issues, such as connection speed, the number of characters necessary
to redraw as opposed to scroll, or terminal capabilities that
implementations will have to accommodate.
<P>

The current line in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 maps one-to-one to a buffer
line in the file. The current column does not.
There are two different column values that are described by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
The first is the current column value
as set by many of the <I>vi</I> commands. This value is remembered
for the lifetime of the editor. The second column value is the
actual position on the screen where the cursor rests. The two are
not always the same. For example, when the cursor is backed by a
multi-column character, the actual cursor position on the screen has
historically been the last column of the character in command
mode, and the first column of the character in input mode.
<P>

Commands that set the current line, but that do not set the current
cursor value (for example, <B>j</B> and <B>k</B>) attempt to
get as close as possible to the remembered column position, so that
the cursor tends to restrict itself to a vertical column as the
user moves around in the edit buffer. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
conformance to historical practice, requiring that
the display location of the cursor on the display line be adjusted
from the current column value as necessary to support this
historical behavior.
<P>

Historically, only a single line (and for some terminals, a single
line minus 1 column) of characters could be entered by the
user for the line-oriented commands; that is, <B>:</B>, <B>!</B>, <B>/</B>,
or <B>?</B>. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits,
but does not require, this limitation.
<P>

Historically, &quot;soft&quot; errors in <I>vi</I> caused the terminal to be
alerted, but no error message was displayed. As a general
rule, no error message was displayed for errors in command execution
in <I>vi</I>, when the error resulted from the user attempting
an invalid or impossible action, or when a searched-for object was
not found. Examples of soft errors included <B>h</B> at the left
margin, &lt;control&gt;-B or <B>[[</B> at the beginning of the file, <B>2G</B>
at the end of the file, and so on. In addition,
errors such as <B>%</B>, <B>]]</B>, <B>}</B>, <B>)</B>, <B>N</B>, <B>n</B>,
<B>f</B>, <B>F</B>, <B>t</B>, and <B>T</B> failing to
find the searched-for object were soft as well. Less consistently,
<B>/</B> and <B>?</B> displayed an error message if the pattern
was not found, <B>/</B>, <B>?</B>, <B>N</B>, and <B>n</B> displayed an
error message if no previous regular expression had been
specified, and <B>;</B> did not display an error message if no previous
<B>f</B>, <B>F</B>, <B>t</B>, or <B>T</B> command had
occurred. Also, behavior in this area might reasonably be based on
a runtime evaluation of the speed of a network connection.
Finally, some implementations have provided error messages for soft
errors in order to assist naive users, based on the value of a
verbose edit option. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not list specific
errors for which an error message shall be displayed.
Implementations should conform to historical practice in the absence
of any strong reason to diverge.
<A NAME="lbEP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Page Backwards</H3>

<P>

The &lt;control&gt;-B and &lt;control&gt;-F commands historically considered it
an error to attempt to page past the beginning
or end of the file, whereas the &lt;control&gt;-D and &lt;control&gt;-U commands
simply moved to the beginning or end of the file.
For consistency, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires the latter behavior
for all four commands. All four commands still
consider it an error if the current line is at the beginning ( &lt;control&gt;-B,
&lt;control&gt;-U) or end ( &lt;control&gt;-F,
&lt;control&gt;-D) of the file. Historically, the &lt;control&gt;-B and &lt;control&gt;-F
commands skip two lines in order to
include overlapping lines when a single command is entered. This makes
less sense in the presence of a <I>count</I>, as there will
be, by definition, no overlapping lines. The actual calculation used
by historical implementations of the <I>vi</I> editor for
&lt;control&gt;-B was:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>((current first line) - count x (window edit option)) +2
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

and for &lt;control&gt;-F was:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>((current first line) + count x (window edit option)) -2
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This calculation does not work well when intermixing commands with
and without counts; for example, <B>3</B> &lt;control&gt;-F
is not equivalent to entering the &lt;control&gt;-F command three times,
and is not reversible by entering the &lt;control&gt;-B
command three times. For consistency with other <I>vi</I> commands
that take counts, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires a
different calculation.
<A NAME="lbEQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Scroll Forward</H3>

<P>

The 4BSD and System V implementations of <I>vi</I> differed on the
initial value used by the <B>scroll</B> command. 4BSD
used:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>((window edit option) +1) /2
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

while System V used the value of the <B>scroll</B> edit option. The
System V version is specified by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 because the standard developers believed that
it was more intuitive and permitted the user a method
of setting the scroll value initially without also setting the number
of lines that are displayed.
<A NAME="lbER">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Scroll Forward by Line</H3>

<P>

Historically, the &lt;control&gt;-E and &lt;control&gt;-Y commands considered
it an error if the last and first lines,
respectively, were already on the screen. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
conformance to historical practice. Historically,
the &lt;control&gt;-E and &lt;control&gt;-Y commands had no effect in open mode.
For simplicity and consistency of specification,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that they behave as usual, albeit
with a single line screen.
<A NAME="lbES">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Clear and Redisplay</H3>

<P>

The historical &lt;control&gt;-L command refreshed the screen exactly as
it was supposed to be currently displayed, replacing
any <B>'@'</B> characters for lines that had been deleted but not updated
on the screen with refreshed <B>'@'</B> characters.
The intent of the &lt;control&gt;-L command is to refresh when the screen
has been accidentally overwritten; for example, by a
<B>write</B> command from another user, or modem noise.
<A NAME="lbET">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Redraw Screen</H3>

<P>

The historical &lt;control&gt;-R command redisplayed only when necessary
to update lines that had been deleted but not updated
on the screen and that were flagged with <B>'@'</B> characters. There
is no requirement that the screen be in any way refreshed
if no lines of this form are currently displayed. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
permits implementations to extend this command to
refresh lines on the screen flagged with <B>'@'</B> characters because
they are too long to be displayed in the current
framework; however, the current line and column need not be modified.
<A NAME="lbEU">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Search for tagstring</H3>

<P>

Historically, the first non- &lt;blank&gt; at or after the cursor was the
first character, and all subsequent characters that
were word characters, up to the end of the line, were included. For
example, with the cursor on the leading space or on the
<B>'#'</B> character in the text <B>&quot;#bar@&quot;</B>, the tag was <B>&quot;#bar&quot;</B>
. On the character <B>'b'</B> it was
<B>&quot;bar&quot;</B>, and on the <B>'a'</B> it was <B>&quot;ar&quot;</B> . IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires this behavior.
<A NAME="lbEV">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Replace Text with Results from Shell Command</H3>

<P>

Historically, the <B>&lt;</B>, <B>&gt;</B>, and <B>!</B> commands considered
most cursor motions other than line-oriented
motions an error; for example, the command <B>&gt;/foo&lt;CR&gt;</B> succeeded,
while the command <B>&gt;l</B> failed, even though
the text region described by the two commands might be identical.
For consistency, all three commands only consider entire lines
and not partial lines, and the region is defined as any line that
contains a character that was specified by the motion.
<A NAME="lbEW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Move to Matching Character</H3>

<P>

Other matching characters have been left implementation-defined in
order to allow extensions such as matching <B>'&lt;'</B>
and <B>'&gt;'</B> for searching HTML, or <B>#ifdef</B>, <B>#else</B>, and
<B>#endif</B> for searching C source.
<A NAME="lbEX">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Repeat Substitution</H3>

<P>

IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that any <B>c</B> and <B>g</B> flags
specified to the previous substitute command be
ignored; however, the <B>r</B> flag may still apply, if supported by
the implementation.
<A NAME="lbEY">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Return to Previous (Context or Section)</H3>

<P>

The <B>[[</B>, <B>]]</B>, <B>(</B>, <B>)</B>, <B>{</B>, and <B>}</B> commands
are all affected by &quot;section boundaries&quot;, but in
some historical implementations not all of the commands recognize
the same section boundaries. This is a bug, not a feature, and a
unique section-boundary algorithm was not described for each command.
One special case that is preserved is that the sentence
command moves to the end of the last line of the edit buffer while
the other commands go to the beginning, in order to preserve the
traditional character cut semantics of the sentence command. Historically,
<I>vi</I> section boundaries at the beginning and end of
the edit buffer were the first non- &lt;blank&gt; on the first and last
lines of the edit buffer if one exists; otherwise, the last
character of the first and last lines of the edit buffer if one exists.
To increase consistency with other section locations, this
has been simplified by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 to the first character
of the first and last lines of the edit buffer, or the
first and the last lines of the edit buffer if they are empty.
<P>

Sentence boundaries were problematic in the historical <I>vi</I>. They
were not only the boundaries as defined for the section
and paragraph commands, but they were the first non- &lt;blank&gt; that
occurred after those boundaries, as well. Historically, the
<I>vi</I> section commands were documented as taking an optional window
size as a <I>count</I> preceding the command. This was not
implemented in historical versions, so IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
that the <I>count</I> repeat the command, for
consistency with other <I>vi</I> commands.
<A NAME="lbEZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Repeat</H3>

<P>

Historically, mapped commands other than text input commands could
not be repeated using the <B>period</B> command.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to historical practice.
<P>

The restrictions on the interpretation of special characters (for
example, &lt;control&gt;-H) in the repetition of text input
mode commands is intended to match historical practice. For example,
given the input sequence:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>iab&lt;control&gt;-H&lt;control&gt;-H&lt;control&gt;-Hdef&lt;escape&gt;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

the user should be informed of an error when the sequence is first
entered, but not during a command repetition. The character
&lt;control&gt;-T is specifically exempted from this restriction. Historical
implementations of <I>vi</I> ignored &lt;control&gt;-T
characters that were input in the original command during command
repetition. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 prohibits this
behavior.
<A NAME="lbFA">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Find Regular Expression</H3>

<P>

Historically, commands did not affect the line searched to or from
if the motion command was a search ( <B>/</B>, <B>?</B>,
<B>N</B>, <B>n</B>) and the final position was the start/end of the
line. There were some special cases and <I>vi</I> was not
consistent. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this behavior,
for consistency. Historical implementations permitted but
were unable to handle searches as motion commands that wrapped (that
is, due to the edit option <B>wrapscan</B>) to the original
location. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that this behavior be treated
as an error.
<P>

Historically, the syntax <B>&quot;/RE/0&quot;</B> was used to force the command
to cut text in line mode. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires conformance to historical practice.
<P>

Historically, in open mode, a <B>z</B> specified to a search command
redisplayed the current line instead of displaying the
current screen with the current line highlighted. For consistency
and simplicity of specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not permit this behavior.
<P>

Historically, trailing <B>z</B> commands were permitted and ignored
if entered as part of a search used as a motion command. For
consistency and simplicity of specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not permit this behavior.
<A NAME="lbFB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Execute an ex Command</H3>

<P>

Historically, <I>vi</I> implementations restricted the commands that
could be entered on the colon command line (for example,
<B>append</B> and <B>change</B>), and some other commands were known
to cause them to fail catastrophically. For consistency,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit these restrictions. When executing
an <I>ex</I>
command by entering <B>:</B>, it is not possible to enter a &lt;newline&gt;
as part of the command because it is considered the end
of the command. A different approach is to enter <I>ex</I> command
mode by using the <I>vi</I>
<B>Q</B> command (and later resuming visual mode with the <I>ex</I>
<B>vi</B> command). In <I>ex</I> command mode, the single-line limitation
does not exist. So, for example, the following
is valid:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>Q
s/break here/break\
here/
vi
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that, if the <I>ex</I> command overwrites
any part of
the screen that would be erased by a refresh, <I>vi</I> pauses for
a character from the user. Historically, this character could be
any character; for example, a character input by the user before the
message appeared, or even a mapped character. This is probably
a bug, but implementations that have tried to be more rigorous by
requiring that the user enter a specific character, or that the
user enter a character after the message was displayed, have been
forced by user indignation back into historical behavior.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to historical practice.
<A NAME="lbFC">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Shift Left (Right)</H3>

<P>

Refer to the Rationale for the <B>!</B> and <B>/</B> commands. Historically,
the <B>&lt;</B> and <B>&gt;</B> commands sometimes
moved the cursor to the first non- &lt;blank&gt; (for example if the command
was repeated or with <B>_</B> as the motion command),
and sometimes left it unchanged. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit
this inconsistency, requiring instead that the
cursor always move to the first non- &lt;blank&gt;. Historically, the <B>&lt;</B>
and <B>&gt;</B> commands did not support buffer
arguments, although some implementations allow the specification of
an optional buffer. This behavior is neither required nor
disallowed by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbFD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Execute</H3>

<P>

Historically, buffers could execute other buffers, and loops, infinite
and otherwise, were possible.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to historical practice.
The * <I>buffer</I> syntax of <I>ex</I> is not required in <I>vi</I>,
because it is not historical practice and has been used in some
<I>vi</I> implementations to support additional scripting languages.
<A NAME="lbFE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Reverse Case</H3>

<P>

Historically, the <B>~</B> command ignored any associated <I>count</I>,
and acted only on the characters in the current
line. For consistency with other <I>vi</I> commands, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires that an associated <I>count</I> act on
the next <I>count</I> characters, and that the command move to subsequent
lines if warranted by <I>count</I>, to make it possible
to modify large pieces of text in a reasonably efficient manner. There
exist <I>vi</I> implementations that optionally require an
associated motion command for the <B>~</B> command. Implementations
supporting this functionality are encouraged to base it on
the <B>tildedop</B> edit option and handle the text regions and cursor
positioning identically to the <B>yank</B> command.
<A NAME="lbFF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Append</H3>

<P>

Historically, <I>count</I>s specified to the <B>A</B>, <B>a</B>, <B>I</B>,
and <B>i</B> commands repeated the input of the first
line <I>count</I> times, and did not repeat the subsequent lines of
the input text. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that
the entire text input be repeated <I>count</I> times.
<A NAME="lbFG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Move Backward to Preceding Word</H3>

<P>

Historically, <I>vi</I> became confused if word commands were used
as motion commands in empty files.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that this be an error. Historical
implementations of <I>vi</I> had a large number of bugs
in the word movement commands, and they varied greatly in behavior
in the presence of empty lines, &quot;words&quot; made up of a single
character, and lines containing only &lt;blank&gt;s. For consistency and
simplicity of specification,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this behavior.
<A NAME="lbFH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Change to End-of-Line</H3>

<P>

Some historical implementations of the <B>C</B> command did not behave
as described by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 when the
<B>$</B> key was remapped because they were implemented by pushing
the <B>$</B> key onto the input queue and reprocessing it.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this behavior. Historically,
the <B>C</B>, <B>S</B>, and <B>s</B> commands did not
copy replaced text into the numeric buffers. For consistency and simplicity
of specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires that they behave like their respective <B>c</B> commands in
all respects.
<A NAME="lbFI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Delete</H3>

<P>

Historically, lines in open mode that were deleted were scrolled up,
and an <B>@</B> glyph written over the beginning of the
line. In the case of terminals that are incapable of the necessary
cursor motions, the editor erased the deleted line from the
screen. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to historical
practice; that is, if the terminal cannot display the
<B>'@'</B> character, the line cannot remain on the screen.
<A NAME="lbFJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Delete to End-of-Line</H3>

<P>

Some historical implementations of the <B>D</B> command did not behave
as described by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 when the
<B>$</B> key was remapped because they were implemented by pushing
the <B>$</B> key onto the input queue and reprocessing it.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this behavior.
<A NAME="lbFK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Join</H3>

<P>

An historical oddity of <I>vi</I> is that the commands <B>J</B>, <B>1J</B>,
and <B>2J</B> are all equivalent.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to historical practice.
The <I>vi</I> <B>J</B> command is specified in terms of
the <I>ex</I> <B>join</B> command with an <I>ex</I> command
<I>count</I> value. The address correction for a <I>count</I> that is
past the end of the edit buffer is necessary for historical
compatibility for both <I>ex</I> and <I>vi</I>.
<A NAME="lbFL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Mark Position</H3>

<P>

Historical practice is that only lowercase letters, plus <B>'`'</B>
and <B>'&quot;</B>, could be used to mark a cursor
position. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to historical
practice, but encourages implementations to support
other characters as marks as well.
<A NAME="lbFM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Repeat Regular Expression Find (Forward and Reverse)</H3>

<P>

Historically, the <B>N</B> and <B>n</B> commands could not be used as
motion components for the <B>c</B> command. With the
exception of the <B>cN</B> command, which worked if the search crossed
a line boundary, the text region would be discarded, and the
user would not be in text input mode. For consistency and simplicity
of specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not
permit this behavior.
<A NAME="lbFN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Insert Empty Line (Below and Above)</H3>

<P>

Historically, counts to the <B>O</B> and <B>o</B> commands were used
as the number of physical lines to open, if the terminal
was dumb and the <B>slowopen</B> option was not set. This was intended
to minimize traffic over slow connections and repainting for
dumb terminals. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this behavior,
requiring that a <I>count</I> to the open command
behave as for other text input commands. This change to historical
practice was made for consistency, and because a superset of the
functionality is provided by the <B>slowopen</B> edit option.
<A NAME="lbFO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Put from Buffer (Following and Before)</H3>

<P>

Historically, <I>count</I>s to the <B>p</B> and <B>P</B> commands were
ignored if the buffer was a line mode buffer, but were
(mostly) implemented as described in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 if the
buffer was a character mode buffer. Because
implementations exist that do not have this limitation, and because
pasting lines multiple times is generally useful,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that <I>count</I> be supported for
all <B>p</B> and <B>P</B> commands.
<P>

Historical implementations of <I>vi</I> were widely known to have major
problems in the <B>p</B> and <B>P</B> commands,
particularly when unusual regions of text were copied into the edit
buffer. The standard developers viewed these as bugs, and they
are not permitted for consistency and simplicity of specification.
<P>

Historically, a <B>P</B> or <B>p</B> command (or an <I>ex</I> <B>put</B>
command executed
from open or visual mode) executed in an empty file, left an empty
line as the first line of the file. For consistency and
simplicity of specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit
this behavior.
<A NAME="lbFP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Replace Character</H3>

<P>

Historically, the <B>r</B> command did not correctly handle the <I>erase</I>
and <I>word erase</I> characters as arguments, nor
did it handle an associated <I>count</I> greater than 1 with a &lt;carriage-return&gt;
argument, for which it replaced <I>count</I>
characters with a single &lt;newline&gt;. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not
permit these inconsistencies.
<P>

Historically, the <B>r</B> command permitted the &lt;control&gt;-V escaping
of entered characters, such as &lt;ESC&gt; and the
&lt;carriage-return&gt;; however, it required two leading &lt;control&gt;-V characters
instead of one.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that this be changed for consistency
with the other text input commands of <I>vi</I>.
<P>

Historically, it is an error to enter the <B>r</B> command if there
are less than <I>count</I> characters at or after the cursor
in the line. While a reasonable and unambiguous extension would be
to permit the <B>r</B> command on empty lines, it would require
that too large a <I>count</I> be adjusted to match the number of characters
at or after the cursor for consistency, which is
sufficiently different from historical practice to be avoided. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires conformance to historical
practice.
<A NAME="lbFQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Replace Characters</H3>

<P>

Historically, if there were <B>autoindent</B> characters in the line
on which the <B>R</B> command was run, and
<B>autoindent</B> was set, the first &lt;newline&gt; would be properly indented
and no characters would be replaced by the
&lt;newline&gt;. Each additional &lt;newline&gt; would replace <I>n</I> characters,
where <I>n</I> was the number of characters
that were needed to indent the rest of the line to the proper indentation
level. This behavior is a bug and is not permitted by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbFR">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Undo</H3>

<P>

Historical practice for cursor positioning after undoing commands
was mixed. In most cases, when undoing commands that affected
a single line, the cursor was moved to the start of added or changed
text, or immediately after deleted text. However, if the user
had moved from the line being changed, the column was either set to
the first non- &lt;blank&gt;, returned to the origin of the
command, or remained unchanged. When undoing commands that affected
multiple lines or entire lines, the cursor was moved to the
first character in the first line restored. As an example of how inconsistent
this was, a search, followed by an <B>o</B> text
input command, followed by an <B>undo</B> would return the cursor to
the location where the <B>o</B> command was entered, but a
<B>cw</B> command followed by an <B>o</B> command followed by an <B>undo</B>
would return the cursor to the first non-
&lt;blank&gt; of the line. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires the most useful
of these behaviors, and discards the least
useful, in the interest of consistency and simplicity of specification.
<A NAME="lbFS">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Yank</H3>

<P>

Historically, the <B>yank</B> command did not move to the end of the
motion if the motion was in the forward direction. It moved
to the end of the motion if the motion was in the backward direction,
except for the <B>_</B> command, or for the <B>G</B> and
<B>'</B> commands when the end of the motion was on the current line.
This was further complicated by the fact that for a number of
motion commands, the <B>yank</B> command moved the cursor but did not
update the screen; for example, a subsequent command would
move the cursor from the end of the motion, even though the cursor
on the screen had not reflected the cursor movement for the
<B>yank</B> command. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that all <B>yank</B>
commands associated with backward motions move
the cursor to the end of the motion for consistency, and specifically,
to make <B>'</B> commands as motions consistent with search
patterns as motions.
<A NAME="lbFT">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Yank Current Line</H3>

<P>

Some historical implementations of the <B>Y</B> command did not behave
as described by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 when the
<B>'_'</B> key was remapped because they were implemented by pushing
the <B>'_'</B> key onto the input queue and reprocessing
it. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this behavior.
<A NAME="lbFU">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Redraw Window</H3>

<P>

Historically, the <B>z</B> command always redrew the screen. This is
permitted but not required by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, because of the frequent use of the <B>z</B>
command in macros such as <B>map n nz.</B> for screen
positioning, instead of its use to change the screen size. The standard
developers believed that expanding or scrolling the screen
offered a better interface for users. The ability to redraw the screen
is preserved if the optional new window size is specified,
and in the &lt;control&gt;-L and &lt;control&gt;-R commands.
<P>

The semantics of <B>z^</B> are confusing at best. Historical practice
is that the screen before the screen that ended with the
specified line is displayed. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance
to historical practice.
<P>

Historically, the <B>z</B> command would not display a partial line
at the top or bottom of the screen. If the partial line
would normally have been displayed at the bottom of the screen, the
command worked, but the partial line was replaced with
<B>'@'</B> characters. If the partial line would normally have been
displayed at the top of the screen, the command would fail.
For consistency and simplicity of specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not permit this behavior.
<P>

Historically, the <B>z</B> command with a line specification of 1 ignored
the command. For consistency and simplicity of
specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this behavior.
<P>

Historically, the <B>z</B> command did not set the cursor column to
the first non- &lt;blank&gt; for the character if the first
screen was to be displayed, and was already displayed. For consistency
and simplicity of specification,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this behavior.
<A NAME="lbFV">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Input Mode Commands in vi</H3>

<P>

Historical implementations of <I>vi</I> did not permit the user to
erase more than a single line of input, or to use normal
erase characters such as <I>line erase</I>, <I>worderase</I>, and <I>erase</I>
to erase <B>autoindent</B> characters. As there
exist implementations of <I>vi</I> that do not have these limitations,
both behaviors are permitted, but only historical practice
is required. In the case of these extensions, <I>vi</I> is required
to pause at the <B>autoindent</B> and previous line
boundaries.
<P>

Historical implementations of <I>vi</I> updated only the portion of
the screen where the current cursor character was displayed.
For example, consider the <I>vi</I> input keystrokes:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>iabcd&lt;escape&gt;0C&lt;tab&gt;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Historically, the &lt;tab&gt; would overwrite the characters <B>&quot;abcd&quot;</B>
when it was displayed. Other implementations
replace only the <B>'a'</B> character with the &lt;tab&gt;, and then push
the rest of the characters ahead of the cursor. Both
implementations have problems. The historical implementation is probably
visually nicer for the above example; however, for the
keystrokes:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>iabcd&lt;ESC&gt;0R&lt;tab&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

the historical implementation results in the string <B>&quot;bcd&quot;</B> disappearing
and then magically reappearing when the
&lt;ESC&gt; character is entered. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires the former
behavior when overwriting erase-columns-that
is, overwriting characters that are no longer logically part of the
edit buffer-and the latter behavior otherwise.
<P>

Historical implementations of <I>vi</I> discarded the &lt;control&gt;-D and
&lt;control&gt;-T characters when they were entered
at places where their command functionality was not appropriate. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires that the &lt;control&gt;-T
functionality always be available, and that &lt;control&gt;-D be treated
as any other key when not operating on <B>autoindent</B>
characters.
<A NAME="lbFW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>NUL</H3>

<P>

Some historical implementations of <I>vi</I> limited the number of
characters entered using the NUL input character to 256
bytes. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits this limitation; however, implementations
are encouraged to remove this limit.
<A NAME="lbFX">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>&lt;control&gt;-D</H3>

<P>

See also Rationale for the input mode command &lt;newline&gt;. The hidden
assumptions in the &lt;control&gt;-D command (and in
the <I>vi</I> <B>autoindent</B> specification in general) is that &lt;space&gt;s
take up a single column on the screen and that
&lt;tab&gt;s are comprised of an integral number of &lt;space&gt;s.
<A NAME="lbFY">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>&lt;newline&gt;</H3>

<P>

Implementations are permitted to rewrite <B>autoindent</B> characters
in the line when &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;carriage-return&gt;,
&lt;control&gt;-D, and &lt;control&gt;-T are entered, or when the <B>shift</B>
commands are used, because historical
implementations have both done so and found it necessary to do so.
For example, a &lt;control&gt;-D when the cursor is preceded by
a single &lt;tab&gt;, with <B>tabstop</B> set to 8, and <B>shiftwidth</B>
set to 3, will result in the &lt;tab&gt; being replaced
by several &lt;space&gt;s.
<A NAME="lbFZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>&lt;control&gt;-T</H3>

<P>

See also the Rationale for the input mode command &lt;newline&gt;. Historically,
&lt;control&gt;-T only worked if no non-
&lt;blank&gt;s had yet been input in the current input line. In addition,
the characters inserted by &lt;control&gt;-T were treated
as <B>autoindent</B> characters, and could not be erased using normal
user erase characters. Because implementations exist that do
not have these limitations, and as moving to a column boundary is
generally useful, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that
both limitations be removed.
<A NAME="lbGA">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>&lt;control&gt;-V</H3>

<P>

Historically, <I>vi</I> used <B>^V</B>, regardless of the value of the
literal-next character of the terminal.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to historical practice.
<P>

The uses described for &lt;control&gt;-V can also be accomplished with &lt;control&gt;-Q,
which is useful on terminals that use
&lt;control&gt;-V for the down-arrow function. However, most historical
implementations use &lt;control&gt;-Q for the
<I>termios</I> START character, so the editor will generally not receive
the &lt;control&gt;-Q unless <B>stty ixon</B> mode is set
to off. (In addition, some historical implementations of <I>vi</I>
explicitly set <B>ixon</B> mode to on, so it was difficult for
the user to set it to off.) Any of the command characters described
in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 can be made ineffective by
their selection as <I>termios</I> control characters, using the <I>stty</I>
utility or other
methods described in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbGB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>&lt;ESC&gt;</H3>

<P>

Historically, SIGINT alerted the terminal when used to end input mode.
This behavior is permitted, but not required, by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbGC">&nbsp;</A>
