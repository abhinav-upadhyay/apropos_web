<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The first synopsis form is denoted by two operands, neither of which are existing files of type directory. The  <i>cp</i> utility shall copy the contents of  <i>source_file</i> (or, if <i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link, the contents of the file referenced by  <i>source_file</i>) to the destination path named by  <i>target_file.</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The second synopsis form is denoted by two or more operands where the  <b>-R</b> or <b>-r</b> options are not specified and the first synopsis form is not applicable. It shall be an error if any  <i>source_file</i> is a file of type directory, if <i>target</i> does not exist, or if  <i>target</i> is a file of a type defined by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, but is not a file of type directory. The  <i>cp</i> utility shall copy the contents of each  <i>source_file</i> (or, if  <i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link, the contents of the file referenced by  <i>source_file</i>) to the destination path named by the concatenation of  <i>target</i>, a slash character, and the last component of  <i>source_file</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The third and fourth synopsis forms are denoted by two or more operands where the  <b>-R</b> or <b>-r</b> options are specified. The  <i>cp</i> utility shall copy each file in the file hierarchy rooted in each  <i>source_file</i> to a destination path named as follows:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
If <i>target</i> exists and is a file of type directory, the name of the corresponding destination path for each file in the file hierarchy shall be the concatenation of  <i>target</i>, a slash character, and the pathname of the file relative to the directory containing  <i>source_file</i>.</dd>

If <i>target</i> does not exist and two operands are specified, the name of the corresponding destination path for  <i>source_file</i> shall be <i>target</i>; the name of the corresponding destination path for all other files in the file hierarchy shall be the concatenation of  <i>target</i>, a slash character, and the pathname of the file relative to  <i>source_file</i>.</dd>

<h1>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h1> If  <i>cp</i> is prematurely terminated by a signal or error, files or file hierarchies may be only partially copied and files and directories may have incorrect permissions or access and modification times.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> The difference between  <b>-R</b> and <b>-r</b> is in the treatment by  <i>cp</i> of file types other than regular and directory. The original  <b>-r</b> flag, for historic reasons, does not handle special files any differently from regular files, but always reads the file and copies its contents. This has obvious problems in the presence of special file types; for example, character devices, FIFOs, and sockets. The  <b>-R</b> option is intended to recreate the file hierarchy and the  <b>-r</b> option supports historical practice. It was anticipated that a future version of this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 would deprecate the  <b>-r</b> option, and for that reason, there has been no attempt to fix its behavior with respect to FIFOs or other file types where copying the file is clearly wrong. However, some implementations support  <b>-r</b> with the same abilities as the <b>-R</b> defined in this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001. To accommodate them as well as systems that do not, the differences between  <b>-r</b> and <b>-R</b> are implementation-defined. Implementations may make them identical. The  <b>-r</b> option is marked obsolescent.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are explicitly cleared when files are created. This is to prevent users from creating programs that are set-user-ID or set-group-ID to them when copying files or to make set-user-ID or set-group-ID files accessible to new groups of users. For example, if a file is set-user-ID and the copy has a different group ID than the source, a new group of users has execute permission to a set-user-ID program than did previously. In particular, this is a problem for superusers copying users' trees.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> The  <b>-i</b> option exists on BSD systems, giving applications and users a way to avoid accidentally removing files when copying. Although the 4.3 BSD version does not prompt if the standard input is not a terminal, the standard developers decided that use of  <b>-i</b> is a request for interaction, so when the destination path exists, the utility takes instructions from whatever responds on standard input.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general nature of the contents of prompts are specified because implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than those used on historical implementations. Therefore, an application using the  <b>-i</b> option relies on the system to provide the most suitable dialog directly with the user, based on the behavior specified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-p</b> option is historical practice on BSD systems, duplicating the time of last data modification and time of last access. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 extends it to preserve the user and group IDs, as well as the file permissions. This requirement has obvious problems in that the directories are almost certainly modified after being copied. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 requires that the modification times be preserved. The statement that the order in which the characteristics are duplicated is unspecified is to permit implementations to provide the maximum amount of security for the user. Implementations should take into account the obvious security issues involved in setting the owner, group, and mode in the wrong order or creating files with an owner, group, or mode different from the final value.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is unspecified whether <i>cp</i> writes diagnostic messages when the user and group IDs cannot be set due to the widespread practice of users using  <b>-p</b> to duplicate some portion of the file characteristics, indifferent to the duplication of others. Historic implementations only write diagnostic messages on errors other than [EPERM].<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-r</b> option is historical practice on BSD and BSD-derived systems, copying file hierarchies as opposed to single files. This functionality is used heavily in historical applications, and its loss would significantly decrease consensus. The  <b>-R</b> option was added as a close synonym to the  <b>-r</b> option, selected for consistency with all other options in this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 that do recursive directory descent.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a failure occurs during the copying of a file hierarchy, <i>cp</i> is required to attempt to copy files that are on the same level in the hierarchy or above the file where the failure occurred. It is unspecified if  <i>cp</i> shall attempt to copy files below the file where the failure occurred (which cannot succeed in any case).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Permissions, owners, and groups of created special file types have been deliberately left as implementation-defined. This is to allow systems to satisfy special requirements (for example, allowing users to create character special devices, but requiring them to be owned by a certain group). In general, it is strongly suggested that the permissions, owner, and group be the same as if the user had run the historical  <i>mknod</i>, <i>ln</i>, or other utility to create the file. It is also probable that additional privileges are required to create block, character, or other implementation-defined special file types.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Additionally, the <b>-p</b> option explicitly requires that all set-user-ID and set-group-ID permissions be discarded if any of the owner or group IDs cannot be set. This is to keep users from unintentionally giving away special privilege when copying programs.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When creating regular files, historical versions of <i>cp</i> use the mode of the source file as modified by the file mode creation mask. Other choices would have been to use the mode of the source file unmodified by the creation mask or to use the same mode as would be given to a new file created by the user (plus the execution bits of the source file) and then modify it by the file mode creation mask. In the absence of any strong reason to change historic practice, it was in large part retained.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When creating directories, historical versions of <i>cp</i> use the mode of the source directory, plus read, write, and search bits for the owner, as modified by the file mode creation mask. This is done so that  <i>cp</i> can copy trees where the user has read permission, but the owner does not. A side effect is that if the file creation mask denies the owner permissions,  <i>cp</i> fails. Also, once the copy is done, historical versions of  <i>cp</i> set the permissions on the created directory to be the same as the source directory, unmodified by the file creation mask.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This behavior has been modified so that <i>cp</i> is always able to create the contents of the directory, regardless of the file creation mask. After the copy is done, the permissions are set to be the same as the source directory, as modified by the file creation mask. This latter change from historical behavior is to prevent users from accidentally creating directories with permissions beyond those they would normally set and for consistency with the behavior of  <i>cp</i> in creating files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is not a requirement that <i>cp</i> detect attempts to copy a file to itself; however, implementations are strongly encouraged to do so. Historical implementations have detected the attempt in most cases.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are two methods of copying subtrees in this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001. The other method is described as part of the  <i>pax</i> utility (see <i>pax</i> ). Both methods are historical practice. The  <i>cp</i> utility provides a simpler, more intuitive interface, while  <i>pax</i> offers a finer granularity of control. Each provides additional functionality to the other; in particular,  <i>pax</i> maintains the hard-link structure of the hierarchy, while  <i>cp</i> does not. It is the intention of the standard developers that the results be similar (using appropriate option combinations in both utilities). The results are not required to be identical; there seemed insufficient gain to applications to balance the difficulty of implementations having to guarantee that the results would be exactly identical.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The wording allowing <i>cp</i> to copy a directory to implementation-defined file types not specified by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 is provided so that implementations supporting symbolic links are not required to prohibit copying directories to symbolic links. Other extensions to the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 file types may need to use this loophole as well.</div>
