<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

yacc - yet another compiler compiler (<B>DEVELOPMENT</B>)
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>yacc</B> <B>[</B><B>-dltv</B><B>][</B><B>-b</B> <I>file_prefix</I><B>][</B><B>-p</B>
<I>sym_prefix</I><B>]</B> <I>grammar</I><B></B>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>yacc</I> utility shall read a description of a context-free
grammar in <I>grammar</I> and write C source code, conforming
to the ISO&nbsp;C standard, to a code file, and optionally header information
into a header file, in the current directory. The C
code shall define a function and related routines and macros for an
automaton that executes a parsing algorithm meeting the
requirements in Algorithms .
<P>

The form and meaning of the grammar are described in the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section.
<P>

The C source code and header file shall be produced in a form suitable
as input for the C compiler (see <I>c99</I> ).
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The <I>yacc</I> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
<P>

The following options shall be supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-b&nbsp;</B> <I>file_prefix</I><DD>
Use <I>file_prefix</I> instead of <B>y</B> as the prefix for all output
filenames. The code file <B>y.tab.c</B>, the header
file <B>y.tab.h</B> (created when <B>-d</B> is specified), and the description
file <B>y.output</B> (created when <B>-v</B> is
specified), shall be changed to <I>file_prefix</I> <B>.tab.c</B>, <I>file_prefix</I>
<B>.tab.h</B>, and <I>file_prefix</I>
<B>.output</B>, respectively.
<DT><B>-d</B><DD>
Write the header file; by default only the code file is written. The
<B>#define</B> statements associate the token codes
assigned by <I>yacc</I> with the user-declared token names. This allows
source files other than <B>y.tab.c</B> to access the token
codes.
<DT><B>-l</B><DD>
Produce a code file that does not contain any <B>#line</B> constructs.
If this option is not present, it is unspecified whether
the code file or header file contains <B>#line</B> directives. This
should only be used after the grammar and the associated
actions are fully debugged.
<DT><B>-p&nbsp;</B> <I>sym_prefix</I><DD>
<P>
Use <I>sym_prefix</I> instead of <B>yy</B> as the prefix for all external
names produced by <I>yacc</I>. The names affected shall
include the functions <I>yyparse</I>(), <I>yylex</I>(), and <I>yyerror</I>(),
and the variables <I>yylval</I>, <I>yychar</I>, and
<I>yydebug</I>. (In the remainder of this section, the six symbols
cited are referenced using their default names only as a
notational convenience.) Local names may also be affected by the <B>-p</B>
option; however, the <B>-p</B> option shall not affect
<B>#define</B> symbols generated by <I>yacc</I>.
<DT><B>-t</B><DD>
Modify conditional compilation directives to permit compilation of
debugging code in the code file. Runtime debugging
statements shall always be contained in the code file, but by default
conditional compilation directives prevent their
compilation.
<DT><B>-v</B><DD>
Write a file containing a description of the parser and a report of
conflicts generated by ambiguities in the grammar.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPERANDS</H2>

<P>

The following operand is required:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>grammar</I><DD>
A pathname of a file containing instructions, hereafter called <I>grammar</I>,
for which a parser is to be created. The format
for the grammar is described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDIN</H2>

<P>

Not used.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

The file <I>grammar</I> shall be a text file formatted as specified
in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<P>

The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
<I>yacc</I>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>LANG</I><DD>
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
<DT><I>LC_ALL</I><DD>
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
<DT><I>LC_CTYPE</I><DD>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
<DT><I>LC_MESSAGES</I><DD>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
<DT><I>NLSPATH</I><DD>
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <I>LC_MESSAGES
.</I> 
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The <I>LANG</I> and <I>LC_*</I> variables affect the execution of the
<I>yacc</I> utility as stated. The <I>main</I>() function
defined in Yacc Library shall call:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;&quot;)
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

and thus the program generated by <I>yacc</I> shall also be affected
by the contents of these variables at runtime.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</H2>

<P>

Default.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDOUT</H2>

<P>

Not used.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STDERR</H2>

<P>

If shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts are detected in <I>grammar</I>,
<I>yacc</I> shall write a report of those conflicts
to the standard error in an unspecified format.
<P>

Standard error shall also be used for diagnostic messages.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OUTPUT FILES</H2>

<P>

The code file, the header file, and the description file shall be
text files. All are described in the following sections.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Code File</H3>

<P>

This file shall contain the C source code for the <I>yyparse</I>()
function. It shall contain code for the various semantic
actions with macro substitution performed on them as described in
the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section. It also shall contain a copy of
the <B>#define</B> statements in the header file. If a <B>%union</B>
declaration is used, the declaration for YYSTYPE shall also be
included in this file.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Header File</H3>

<P>

The header file shall contain <B>#define</B> statements that associate
the token numbers with the token names. This allows
source files other than the code file to access the token codes. If
a <B>%union</B> declaration is used, the declaration for
YYSTYPE and an <I>extern YYSTYPE yylval</I> declaration shall also
be included in this file.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Description File</H3>

<P>

The description file shall be a text file containing a description
of the state machine corresponding to the parser, using an
unspecified format. Limits for internal tables (see Limits ) shall
also be reported, in an
implementation-defined manner. (Some implementations may use dynamic
allocation techniques and have no specific limit values to
report.)
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>yacc</I> command accepts a language that is used to define a
grammar for a target language to be parsed by the tables and
code generated by <I>yacc</I>. The language accepted by <I>yacc</I>
as a grammar for the target language is described below using
the <I>yacc</I> input language itself.
<P>

The input <I>grammar</I> includes rules describing the input structure
of the target language and code to be invoked when these
rules are recognized to provide the associated semantic action. The
code to be executed shall appear as bodies of text that are
intended to be C-language code. The C-language inclusions are presumed
to form a correct function when processed by <I>yacc</I>
into its output files. The code included in this way shall be executed
during the recognition of the target language.
<P>

Given a grammar, the <I>yacc</I> utility generates the files described
in the OUTPUT FILES section. The code file can be
compiled and linked using <I>c99</I>. If the declaration and programs
sections of the grammar
file did not include definitions of <I>main</I>(), <I>yylex</I>(), and
<I>yyerror</I>(), the compiled output requires linking with
externally supplied versions of those functions. Default versions
of <I>main</I>() and <I>yyerror</I>() are supplied in the
<I>yacc</I> library and can be linked in by using the <B>-l&nbsp;y</B> operand
to <I>c99</I>.
The <I>yacc</I> library interfaces need not support interfaces with
other than the default <B>yy</B> symbol prefix. The application
provides the lexical analyzer function, <I>yylex</I>(); the <I>lex</I>
utility is specifically
designed to generate such a routine.
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Input Language</H3>

<P>

The application shall ensure that every specification file consists
of three sections in order: <I>declarations</I>, <I>grammar
rules</I>, and <I>programs</I>, separated by double percent signs (
<B>&quot;%%&quot;</B> ). The declarations and programs sections can be
empty. If the latter is empty, the preceding <B>&quot;%%&quot;</B> mark separating
it from the rules section can be omitted.
<P>

The input is free form text following the structure of the grammar
defined below.
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Lexical Structure of the Grammar</H3>

<P>

The &lt;blank&gt;s, &lt;newline&gt;s, and &lt;form-feed&gt;s shall be ignored, except
that the application shall ensure that
they do not appear in names or multi-character reserved symbols. Comments
shall be enclosed in <B>&quot;/*&nbsp;...&nbsp;*/&quot;</B>, and
can appear wherever a name is valid.
<P>

Names are of arbitrary length, made up of letters, periods ( <B>'.'</B>
), underscores ( <B>'_'</B> ), and non-initial
digits. Uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct. Conforming applications
shall not use names beginning in <B>yy</B> or
<B>YY</B> since the <I>yacc</I> parser uses such names. Many of the
names appear in the final output of <I>yacc</I>, and thus they
should be chosen to conform with any additional rules created by the
C compiler to be used. In particular they appear in
<B>#define</B> statements.
<P>

A literal shall consist of a single character enclosed in single-quotes
( <B>'&quot;</B> ). All of the escape sequences supported
for character constants by the ISO&nbsp;C standard shall be supported
by <I>yacc</I>.
<P>

The relationship with the lexical analyzer is discussed in detail
below.
<P>

The application shall ensure that the NUL character is not used in
grammar rules or literals.
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Declarations Section</H3>

<P>

The declarations section is used to define the symbols used to define
the target language and their relationship with each
other. In particular, much of the additional information required
to resolve ambiguities in the context-free grammar for the target
language is provided here.
<P>

Usually <I>yacc</I> assigns the relationship between the symbolic names
it generates and their underlying numeric value. The
declarations section makes it possible to control the assignment of
these values.
<P>

It is also possible to keep semantic information associated with the
tokens currently on the parse stack in a user-defined
C-language <B>union</B>, if the members of the union are associated
with the various names in the grammar. The declarations section
provides for this as well.
<P>

The first group of declarators below all take a list of names as arguments.
That list can optionally be preceded by the name of
a C union member (called a <I>tag</I> below) appearing within <B>'&lt;'</B>
and <B>'&gt;'</B> . (As an exception to the
typographical conventions of the rest of this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001,
in this case &lt;<I>tag</I>&gt; does not
represent a metavariable, but the literal angle bracket characters
surrounding a symbol.) The use of <I>tag</I> specifies that the
tokens named on this line shall be of the same C type as the union
member referenced by <I>tag</I>. This is discussed in more
detail below.
<P>

For lists used to define tokens, the first appearance of a given token
can be followed by a positive integer (as a string of
decimal digits). If this is done, the underlying value assigned to
it for lexical purposes shall be taken to be that number.
<P>

The following declares <I>name</I> to be a token:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>%token</B> <B>[</B><B>&lt;</B><I>tag</I><B>&gt;</B><B>]</B> <I>name</I> <B>[</B><I>number</I><B>][</B><I>name</I> <B>[</B><I>number</I><B>]]</B><B>...
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

If <I>tag</I> is present, the C type for all tokens on this line shall
be declared to be the type referenced by <I>tag</I>. If a
positive integer, <I>number</I>, follows a <I>name</I>, that value shall
be assigned to the token.
<P>

The following declares <I>name</I> to be a token, and assigns precedence
to it:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>%left</B> <B>[</B><B>&lt;</B><I>tag</I><B>&gt;</B><B>]</B> <I>name</I> <B>[</B><I>number</I><B>][</B><I>name</I> <B>[</B><I>number</I><B>]]</B><B>...
%right</B> <B>[</B><B>&lt;</B><I>tag</I><B>&gt;</B><B>]</B> <I>name</I> <B>[</B><I>number</I><B>][</B><I>name</I> <B>[</B><I>number</I><B>]]</B><B>...
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

One or more lines, each beginning with one of these symbols, can appear
in this section. All tokens on the same line have the
same precedence level and associativity; the lines are in order of
increasing precedence or binding strength. <B>%left</B> denotes
that the operators on that line are left associative, and <B>%right</B>
similarly denotes right associative operators. If
<I>tag</I> is present, it shall declare a C type for <I>name</I>s as
described for <B>%token</B>.
<P>

The following declares <I>name</I> to be a token, and indicates that
this cannot be used associatively:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>%nonassoc</B> <B>[</B><B>&lt;</B><I>tag</I><B>&gt;</B><B>]</B> <I>name</I> <B>[</B><I>number</I><B>][</B><I>name</I> <B>[</B><I>number</I><B>]]</B><B>...
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

If the parser encounters associative use of this token it reports
an error. If <I>tag</I> is present, it shall declare a C type
for <I>name</I>s as described for <B>%token</B>.
<P>

The following declares that union member <I>name</I>s are non-terminals,
and thus it is required to have a <I>tag</I> field at
its beginning:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>%type &lt;</B><I>tag</I><B>&gt;</B> <I>name</I><B>...
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Because it deals with non-terminals only, assigning a token number
or using a literal is also prohibited. If this construct is
present, <I>yacc</I> shall perform type checking; if this construct
is not present, the parse stack shall hold only the <B>int</B>
type.
<P>

Every name used in <I>grammar</I> not defined by a <B>%token</B>, <B>%left</B>,
<B>%right</B>, or <B>%nonassoc</B> declaration
is assumed to represent a non-terminal symbol. The <I>yacc</I> utility
shall report an error for any non-terminal symbol that does
not appear on the left side of at least one grammar rule.
<P>

Once the type, precedence, or token number of a name is specified,
it shall not be changed. If the first declaration of a token
does not assign a token number, <I>yacc</I> shall assign a token number.
Once this assignment is made, the token number shall not
be changed by explicit assignment.
<P>

The following declarators do not follow the previous pattern.
<P>

The following declares the non-terminal <I>name</I> to be the <I>start
symbol</I>, which represents the largest, most general
structure described by the grammar rules:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>%start</B> <I>name</I>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

By default, it is the left-hand side of the first grammar rule; this
default can be overridden with this declaration.
<P>

The following declares the <I>yacc</I> value stack to be a union of
the various types of values desired:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>%union {</B> <I>body of union</I> <B>(</B><I>in C</I><B>) }
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

By default, the values returned by actions (see below) and the lexical
analyzer shall be of type <B>int</B>. The <I>yacc</I>
utility keeps track of types, and it shall insert corresponding union
member names in order to perform strict type checking of the
resulting parser.
<P>

Alternatively, given that at least one &lt;<I>tag</I>&gt; construct is used,
the union can be declared in a header file (which
shall be included in the declarations section by using a <B>#include</B>
construct within <B>%{</B> and <B>%}</B>), and a
<B>typedef</B> used to define the symbol YYSTYPE to represent this
union. The effect of <B>%union</B> is to provide the declaration
of YYSTYPE directly from the <I>yacc</I> input.
<P>

C-language declarations and definitions can appear in the declarations
section, enclosed by the following marks:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>%{ ... %}
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

These statements shall be copied into the code file, and have global
scope within it so that they can be used in the rules and
program sections.
<P>

The application shall ensure that the declarations section is terminated
by the token <B>%%</B>.
<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Grammar Rules in yacc</H3>

<P>

The rules section defines the context-free grammar to be accepted
by the function <I>yacc</I> generates, and associates with
those rules C-language actions and additional precedence information.
The grammar is described below, and a formal definition
follows.
<P>

The rules section is comprised of one or more grammar rules. A grammar
rule has the form:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

<B>A : BODY ;
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The symbol <B>A</B> represents a non-terminal name, and <B>BODY</B>
represents a sequence of zero or more <I>name</I>s,
<I>literal</I>s, and <I>semantic action</I>s that can then be followed
by optional <I>precedence rule</I>s. Only the names and
literals participate in the formation of the grammar; the semantic
actions and precedence rules are used in other ways. The colon
and the semicolon are <I>yacc</I> punctuation. If there are several
successive grammar rules with the same left-hand side, the
vertical bar <B>'|'</B> can be used to avoid rewriting the left-hand
side; in this case the semicolon appears only after the last
rule. The BODY part can be empty (or empty of names and literals)
to indicate that the non-terminal symbol matches the empty
string.
<P>

The <I>yacc</I> utility assigns a unique number to each rule. Rules
using the vertical bar notation are distinct rules. The
number assigned to the rule appears in the description file.
<P>

The elements comprising a BODY are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>name</I>,&nbsp;<I>literal</I><DD>
These form the rules of the grammar: <I>name</I> is either a <I>token</I>
or a <I>non-terminal</I>; <I>literal</I> stands for
itself (less the lexically required quotation marks).
<DT><I>semantic action</I><DD>
<P>
With each grammar rule, the user can associate actions to be performed
each time the rule is recognized in the input process. (Note
that the word &quot;action&quot; can also refer to the actions of the parser-shift,
reduce, and so on.) 
</DL>
<P>

These actions can return values and can obtain the values returned
by previous actions. These values are kept in objects of type
YYSTYPE (see <B>%union</B>). The result value of the action shall be
kept on the parse stack with the left-hand side of the rule,
to be accessed by other reductions as part of their right-hand side.
By using the &lt;<I>tag</I>&gt; information provided in the
declarations section, the code generated by <I>yacc</I> can be strictly
type checked and contain arbitrary information. In
addition, the lexical analyzer can provide the same kinds of values
for tokens, if desired.
<P>

An action is an arbitrary C statement and as such can do input or
output, call subprograms, and alter external variables. An
action is one or more C statements enclosed in curly braces <B>'{'</B>
and <B>'}'</B> .
<P>

Certain pseudo-variables can be used in the action. These are macros
for access to data structures known internally to
<I>yacc</I>.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>$$<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The value of the action can be set by assigning it to $$. If type
checking is enabled and the type of the value to be assigned
cannot be determined, a diagnostic message may be generated.
</DL>

<DT>$<I>number</I><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This refers to the value returned by the component specified by the
token <I>number</I> in the right side of a rule, reading
from left to right; <I>number</I> can be zero or negative. If <I>number</I>
is zero or negative, it refers to the data associated
with the name on the parser's stack preceding the leftmost symbol
of the current rule. (That is, <B>&quot;$0&quot;</B> refers to the name
immediately preceding the leftmost name in the current rule to be
found on the parser's stack and <B>&quot;$-1&quot;</B> refers to the
symbol to <I>its</I> left.) If <I>number</I> refers to an element past
the current point in the rule, or beyond the bottom of the
stack, the result is undefined. If type checking is enabled and the
type of the value to be assigned cannot be determined, a
diagnostic message may be generated.
</DL>

<DT>$&lt;<I>tag</I>&gt;<I>number</I><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
These correspond exactly to the corresponding symbols without the
<I>tag</I> inclusion, but allow for strict type checking (and
preclude unwanted type conversions). The effect is that the macro
is expanded to use <I>tag</I> to select an element from the
YYSTYPE union (using <I>dataname.tag</I>). This is particularly useful
if <I>number</I> is not positive.
</DL>

<DT>$&lt;<I>tag</I>&gt;$<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This imposes on the reference the type of the union member referenced
by <I>tag</I>. This construction is applicable when a
reference to a left context value occurs in the grammar, and provides
<I>yacc</I> with a means for selecting a type.
</DL>

<P>
</DL>
<P>

Actions can occur anywhere in a rule (not just at the end); an action
can access values returned by actions to its left, and in
turn the value it returns can be accessed by actions to its right.
An action appearing in the middle of a rule shall be equivalent
to replacing the action with a new non-terminal symbol and adding
an empty rule with that non-terminal symbol on the left-hand
side. The semantic action associated with the new rule shall be equivalent
to the original action. The use of actions within rules
might introduce conflicts that would not otherwise exist.
<P>

By default, the value of a rule shall be the value of the first element
in it. If the first element does not have a type
(particularly in the case of a literal) and type checking is turned
on by <B>%type</B>, an error message shall result.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>precedence</I><DD>
The keyword <B>%prec</B> can be used to change the precedence level
associated with a particular grammar rule. Examples of this
are in cases where a unary and binary operator have the same symbolic
representation, but need to be given different precedences,
or where the handling of an ambiguous if-else construction is necessary.
The reserved symbol <B>%prec</B> can appear immediately
after the body of the grammar rule and can be followed by a token
name or a literal. It shall cause the precedence of the grammar
rule to become that of the following token name or literal. The action
for the rule as a whole can follow <B>%prec</B>.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

If a program section follows, the application shall ensure that the
grammar rules are terminated by <B>%%</B>.
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Programs Section</H3>

<P>

The <I>programs</I> section can include the definition of the lexical
analyzer <I>yylex</I>(), and any other functions; for
example, those used in the actions specified in the grammar rules.
It is unspecified whether the programs section precedes or
follows the semantic actions in the output file; therefore, if the
application contains any macro definitions and declarations
intended to apply to the code in the semantic actions, it shall place
them within <B>&quot;%{&nbsp;...&nbsp;%}&quot;</B> in the
declarations section.
<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Input Grammar</H3>

<P>

The following input to <I>yacc</I> yields a parser for the input to
<I>yacc</I>. This formal syntax takes precedence over the
preceding text syntax description.
<P>

The lexical structure is defined less precisely; Lexical Structure
of the Grammar defines most

This corresponds to the concept of <I>name</I>, given previously. It
also includes literals as defined previously.
<DT><B>C_IDENTIFIER</B><DD>
This is a name, and additionally it is known to be followed by a colon.
A literal cannot yield this token.
<DT><B>NUMBER</B><DD>
A string of digits (a non-negative decimal integer).
<DT><B>TYPE</B>,&nbsp;<B>LEFT</B>,&nbsp;<B>MARK</B>,&nbsp;<B>LCURL</B>,&nbsp;<B>RCURL</B><DD>

<H3>Conflicts</H3>

<P>

The parser produced for an input grammar may contain states in which
conflicts occur. The conflicts occur because the grammar is
not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+LALR">LALR</A>(1). An ambiguous grammar always contains at least one <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+LALR">LALR</A>(1)
conflict. The <I>yacc</I> utility shall resolve all
conflicts, using either default rules or user-specified precedence
rules.
<P>

Conflicts are either shift/reduce conflicts or reduce/reduce conflicts.
A shift/reduce conflict is where, for a given state and
lookahead symbol, both a shift action and a reduce action are possible.
A reduce/reduce conflict is where, for a given state and
lookahead symbol, reductions by two different rules are possible.
<P>

The rules below describe how to specify what actions to take when
a conflict occurs. Not all shift/reduce conflicts can be
successfully resolved this way because the conflict may be due to
something other than ambiguity, so incautious use of these
facilities can cause the language accepted by the parser to be much
different from that which was intended. The description file
shall contain sufficient information to understand the cause of the
conflict. Where ambiguity is the reason either the default or
explicit rules should be adequate to produce a working parser.
<P>

The declared precedences and associativities (see Declarations Section
) are used to resolve
parsing conflicts as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1.<DD>
A precedence and associativity is associated with each grammar rule;
it is the precedence and associativity of the last token or
literal in the body of the rule. If the <B>%prec</B> keyword is used,
it overrides this default. Some grammar rules might not have
both precedence and associativity.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 2.<DD>
If there is a shift/reduce conflict, and both the grammar rule and
the input symbol have precedence and associativity associated
with them, then the conflict is resolved in favor of the action (shift
or reduce) associated with the higher precedence. If the
precedences are the same, then the associativity is used; left associative
implies reduce, right associative implies shift, and
non-associative implies an error in the string being parsed.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 3.<DD>
When there is a shift/reduce conflict that cannot be resolved by rule
2, the shift is done. Conflicts resolved this way are
counted in the diagnostic output described in Error Handling .
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 4.<DD>
When there is a reduce/reduce conflict, a reduction is done by the
grammar rule that occurs earlier in the input sequence.
Conflicts resolved this way are counted in the diagnostic output described
in Error Handling .
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Conflicts resolved by precedence or associativity shall not be counted
in the shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts reported
by <I>yacc</I> on either standard error or in the description file.
<A NAME="lbAZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Error Handling</H3>

<P>

The token <B>error</B> shall be reserved for error handling. The name
<B>error</B> can be used in grammar rules. It indicates
places where the parser can recover from a syntax error. The default
value of <B>error</B> shall be 256. Its value can be changed
using a <B>%token</B> declaration. The lexical analyzer should not
return the value of <B>error</B>.
<P>

The parser shall detect a syntax error when it is in a state where
the action associated with the lookahead symbol is
<B>error</B>. A semantic action can cause the parser to initiate error
handling by executing the macro YYERROR. When YYERROR is
executed, the semantic action passes control back to the parser. YYERROR
cannot be used outside of semantic actions.
<P>

When the parser detects a syntax error, it normally calls <I>yyerror</I>()
with the character string
<B>&quot;syntax&nbsp;error&quot;</B> as its argument. The call shall not be made
if the parser is still recovering from a previous error
when the error is detected. The parser is considered to be recovering
from a previous error until the parser has shifted over at
least three normal input symbols since the last error was detected
or a semantic action has executed the macro <I>yyerrok</I>. The
parser shall not call <I>yyerror</I>() when YYERROR is executed.
<P>

The macro function YYRECOVERING shall return 1 if a syntax error has
been detected and the parser has not yet fully recovered
from it. Otherwise, zero shall be returned.
<P>

When a syntax error is detected by the parser, the parser shall check
if a previous syntax error has been detected. If a
previous error was detected, and if no normal input symbols have been
shifted since the preceding error was detected, the parser
checks if the lookahead symbol is an endmarker (see Interface to the
Lexical Analyzer ). If it is,
the parser shall return with a non-zero value. Otherwise, the lookahead
symbol shall be discarded and normal parsing shall
resume.
<P>

When YYERROR is executed or when the parser detects a syntax error
and no previous error has been detected, or at least one
normal input symbol has been shifted since the previous error was
detected, the parser shall pop back one state at a time until the
parse stack is empty or the current state allows a shift over <B>error</B>.
If the parser empties the parse stack, it shall return
with a non-zero value. Otherwise, it shall shift over <B>error</B>
and then resume normal parsing. If the parser reads a lookahead
symbol before the error was detected, that symbol shall still be the
lookahead symbol when parsing is resumed.
<P>

The macro <I>yyerrok</I> in a semantic action shall cause the parser
to act as if it has fully recovered from any previous
errors. The macro <I>yyclearin</I> shall cause the parser to discard
the current lookahead token. If the current lookahead token
has not yet been read, <I>yyclearin</I> shall have no effect.
<P>

The macro YYACCEPT shall cause the parser to return with the value
zero. The macro YYABORT shall cause the parser to return with
a non-zero value.
<A NAME="lbBA">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Interface to the Lexical Analyzer</H3>

<P>

The <I>yylex</I>() function is an integer-valued function that returns
a <I>token number</I> representing the kind of token
read. If there is a value associated with the token returned by <I>yylex</I>()
(see the discussion of <I>tag</I> above), it shall
be assigned to the external variable <I>yylval</I>.
<P>

If the parser and <I>yylex</I>() do not agree on these token numbers,
reliable communication between them cannot occur. For
(single-byte character) literals, the token is simply the numeric
value of the character in the current character set. The numbers
for other tokens can either be chosen by <I>yacc</I>, or chosen by
the user. In either case, the <B>#define</B> construct of C is
used to allow <I>yylex</I>() to return these numbers symbolically.
The <B>#define</B> statements are put into the code file, and
the header file if that file is requested. The set of characters permitted
by <I>yacc</I> in an identifier is larger than that
permitted by C. Token names found to contain such characters shall
not be included in the <B>#define</B> declarations.
<P>

If the token numbers are chosen by <I>yacc</I>, the tokens other than
literals shall be assigned numbers greater than 256,
although no order is implied. A token can be explicitly assigned a
number by following its first appearance in the declarations
section with a number. Names and literals not defined this way retain
their default definition. All token numbers assigned by
<I>yacc</I> shall be unique and distinct from the token numbers used
for literals and user-assigned tokens. If duplicate token
numbers cause conflicts in parser generation, <I>yacc</I> shall report
an error; otherwise, it is unspecified whether the token
assignment is accepted or an error is reported.
<P>

The end of the input is marked by a special token called the <I>endmarker</I>,
which has a token number that is zero or
negative. (These values are invalid for any other token.) All lexical
analyzers shall return zero or negative as a token number
upon reaching the end of their input. If the tokens up to, but excluding,
the endmarker form a structure that matches the start
symbol, the parser shall accept the input. If the endmarker is seen
in any other context, it shall be considered an error.
<A NAME="lbBB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Completing the Program</H3>

<P>

In addition to <I>yyparse</I>() and <I>yylex</I>(), the functions <I>yyerror</I>()
and <I>main</I>() are required to make a
complete program. The application can supply <I>main</I>() and <I>yyerror</I>(),
or those routines can be obtained from the
<I>yacc</I> library.
<A NAME="lbBC">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Yacc Library</H3>

<P>

The following functions shall appear only in the <I>yacc</I> library
accessible through the <B>-l&nbsp;y</B> operand to <I>c99</I>; they can
therefore be redefined by a conforming application:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>int&nbsp;</B> <I>main</I>(<B>void</B>)<DD>
<P>
This function shall call <I>yyparse</I>() and exit with an unspecified
value. Other actions within this function are
unspecified.
<DT><B>int&nbsp;</B> <I>yyerror</I>(<B>const&nbsp;char</B>&nbsp;*<I>s</I>)<DD>
<P>
This function shall write the NUL-terminated argument to standard
error, followed by a &lt;newline&gt;.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The order of the <B>-l&nbsp;y</B> and <B>-l&nbsp;l</B> operands given to <I>c99</I>
is
significant; the application shall either provide its own <I>main</I>()
function or ensure that <B>-l&nbsp;y</B> precedes
<B>-l&nbsp;l</B>.
<A NAME="lbBD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Debugging the Parser</H3>

<P>

The parser generated by <I>yacc</I> shall have diagnostic facilities
in it that can be optionally enabled at either compile time
or at runtime (if enabled at compile time). The compilation of the
runtime debugging code is under the control of YYDEBUG, a
preprocessor symbol. If YYDEBUG has a non-zero value, the debugging
code shall be included. If its value is zero, the code shall
not be included.
<P>

In parsers where the debugging code has been included, the external
<B>int</B> <I>yydebug</I> can be used to turn debugging on
(with a non-zero value) and off (zero value) at runtime. The initial
value of <I>yydebug</I> shall be zero.
<P>

When <B>-t</B> is specified, the code file shall be built such that,
if YYDEBUG is not already defined at compilation time
(using the <I>c99</I> <B>-D</B> YYDEBUG option, for example), YYDEBUG
shall be set explicitly
to 1. When <B>-t</B> is not specified, the code file shall be built
such that, if YYDEBUG is not already defined, it shall be set
explicitly to zero.
<P>

The format of the debugging output is unspecified but includes at
least enough information to determine the shift and reduce
actions, and the input symbols. It also provides information about
error recovery.
<A NAME="lbBE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Algorithms</H3>

<P>

The parser constructed by <I>yacc</I> implements an <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+LALR">LALR</A>(1) parsing
algorithm as documented in the literature. It is unspecified
whether the parser is table-driven or direct-coded.
<P>

A parser generated by <I>yacc</I> shall never request an input symbol
from <I>yylex</I>() while in a state where the only
actions other than the error action are reductions by a single rule.
<P>

The literature of parsing theory defines these concepts.
<A NAME="lbBF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Limits</H3>

<P>

The <I>yacc</I> utility may have several internal tables. The minimum
maximums for these tables are shown in the following
table. The exact meaning of these values is implementation-defined.
The implementation shall define the relationship between these
values and between them and any error messages that the implementation
may generate should it run out of space for any internal
structure. An implementation may combine groups of these resources
into a single pool as long as the total available to the user
does not fall below the sum of the sizes specified by this section.

If any errors are encountered, the run is aborted and <I>yacc</I> exits

file shall always be produced if the <B>-v</B> flag is
present.
<P>

<I>The following sections are informative.</I>
<A NAME="lbBI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>APPLICATION USAGE</H2>

<P>

Historical implementations experience name conflicts on the names
<B>yacc.tmp</B>, <B>yacc.acts</B>, <B>yacc.debug</B>,
<B>y.tab.c</B>, <B>y.tab.h</B>, and <B>y.output</B> if more than one
copy of <I>yacc</I> is running in a single directory at one
time. The <B>-b</B> option was added to overcome this problem. The
related problem of allowing multiple <I>yacc</I> parsers to be
placed in the same file was addressed by adding a <B>-p</B> option
to override the previously hard-coded <B>yy</B> variable
prefix.
<P>

The description of the <B>-p</B> option specifies the minimal set of
function and variable names that cause conflict when
multiple parsers are linked together. YYSTYPE does not need to be
changed. Instead, the programmer can use <B>-b</B> to give the
header files for different parsers different names, and then the file
with the <I>yylex</I>() for a given parser can include the
header for that parser. Names such as <I>yyclearerr</I> do not need
to be changed because they are used only in the actions; they
do not have linkage. It is possible that an implementation has other
names, either internal ones for implementing things such as
<I>yyclearerr</I>, or providing non-standard features that it wants
to change with <B>-p</B>.
<P>

Unary operators that are the same token as a binary operator in general
need their precedence adjusted. This is handled by the
<B>%prec</B> advisory symbol associated with the particular grammar
rule defining that unary operator. (See Grammar Rules in yacc .) Applications
are not required to use this operator for unary operators, but the
grammars that do not require it are rare.

<A NAME="lbBK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RATIONALE</H2>

<P>

The references in may be helpful in constructing the parser generator.
The referenced DeRemer and Pennello article (along with
the works it references) describes a technique to generate parsers
that conform to this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
Work in this area continues to be done, so implementors should consult
current literature before doing any new implementations. The
original Knuth article is the theoretical basis for this kind of parser,
but the tables it generates are impractically large for
reasonable grammars and should not be used. The &quot;equivalent to&quot; wording
is intentional to assure that the best tables that are
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+LALR">LALR</A>(1) can be generated.
<P>

There has been confusion between the class of grammars, the algorithms
needed to generate parsers, and the algorithms needed to
parse the languages. They are all reasonably orthogonal. In particular,
a parser generator that accepts the full range of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+LR">LR</A>(1)
grammars need not generate a table any more complex than one that
accepts <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+SLR">SLR</A>(1) (a relatively weak class of LR grammars) for a
grammar that happens to be <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+SLR">SLR</A>(1). Such an implementation need not
recognize the case, either; table compression can yield the
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+SLR">SLR</A>(1) table (or one even smaller than that) without recognizing that
the grammar is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+SLR">SLR</A>(1). The speed of an <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+LR">LR</A>(1) parser for any
class is dependent more upon the table representation and compression
(or the code generation if a direct parser is generated) than
upon the class of grammar that the table generator handles.
<P>

The speed of the parser generator is somewhat dependent upon the class
of grammar it handles. However, the original Knuth
article algorithms for constructing LR parsers were judged by its
author to be impractically slow at that time. Although full LR is
more complex than <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+LALR">LALR</A>(1), as computer speeds and algorithms improve,
the difference (in terms of acceptable wall-clock execution
time) is becoming less significant.
<P>

Potential authors are cautioned that the referenced DeRemer and Pennello
article previously cited identifies a bug (an
over-simplification of the computation of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+LALR">LALR</A>(1) lookahead sets)
in some of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+LALR">LALR</A>(1) algorithm statements that preceded it to
publication. They should take the time to seek out that paper, as
well as current relevant work, particularly Aho's.
<P>

The <B>-b</B> option was added to provide a portable method for permitting
<I>yacc</I> to work on multiple separate parsers in
the same directory. If a directory contains more than one <I>yacc</I>
grammar, and both grammars are constructed at the same time
(by, for example, a parallel <I>make</I> program), conflict results.
While the solution is not
historical practice, it corrects a known deficiency in historical
implementations. Corresponding changes were made to all sections
that referenced the filenames <B>y.tab.c</B> (now &quot;the code file&quot;),
<B>y.tab.h</B> (now &quot;the header file&quot;), and <B>y.output</B>
(now &quot;the description file&quot;).
<P>

The grammar for <I>yacc</I> input is based on System V documentation.
The textual description shows there that the <B>';'</B>
is required at the end of the rule. The grammar and the implementation
do not require this. (The use of <B>C_IDENTIFIER</B> causes
a reduce to occur in the right place.)
<P>

Also, in that implementation, the constructs such as <B>%token</B>
can be terminated by a semicolon, but this is not permitted
by the grammar. The keywords such as <B>%token</B> can also appear
in uppercase, which is again not discussed. In most places where
<B>'%'</B> is used, <B>'\'</B> can be substituted, and there are alternate
spellings for some of the symbols (for example,
<B>%LEFT</B> can be <B>&quot;%&lt;&quot;</B> or even <B>&quot;\&lt;&quot;</B> ).
<P>

Historically, &lt;<I>tag</I>&gt; can contain any characters except <B>'&gt;'</B>,
including white space, in the
implementation. However, since the <I>tag</I> must reference an ISO&nbsp;C
standard union member, in practice conforming
implementations need to support only the set of characters for ISO&nbsp;C
standard identifiers in this context.
<P>

Some historical implementations are known to accept actions that are
terminated by a period. Historical implementations often
allow <B>'$'</B> in names. A conforming implementation does not need
to support either of these behaviors.
<P>

Deciding when to use <B>%prec</B> illustrates the difficulty in specifying
the behavior of <I>yacc</I>. There may be situations
in which the <I>grammar</I> is not, strictly speaking, in error, and
yet <I>yacc</I> cannot interpret it unambiguously. The
resolution of ambiguities in the grammar can in many instances be
resolved by providing additional information, such as using
<B>%type</B> or <B>%union</B> declarations. It is often easier and it
usually yields a smaller parser to take this alternative when
it is appropriate.
<P>

The size and execution time of a program produced without the runtime
debugging code is usually smaller and slightly faster in
historical implementations.
<P>

Statistics messages from several historical implementations include
the following types of information:

<P>

The report of internal tables in the description file is left implementation-defined
because all aspects of these limits are
also implementation-defined. Some implementations may use dynamic
allocation techniques and have no specific limit values to
report.
<P>

The format of the <B>y.output</B> file is not given because specification
of the format was not seen to enhance applications
portability. The listing is primarily intended to help human users
understand and debug the parser; use of <B>y.output</B> by a
conforming application script would be unusual. Furthermore, implementations
have not produced consistent output and no popular
format was apparent. The format selected by the implementation should
be human-readable, in addition to the requirement that it be
a text file.
<P>

Standard error reports are not specifically described because they
are seldom of use to conforming applications and there was no
reason to restrict implementations.
<P>

Some implementations recognize <B>&quot;={&quot;</B> as equivalent to <B>'{'</B>
because it appears in historical documentation. This
construction was recognized and documented as obsolete as long ago
as 1978, in the referenced <I>Yacc: Yet Another
Compiler-Compiler</I>. This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 chose
to leave it as obsolete and omit it.
<P>

Multi-byte characters should be recognized by the lexical analyzer
and returned as tokens. They should not be returned as
multi-byte character literals. The token <B>error</B> that is used
for error recovery is normally assigned the value 256 in the
historical implementation. Thus, the token value 256, which is used
in many multi-byte character sets, is not available for use as
the value of a user-defined token.
