<h1>NAME</h1> groff_out &#45; groff intermediate output format</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This manual page describes the <i>intermediate output</i> format of the GNU <b>roff</b>(7) text processing system <b>groff</b>(1). This output is produced by a run of the GNU <b>troff</b>(1) program. It contains already all device-specific information, but it is not yet fed into a device postprocessor program.<p>
As the GNU <i>roff</i> processor <b>groff</b>(1) is a wrapper program around <b>troff</b> that automatically calls a postprocessor, this output does not show up normally. This is why it is called <i>intermediate</i> within the <i>groff</i> <i>system</i>. The <b>groff</b> program provides the option <b>-Z</b> to inhibit postprocessing, such that the produced <i>intermediate output</i> is sent to standard output just like calling <b>troff</b> manually.<p>
In this document, the term <i>troff output</i> describes what is output by the GNU <b>troff</b> program, while <i>intermediate output</i> refers to the language that is accepted by the parser that prepares this output for the postprocessors. This parser is smarter on whitespace and implements obsolete elements for compatibility, otherwise both formats are the same. Both formats can be viewed directly with <b>gxditview</b>(1).<p>
The main purpose of the <i>intermediate output</i> concept is to facilitate the development of postprocessors by providing a common programming interface for all devices. It has a language of its own that is completely different from the <b>groff</b>(7) language. While the <i>groff</i> language is a high-level programming language for text processing, the <i>intermediate output</i> language is a kind of low-level assembler language by specifying all positions on the page for writing and drawing.<p>
The pre-<i>groff</i> <i>roff</i> versions are denoted as <i>classical</i> <i>troff</i>. The <i>intermediate output</i> produced by <b>groff</b> is fairly readable, while <i>classical troff</i> output was hard to understand because of strange habits that are still supported, but not used any longer by <i>GNU</i> <i>troff</i>.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>LANGUAGE CONCEPTS</h1> During the run of <b>troff</b>, the <i>roff</i> input is cracked down to the information on what has to be printed at what position on the intended device. So the language of the <i>intermediate output</i> format can be quite small. Its only elements are commands with or without arguments. In this document, the term "command" always refers to the <i>intermediate output</i> language, never to the <i>roff</i> language used for document formatting. There are commands for positioning and text writing, for drawing, and for device controlling.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Separation</h2> <i>Classical troff output</i> had strange requirements on whitespace. The <b>groff</b> output parser, however, is smart about whitespace by making it maximally optional. The whitespace characters, i.e., the <i>tab</i>, <i>space</i>, and <i>newline</i> characters, always have a syntactical meaning. They are never printable because spacing within the output is always done by positioning commands.<p>
Any sequence of <i>space</i> or <i>tab</i> characters is treated as a single <i>syntactical</i> <i>space</i>. It separates commands and arguments, but is only required when there would occur a clashing between the command code and the arguments without the space. Most often, this happens when variable length command names, arguments, argument lists, or command clusters meet. Commands and arguments with a known, fixed length need not be separated by <i>syntactical</i> <i>space</i>.<p>
A line break is a syntactical element, too. Every command argument can be followed by whitespace, a comment, or a newline character. Thus a <i>syntactical line break</i> is defined to consist of optional <i>syntactical space</i> that is optionally followed by a comment, and a newline character.<p>
The normal commands, those for positioning and text, consist of a single letter taking a fixed number of arguments. For historical reasons, the parser allows to stack such commands on the same line, but fortunately, in <i>groff intermediate</i> <i>output</i>, every command with at least one argument is followed by a line break, thus providing excellent readability.<p>
The other commands &#8212; those for drawing and device controlling &#8212; have a more complicated structure; some recognize long command names, and some take a variable number of arguments. So all <b>D</b> and <b>x</b> commands were designed to request a <i>syntactical line break</i> after their last argument. Only one command, `<b>x&#160;X</b>' has an argument that can stretch over several lines, all other commands must have all of their arguments on the same line as the command, i.e., the arguments may not be splitted by a line break.<p>
Empty lines, i.e., lines containing only space and/or a comment, can occur everywhere. They are just ignored.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Argument Units</h2> Some commands take integer arguments that are assumed to represent values in a measurement unit, but the letter for the corresponding <i>scale indicator</i> is not written with the output command arguments; see <b>groff</b>(7) and the <i>groff info file</i> for more on this topic. Most commands assume the scale indicator&#160;<b>$@</b> the basic unit of the device, some use&#160;<b>$@</b> the <i>scaled point unit</i> of the device, while others, such as the color commands expect plain integers. Note that these scale indicators are relative to the chosen device. They are defined by the parameters specified in the device's <i>DESC</i> file; see <b>groff_font</b>(5).<p>
Note that single characters can have the eighth bit set, as can the names of fonts and special characters. The names of characters and fonts can be of arbitrary length. A character that is to be printed will always be in the current font.<p>
A string argument is always terminated by the next whitespace character (space, tab, or newline); an embedded <b>#</b> character is regarded as part of the argument, not as the beginning of a comment command. An integer argument is already terminated by the next non-digit character, which then is regarded as the first character of the next argument or command.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Document Parts</h2> A correct <i>intermediate output</i> document consists of two parts, the <i>prologue</i> and the <i>body</i>.<p>
The task of the <i>prologue</i> is to set the general device parameters using three exactly specified commands. The <i>groff prologue</i> is guaranteed to consist of the following three lines (in that order):<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<p>
<b>x&#160;T</b> <i>device</i><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>x&#160;res</b> <i>n&#160;h&#160;v</i><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>x init</b></div>
<p>
with the arguments set as outlined in the section <b>Device Control Commands</b>. But the parser for the <i>intermediate output</i> format is able to swallow additional whitespace and comments as well.<p>
The <i>body</i> is the main section for processing the document data. Syntactically, it is a sequence of any commands different from the ones used in the <i>prologue</i>. Processing is terminated as soon as the first <b>x&#160;stop</b> command is encountered; the last line of any <i>groff intermediate output</i> always contains such a command.<p>
Semantically, the <i>body</i> is page oriented. A new page is started by a <b>p</b>&#160;command. Positioning, writing, and drawing commands are always done within the current page, so they cannot occur before the first <b>p</b>&#160;command. Absolute positioning (by the <b>H</b> and <b>V</b>&#160;commands) is done relative to the current page, all other positioning is done relative to the current location within this page.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>COMMAND REFERENCE</h1> This section describes all <i>intermediate output</i> commands, the classical commands as well as the <i>groff</i> extensions.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Comment Command</h2><dl>
<dt>
<b>#</b><i>anything</i><b>&#60;end_of_line&#62;</b></dt>
<dd>
A comment. Ignore any characters from the <b>#</b>&#160;character up to the next newline character.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
This command is the only possibility for commenting in the <i>intermediate</i> <i>output</i>. Each comment can be preceded by arbitrary <i>syntactical</i> <i>space</i>; every command can be terminated by a comment.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Simple Commands</h2> The commands in this subsection have a command code consisting of a single character, taking a fixed number of arguments. Most of them are commands for positioning and text writing. These commands are smart about whitespace. Optionally, <i>syntactical space</i> can be inserted before, after, and between the command letter and its arguments. All of these commands are stackable, i.e., they can be preceded by other simple commands or followed by arbitrary other commands on the same line. A separating <i>syntactical space</i> is only necessary when two integer arguments would clash or if the preceding argument ends with a string argument. Open a new environment by copying the actual device configuration data to the environment stack. The current environment is setup by the device specification and manipulated by the setting commands.<dl>
<dt>
<b></b>&#160;<i>,/</i>$*</dt>

Close the actual environment (opened by a preceding <b>{</b>&#160;command) and restore the previous environment from the environment stack as the actual device configuration data. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b></b>&#160;<i>,/</i>$*</dt>
<dd>
Print a special groff character named <i>$@</i> The trailing <i>syntactical space</i> or <i>line break</i> is necessary to allow character names of arbitrary length. The character is printed at the current print position; the character's size is read from the font file. The print position is not changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b></b>&#160;<i>,/</i>$*</dt>
<dd>
Print character&#160;<i>$@</i> at the current print position; the character's size is read from the font file. The print position is not changed.</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b></b>&#160;<i>,/</i>$*</dt>
<dd>
Move <i>$@</i> (a non-negative integer) basic units&#160;<b>$@</b> horizontally to the right. <i>[CSTR&#160;#54]</i> allows negative values for <i>n</i> also, but <i>groff</i> doesn't use this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b></b>&#160;<i>,/</i>$*</dt>
<dd>
Set the color for text (glyphs), line drawing, and the outline of graphic objects using different color schemes; the analoguous command for the filling color of graphic objects is <b>DF</b>. The color components are specified as integer arguments between 0 and 65536. The number of color components and their meaning vary for the different color schemes. These commands are generated by the <i>groff</i> escape sequence <b>&#92;m</b>. No position changing. These commands are a <i>groff</i> extension.</dd>

</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b></b>&#160;<i>,/</i>$*</dt>
<dd>
Print character with index&#160;<i>$@</i> (an integer, normally non-negative) of the current font. The print position is not changed. If <b>&#45;T&#160;html</b> is used, negative values are emitted also to indicate an unbreakable space with given width. For example, <b>N&#160;-193</b> represents an unbreakable space which has a width of 193u. This command is a <i>groff</i> extension.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b></b>&#160;<i>,/</i>$*</dt>
<dd>
Inform the device about a line break, but no positioning is done by this command. In <i>classical</i> <i>troff</i>, the integer arguments <i>$@</i> and&#160;<i>$@</i> informed about the space before and after the current line to make the <i>intermediate output</i> more human readable without performing any action. In <i>groff</i>, they are just ignored, but they must be provided for compatibility reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b></b>&#160;<i>,/</i>$*</dt>
<dd>
Begin a new page in the outprint. The page number is set to&#160;<i>$@</i> This page is completely independent of pages formerly processed even if those have the same page number. The vertical position on the outprint is automatically set to&#160;0. All positioning, writing, and drawing is always done relative to a page, so a <b>p</b>&#160;command must be issued before any of these commands.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b></b>&#160;<i>,/</i>$*</dt>
<dd>
Set point size to <i>$@</i> scaled points (this is unit&#160;<b>$@</b> in GNU <b>troff</b>). <i>Classical troff</i> used the unit <i>points</i> (<b>$@</b> instead; see section <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>.</dd>

<dt>
Print a word, i.e., a sequence of characters</dt>
<dd>
<i>$@</i> terminated by a space character or a line break; an optional second integer argument is ignored (this allows the formatter to generate an even number of arguments). The first character should be printed at the current position, the current horizontal position should then be increased by the width of the first character, and so on for each character. The widths of the characters are read from the font file, scaled for the current point size, and rounded to a multiple of the horizontal resolution. Special characters cannot be printed using this command (use the <b>C</b> command for named characters). This command is a <i>groff</i> extension; it is only used for devices whose <i>DESC</i> file contains the <b>tcommand</b> keyword; see <b>groff_font</b>(5).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b></b>&#160;<i>,/</i>$*</dt>
<dd>
Print word with track kerning. This is the same as the <b>t</b> command except that after printing each character, the current horizontal position is increased by the sum of the width of that character and&#160;<i>$@</i> (an integer in basic units&#160;<b>$@</b> This command is a <i>groff</i> extension; it is only used for devices whose <i>DESC</i> file contains the <b>tcommand</b> keyword; see <b>groff_font</b>(5).</dd>

<dd>
Move down to the absolute vertical position&#160;<i>$@</i> (a non-negative integer in basic units&#160;<b>$@</b> relative to upper edge of current page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b></b>&#160;<i>,/</i>$*</dt>
<dd>
Move <i>$@</i> basic units&#160;<b>$@</b> down (<i>n</i> is a non-negative integer). <i>[CSTR&#160;#54]</i> allows negative values for <i>n</i> also, but <i>groff</i> doesn't use this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

<dd>
Informs about a paddable whitespace to increase readability. The spacing itself must be performed explicitly by a move command.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Graphics Commands</h2> Each graphics or drawing command in the <i>intermediate output</i> starts with the letter&#160;<b>D</b> followed by one or two characters that specify a subcommand; this is followed by a fixed or variable number of integer arguments that are separated by a single space character. A <b>D</b>&#160;command may not be followed by another command on the same line (apart from a comment), so each <b>D</b>&#160;command is terminated by a <i>syntactical line</i> <i>break</i>.<p>
<b>troff</b> output follows the classical spacing rules (no space between command and subcommand, all arguments are preceded by a single space character), but the parser allows optional space between the command letters and makes the space before the first argument optional. As usual, each space can be any sequence of tab and space characters.<p>
Some graphics commands can take a variable number of arguments. In this case, they are integers representing a size measured in basic units&#160;<b>$@</b> The arguments called <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>n</i> stand for horizontal distances where positive means right, negative left. The arguments called <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>n</i> stand for vertical distances where positive means down, negative up. All these distances are offsets relative to the current location.<p>
Unless indicated otherwise, each graphics command directly corresponds to a similar <i>groff</i> <b>&#92;D</b> escape sequence; see <b>groff</b>(7).<p>
Unknown <b>D</b>&#160;commands are assumed to be device-specific. Its arguments are parsed as strings; the whole information is then sent to the postprocessor.<p>
In the following command reference, the syntax element <i>&#60;line_break&#62;</i> means a <i>syntactical line break</i> as defined in section <b>Separation</b>.<dl>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Device Control Commands</h2> Each device control command starts with the letter <b>x</b> followed by a space character (optional or arbitrary space/:tab in <i>groff</i>) and a subcommand letter or word; each argument (if any) must be preceded by a <i>syntactical</i> <i>space</i>. All <b>x</b> commands are terminated by a <i>syntactical line break</i>; no device control command can be followed by another command on the same line (except a comment).<p>
The subcommand is basically a single letter, but to increase readability, it can be written as a word, i.e., an arbitrary sequence of characters terminated by the next tab, space, or newline character. All characters of the subcommand word but the first are simply ignored. For example, <b>troff</b> outputs the initialization command <b>x&#160;i</b> as <b>x&#160;init</b> and the resolution command <b>x&#160;r</b> as <b>x&#160;res</b>. But writings like <b>x&#160;i_like_groff</b> and <b>x&#160;roff_is_groff</b> resp. are accepted as well to mean the same commands.<p>
In the following, the syntax element <i>&#60;line_break&#62;</i> means a <i>syntactical line break</i> as defined in section <b>Separation</b>.<dl>

The same applies to all following lines until the first character of a line is not a <b>+</b> character. This command is generated by the <i>groff</i> escape sequence <b>&#92;X</b>. The line-continuing feature is a <i>groff</i> extension.</dd>

<h2>Obsolete Command</h2> In <i>classical troff</i> output, the writing of a single character was mostly done by a very strange command that combined a horizontal move and the printing of a character. It didn't have a command code, but is represented by a 3-character argument consisting of exactly 2&#160;digits and a character.<dl>
<dt>
<i>$@</i></dt>
<dd>
Move right <i>$@</i> (exactly two decimal digits) basic units&#160;<b>$@</b> then print character&#160;<i>$@</i></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<p>
In <i>groff</i>, arbitrary <i>syntactical space</i> around and within this command is allowed to be added. Only when a preceding command on the same line ends with an argument of variable length a separating space is obligatory. In <i>classical</i> <i>troff</i>, large clusters of these and other commands were used, mostly without spaces; this made such output almost unreadable.</div>
<p>
For modern high-resolution devices, this command does not make sense because the width of the characters can become much larger than two decimal digits. In <b>groff</b>, this is only used for the devices <b>X75</b>, <b>X75-12</b>, <b>X100</b>, and <b>X100-12</b>. For other devices, the commands <b>t</b> and&#160;<b>u</b> provide a better functionality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>POSTPROCESSING</h1> The <i>roff</i> postprocessors are programs that have the task to translate the <i>intermediate output</i> into actions that are sent to a device. A device can be some piece of hardware such as a printer, or a software file format suitable for graphical or text processing. The <i>groff</i> system provides powerful means that make the programming of such postprocessors an easy task.<p>
There is a library function that parses the <i>intermediate output</i> and sends the information obtained to the device via methods of a class with a common interface for each device. So a <i>groff</i> postprocessor must only redefine the methods of this class. For details, see the reference in section <b>FILES</b>.</div>

As a computer monitor has a very low resolution compared to modern printers the <i>intermediate output</i> for the X&#160;devices can use the jump-and-write command with its 2-digit displacements.<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>COMPATIBILITY</h1> The <i>intermediate output</i> language of the <i>classical troff</i> was first documented in <i>[CSTR&#160;#97]</i>. The <i>groff intermediate output</i> format is compatible with this specification except for the following features.<dl>
<dt>
The classical quasi device independence is not yet implemented.</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
The old hardware was very different from what we use today.</dt>
<dd>
So the <i>groff</i> devices are also fundamentally different from the ones in <i>classical</i> <i>troff</i>. For example, the classical PostScript device was called <i>post</i> and had a resolution of 720 units per inch, while <i>groff</i>'s <i>ps</i> device has a resolution of 72000 units per inch. Maybe, by implementing some rescaling mechanism similar to the classical quasi device independence, these could be integrated into modern <i>groff</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
The B-spline command</dt>
<dd>
<b>D~</b> is correctly handled by the <i>intermediate output</i> parser, but the drawing routines aren't implemented in some of the postprocessor programs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
The argument of the commands</dt>
<dd>
<b>s</b> and <b>x H</b> has the implicit unit scaled point&#160;<b>$@</b> in <i>groff</i>, while <i>classical troff</i> had point (<b>$@</b> This isn't an incompatibility, but a compatible extension, for both units coincide for all devices without a <i>sizescale</i> parameter, including all classical and the <i>groff</i> text devices. The few <i>groff</i> devices with a sizescale parameter either did not exist, had a different name, or seem to have had a different resolution. So conflicts with classical devices are very unlikely. The position changing after the commands <b>Dp</b>, <b>DP</b>, and <b>Dt</b> is illogical, but as old versions of groff used this feature it is kept for compatibility reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Temporarily, there existed some confusion on the positioning after the</dt>
<dd>
<b>D</b> commands that are <i>groff</i> extensions. This has been clarified by establishing the classical rule for all groff drawing commands:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<p>
The position after a graphic object has been drawn is at its end; for circles and ellipses, the "end" is at the right side.</div>
<p>
From this, the positionings specified for the drawing commands above follow quite naturally.<p>
The differences between <i>groff</i> and <i>classical troff</i> are documented in <b>groff_diff</b>(7).</div>
