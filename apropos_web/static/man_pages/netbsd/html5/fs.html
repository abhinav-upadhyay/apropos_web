The block size and number of blocks which comprise a file system are parameters of the file system. Sectors beginning at <span class="define">BBLOCK</span> and continuing for <span class="define">BBSIZE</span> are used for a disklabel and for some hardware primary and secondary bootstrapping programs.<p>
The actual file system begins at sector <span class="define">SBLOCK</span> with the <span class="emph">super-block</span> that is of size <span class="define">SBSIZE</span>. The following structure described the super-block and is from the file <b class="includes">&lt;<a class="link-includes">ufs/ffs/fs.h</a>&gt;</b>:<p>

<p>
Each disk drive contains some number of file systems. A file system consists of a number of cylinder groups. Each cylinder group has inodes and data.<p>
A file system is described by its super-block, which in turn describes the cylinder groups. The super-block is critical data and is replicated in each cylinder group to protect against catastrophic loss. This is done at file system creation time and the critical super-block data does not change, so the copies need not be referenced further unless disaster strikes.<p>
Addresses stored in inodes are capable of addressing fragments of `blocks'. File system blocks of at most size <span class="define">MAXBSIZE</span> can be optionally broken into 2, 4, or 8 pieces, each of which is addressable; these pieces may be <span class="define">DEV_BSIZE</span>, or some multiple of a <span class="define">DEV_BSIZE</span> unit.<p>
Large files consist of exclusively large data blocks. To avoid undue wasted disk space, the last data block of a small file is allocated as only as many fragments of a large block as are necessary. The file system format retains only a single pointer to such a fragment, which is a piece of a single large block that has been divided. The size of such a fragment is determinable from information in the inode, using the <b class="fname">blksize</b>(<i class="farg">fs</i>, <i class="farg">ip</i>, <i class="farg">lbn</i>) macro.<p>
The file system records space availability at the fragment level; to determine block availability, aligned fragments are examined.<p>
The root inode is the root of the file system. Inode 0 can't be used for normal purposes and historically bad blocks were linked to inode 1, thus the root inode is 2 (inode 1 is no longer used for this purpose, however numerous dump tapes make this assumption, so we are stuck with it).<p>
The <i class="farg">fs_minfree</i> element gives the minimum acceptable percentage of file system blocks that may be free. If the freelist drops below this level only the super-user may continue to allocate blocks. The <i class="farg">fs_minfree</i> element may be set to 0 if no reserve of free blocks is deemed necessary, however severe performance degradations will be observed if the file system is run at greater than 90% full; thus the default value of <i class="farg">fs_minfree</i> is 10%.<p>
Empirically the best trade-off between block fragmentation and overall disk utilization at a loading of 90% comes with a fragmentation of 8, thus the default fragment size is an eighth of the block size.<p>
The element <i class="farg">fs_optim</i> specifies whether the file system should try to minimize the time spent allocating blocks, or if it should attempt to minimize the space fragmentation on the disk. If the value of fs_minfree (see above) is less than 10%, then the file system defaults to optimizing for space to avoid running out of full sized blocks. If the value of minfree is greater than or equal to 10%, fragmentation is unlikely to be problematical, and the file system defaults to optimizing for time.<p>
<span class="emph">Cylinder group related limits</span>: Each cylinder keeps track of the availability of blocks at different rotational positions, so that sequential blocks can be laid out with minimum rotational latency. With the default of 8 distinguished rotational positions, the resolution of the summary information is 2ms for a typical 3600 rpm drive.<p>
The element <i class="farg">fs_rotdelay</i> gives the minimum number of milliseconds to initiate another disk transfer on the same cylinder. It is used in determining the rotationally optimal layout for disk blocks within a file; the default value for <i class="farg">fs_rotdelay</i> is 2ms.<p>
Each file system has a statically allocated number of inodes, determined by its size and the desired number of file data bytes per inode at the time it was created.  See <a class="link-man" href="../8/newfs">newfs(8)</a> for details on how to set this (and other) filesystem parameters. By default, the inode allocation strategy is extremely conservative.<p>
<span class="define">MINBSIZE</span> is the smallest allowable block size. With a <span class="define">MINBSIZE</span> of 4096 it is possible to create files of size 2^32 with only two levels of indirection. <span class="define">MINBSIZE</span> must be big enough to hold a cylinder group block, thus changes to (<i class="farg">struct cg</i>) must keep its size within <span class="define">MINBSIZE</span>. Note that super-blocks are never more than size <span class="define">SBSIZE</span>.<p>
The path name on which the file system is mounted is maintained in <i class="farg">fs_fsmnt</i>. <span class="define">MAXMNTLEN</span> defines the amount of space allocated in the super-block for this name. The limit on the amount of summary information per file system is defined by <span class="define">MAXCSBUFS</span>. For a 4096 byte block size, it is currently parameterized for a maximum of two million cylinders.<p>
Per cylinder group information is summarized in blocks allocated from the first cylinder group's data blocks. These blocks are read in from <i class="farg">fs_csaddr</i> (size <i class="farg">fs_cssize</i>) in addition to the super-block.<p>
<span class="symb">N.B.:</span> <b class="fname">sizeof</b>(<i class="farg">struct csum</i>) must be a power of two in order for the <b class="fname">fs_cs</b>() macro to work.<p>
The <span class="emph">Super-block for a file system</span>: The size of the rotational layout tables is limited by the fact that the super-block is of size <span class="define">SBSIZE</span>. The size of these tables is <span class="emph">inversely</span> proportional to the block size of the file system. The size of the tables is increased when sector sizes are not powers of two, as this increases the number of cylinders included before the rotational pattern repeats (<i class="farg">fs_cpc</i>). The size of the rotational layout tables is derived from the number of bytes remaining in (<i class="farg">struct fs</i>).<p>
The number of blocks of data per cylinder group is limited because cylinder groups are at most one block. The inode and free block tables must fit into a single block after deducting space for the cylinder group structure (<i class="farg">struct cg</i>).<p>
The <span class="emph">Inode</span>: The inode is the focus of all file activity in the <span class="unix">UNIX</span> file system. There is a unique inode allocated for each active file, each current directory, each mounted-on file, text file, and the root. An inode is `named' by its device/i-number pair.
