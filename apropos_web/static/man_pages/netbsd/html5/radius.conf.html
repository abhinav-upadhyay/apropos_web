<h1 id="x53594e4f50534953">SYNOPSIS</h1> <i class="file">/etc/radius.conf</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x4445534352495054494f4e">DESCRIPTION</h1> <b class="name">radius.conf</b> contains the information necessary to configure the RADIUS client library. It is parsed by <a class="link-man" href="../html3/rad_config.html">rad_config(3)</a>. The file contains one or more lines of text, each describing a single RADIUS server which will be used by the library. Leading white space is ignored, as are empty lines and lines containing only comments.<p>
A RADIUS server is described by three to five fields on a line:<p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="list list-item">
<li class="list-item" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
Service type</li>
<li class="list-item" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
Server host</li>
<li class="list-item" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
Shared secret</li>
<li class="list-item" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
Timeout</li>
<li class="list-item" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
Retries</li>
</ul>
<p>
The fields are separated by white space. The &#8216;<code class="lit">#</code>&#8217; character at the beginning of a field begins a comment, which extends to the end of the line. A field may be enclosed in double quotes, in which case it may contain white space and/or begin with the &#8216;<code class="lit">#</code>&#8217; character. Within a quoted string, the double quote character can be represented by &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;"</code>&#8217;, and the backslash can be represented by &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;&#92;</code>&#8217;. No other escape sequences are supported.<p>
The first field gives the service type, either &#8216;<code class="lit">auth</code>&#8217; for RADIUS authentication or &#8216;<code class="lit">acct</code>&#8217; for RADIUS accounting. If a single server provides both services, two lines are required in the file. Earlier versions of this file did not include a service type. For backward compatibility, if the first field is not &#8216;<code class="lit">auth</code>&#8217; or &#8216;<code class="lit">acct</code>&#8217; the library behaves as if &#8216;<code class="lit">auth</code>&#8217; were specified, and interprets the fields in the line as if they were fields two through five.<p>
The second field specifies the server host, either as a fully qualified domain name or as a dotted-quad IP address. The host may optionally be followed by a &#8216;<code class="lit">:</code>&#8217; and a numeric port number, without intervening white space. If the port specification is omitted, it defaults to the &#8216;<code class="lit">radius</code>&#8217; or &#8216;<code class="lit">radacct</code>&#8217; service in the <i class="file">/etc/services</i> file for service types &#8216;<code class="lit">auth</code>&#8217; and &#8216;<code class="lit">acct</code>&#8217;, respectively. If no such entry is present, the standard ports 1812 and 1813 are used.<p>
The third field contains the shared secret, which should be known only to the client and server hosts. It is an arbitrary string of characters, though it must be enclosed in double quotes if it contains white space. The shared secret may be any length, but the RADIUS protocol uses only the first 128 characters. N.B., some popular RADIUS servers have bugs which prevent them from working properly with secrets longer than 16 characters.<p>
The fourth field contains a decimal integer specifying the timeout in seconds for receiving a valid reply from the server. If this field is omitted, it defaults to 3 seconds.<p>
The fifth field contains a decimal integer specifying the maximum number of attempts that will be made to authenticate with the server before giving up. If omitted, it defaults to 3 attempts. Note, this is the total number of attempts and not the number of retries.<p>
Up to 10 RADIUS servers may be specified for each service type. The servers are tried in round-robin fashion, until a valid response is received or the maximum number of tries has been reached for all servers.<p>
The standard location for this file is <i class="file">/etc/radius.conf</i>. But an alternate pathname may be specified in the call to <a class="link-man" href="../html3/rad_config.html">rad_config(3)</a>. Since the file contains sensitive information in the form of the shared secrets, it should not be readable except by root.</div>
