<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br>
<b>postconf</b> <i>parameter</i> ...<p>
<br>
<b>postconf -e</b> "<i>parameter=value</i>" ...</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1><br>
The Postfix main.cf configuration file specifies parameters that control the operation of the Postfix mail system. Typically the file contains only a small subset of all parameters; parameters not specified are left at their default values.<p>
The general format of the main.cf file is as follows:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Each logical line has the form "parameter = value". Whitespace around the "=" is ignored, as is whitespace at the end of a logical line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that starts with whitespace continues a logical line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A parameter value may refer to other parameters.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The expressions "$name", "${name}" or "$(name)" are recursively replaced by the value of the named parameter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The expression "${name?value}" expands to "value" when "$name" is non-empty. This form is supported with Postfix version 2.2 and later.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The expression "${name:value}" expands to "value" when "$name" is empty. This form is supported with Postfix version 2.2 and later.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Specify "$$" to produce a single "$" character.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When the same parameter is defined multiple times, only the last instance is remembered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Otherwise, the order of main.cf parameter definitions does not matter.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The remainder of this document is a description of all Postfix configuration parameters. Default values are shown after the parameter name in parentheses, and can be looked up with the " <b>postconf -d</b>" command.<p>
Note: this is not an invitation to make changes to Postfix configuration parameters. Unnecessary changes can impair the operation of the mail system.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>2bounce_notice_recipient (default: postmaster)</h1> The recipient of undeliverable mail that cannot be returned to the sender.  This feature is enabled with the notify_classes parameter.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>access_map_defer_code (default: 450)</h1> The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code for an  <b>access</b>(5) map "defer" action, including "defer_if_permit" or "defer_if_reject". Prior to Postfix 2.6, the response is hard-coded as "450".<p>
Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>access_map_reject_code (default: 554)</h1> The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code for an  <b>access</b>(5) map "reject" action.<p>
Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_cache_cleanup_interval (default: 12h)</h1> The amount of time between  <b>verify</b>(8) address verification database cleanup runs. This feature requires that the database supports the "delete" and "sequence" operators.  Specify a zero interval to disable database cleanup.<p>
After each database cleanup run, the <b>verify</b>(8) daemon logs the number of entries that were retained and dropped. A cleanup run is logged as "partial" when the daemon terminates early after " <b>postfix</b>  <b>reload</b>", "<b>postfix stop</b>", or no requests for $max_idle seconds.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.7.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_default_transport (default: $default_transport)</h1> Overrides the default_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_local_transport (default: $local_transport)</h1> Overrides the local_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_map (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> Lookup table for persistent address verification status storage.  The table is maintained by the  <b>verify</b>(8) service, and is opened before the process releases privileges.<p>
The lookup table is persistent by default (Postfix 2.7 and later). Specify an empty table name to keep the information in volatile memory which is lost after " <b>postfix reload</b>" or "<b>postfix</b>  <b>stop</b>". This is the default with Postfix version 2.6 and earlier.<p>
Specify a location in a file system that will not fill up. If the database becomes corrupted, the world comes to an end. To recover delete (NOT: truncate) the file and do " <b>postfix reload</b>".<p>
Postfix daemon processes do not use root privileges when opening this file (Postfix 2.5 and later).  The file must therefore be stored under a Postfix-owned directory such as the data_directory. As a migration aid, an attempt to open the file under a non-Postfix directory is redirected to the Postfix-owned data_directory, and a warning is logged.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
address_verify_map = hash:/var/db/postfix/verify<br>
address_verify_map = btree:/var/db/postfix/verify<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_negative_cache (default: yes)</h1> Enable caching of failed address verification probe results.  When this feature is enabled, the cache may pollute quickly with garbage. When this feature is disabled, Postfix will generate an address probe for every lookup.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_negative_expire_time (default: 3d)</h1> The time after which a failed probe expires from the address verification cache.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_negative_refresh_time (default: 3h)</h1> The time after which a failed address verification probe needs to be refreshed.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_poll_count (default: normal: 3, overload: 1)</h1> How many times to query the  <b>verify</b>(8) service for the completion of an address verification request in progress.<p>
By default, the Postfix SMTP server polls the <b>verify</b>(8) service up to three times under non-overload conditions, and only once when under overload.  With Postfix version 2.5 and earlier, the SMTP server always polls the  <b>verify</b>(8) service up to three times by default.<p>
Specify 1 to implement a crude form of greylisting, that is, always defer the first delivery request for a new address.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
# Postfix &lt;= 2.6 default<br>
address_verify_poll_count = 3<br>
# Poor man's greylisting<br>
address_verify_poll_count = 1<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_poll_delay (default: 3s)</h1> The delay between queries for the completion of an address verification request in progress.<p>
The default polling delay is 3 seconds.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_positive_expire_time (default: 31d)</h1> The time after which a successful probe expires from the address verification cache.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_positive_refresh_time (default: 7d)</h1> The time after which a successful address verification probe needs to be refreshed.  The address verification status is not updated when the probe fails (optimistic caching).<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_relay_transport (default: $relay_transport)</h1> Overrides the relay_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_relayhost (default: $relayhost)</h1> Overrides the relayhost parameter setting for address verification probes. This information can be overruled with the  <b>transport</b>(5) table.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_sender (default: $double_bounce_sender)</h1> The sender address to use in address verification probes; prior to Postfix 2.5 the default was "postmaster". To avoid problems with address probes that are sent in response to address probes, the Postfix SMTP server excludes the probe sender address from all SMTPD access blocks.<p>
Specify an empty value (address_verify_sender =) or &lt;&gt; if you want to use the null sender address. Beware, some sites reject mail from &lt;&gt;, even though RFCs require that such addresses be accepted.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
address_verify_sender = &lt;&gt;<br>
address_verify_sender = postmaster@my.domain<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_sender_dependent_default_transport_maps (default: $sender_dependent_default_transport_maps)</h1> Overrides the sender_dependent_default_transport_maps parameter setting for address verification probes.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_sender_dependent_relayhost_maps (default: $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps)</h1> Overrides the sender_dependent_relayhost_maps parameter setting for address verification probes.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_sender_ttl (default: 0s)</h1> The time between changes in the time-dependent portion of address verification probe sender addresses. The time-dependent portion is appended to the localpart of the address specified with the address_verify_sender parameter. This feature is ignored when the probe sender addresses is the null sender, i.e. the address_verify_sender value is empty or &lt;&gt;.<p>
Historically, the probe sender address was fixed. This has caused such addresses to end up on spammer mailing lists, and has resulted in wasted network and processing resources.<p>
To enable time-dependent probe sender addresses, specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the time unit).  Specify a value of at least several hours, to avoid problems with senders that use greylisting. Avoid nice TTL values, to make the result less predictable.  Time units are: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_service_name (default: verify)</h1> The name of the  <b>verify</b>(8) address verification service. This service maintains the status of sender and/or recipient address verification probes, and generates probes on request by other Postfix processes.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_transport_maps (default: $transport_maps)</h1> Overrides the transport_maps parameter setting for address verification probes.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>address_verify_virtual_transport (default: $virtual_transport)</h1> Overrides the virtual_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>alias_database (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> The alias databases for  <b>local</b>(8) delivery that are updated with " <b>newaliases</b>" or with "<b>sendmail -bi</b>".<p>
This is a separate configuration parameter because not all the tables specified with $alias_maps have to be local files.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases<br>
alias_database = hash:/etc/mail/aliases<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>alias_maps (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> The alias databases that are used for  <b>local</b>(8) delivery. See  <b>aliases</b>(5) for syntax details.<p>
The default list is system dependent.  On systems with NIS, the default is to search the local alias database, then the NIS alias database.<p>
If you change the alias database, run "<b>postalias /etc/aliases</b>" (or wherever your system stores the mail alias file), or simply run " <b>newaliases</b>" to build the necessary DBM or DB file.<p>
The <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution of $1 etc. in alias_maps, because that would open a security hole.<p>
The <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent will silently ignore requests to use the  <b>proxymap</b>(8) server within alias_maps. Instead it will open the table directly. Before Postfix version 2.2, the  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent will terminate with a fatal error.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases, nis:mail.aliases<br>
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>allow_mail_to_commands (default: alias, forward)</h1> Restrict  <b>local</b>(8) mail delivery to external commands.  The default is to disallow delivery to "|command" in :include:  files (see  <b>aliases</b>(5) for the text that defines this terminology).<p>
Specify zero or more of: <b>alias</b>, <b>forward</b> or <b>include</b>, in order to allow commands in  <b>aliases</b>(5), .forward files or in :include:  files, respectively.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
allow_mail_to_commands = alias,forward,include<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>allow_mail_to_files (default: alias, forward)</h1> Restrict  <b>local</b>(8) mail delivery to external files. The default is to disallow "/file/name" destinations in :include:  files (see  <b>aliases</b>(5) for the text that defines this terminology).<p>
Specify zero or more of: <b>alias</b>, <b>forward</b> or <b>include</b>, in order to allow "/file/name" destinations in  <b>aliases</b>(5), .forward files and in :include:  files, respectively.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
allow_mail_to_files = alias,forward,include<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>allow_min_user (default: no)</h1> Allow a sender or recipient address to have `-' as the first character.  By default, this is not allowed, to avoid accidents with software that passes email addresses via the command line. Such software would not be able to distinguish a malicious address from a bona fide command-line option. Although this can be prevented by inserting a "--" option terminator into the command line, this is difficult to enforce consistently and globally.<p>
As of Postfix version 2.5, this feature is implemented by  <b>trivial-rewrite</b>(8).  With earlier versions this feature was implemented by  <b>qmgr</b>(8) and was limited to recipient addresses only.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>allow_percent_hack (default: yes)</h1> Enable the rewriting of the form "user%domain" to "user@domain". This is enabled by default.<p>
Note: as of Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of the following conditions is true:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received with the Postfix <b>sendmail</b>(1) command,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter specifies a non-empty value.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
allow_percent_hack = no<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>allow_untrusted_routing (default: no)</h1> Forward mail with sender-specified routing (user[@%!]remote[@%!]site) from untrusted clients to destinations matching $relay_domains.<p>
By default, this feature is turned off.  This closes a nasty open relay loophole where a backup MX host can be tricked into forwarding junk mail to a primary MX host which then spams it out to the world.<p>
This parameter also controls if non-local addresses with sender-specified routing can match Postfix access tables. By default, such addresses cannot match Postfix access tables, because the address is ambiguous.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>alternate_config_directories (default: empty)</h1> A list of non-default Postfix configuration directories that may be specified with "-c config_directory" on the command line, or via the MAIL_CONFIG environment parameter.<p>
This list must be specified in the default Postfix configuration directory, and is used by set-gid Postfix commands such as  <b>postqueue</b>(1) and  <b>postdrop</b>(1).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>always_add_missing_headers (default: no)</h1> Always add (Resent-) From:, To:, Date: or Message-ID: headers when not present.  Postfix 2.6 and later add these headers only when clients match the local_header_rewrite_clients parameter setting.  Earlier Postfix versions always add these headers; this may break DKIM signatures that cover non-existent headers.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>always_bcc (default: empty)</h1> Optional address that receives a "blind carbon copy" of each message that is received by the Postfix mail system.<p>
Note: with Postfix 2.3 and later the BCC address is added as if it was specified with NOTIFY=NONE. The sender will not be notified when the BCC address is undeliverable, as long as all down-stream software implements RFC 3461.<p>
Note: with Postfix 2.2 and earlier the sender will be notified when the BCC address is undeliverable.<p>
Note: automatic BCC recipients are produced only for new mail. To avoid mailer loops, automatic BCC recipients are not generated after Postfix forwards mail internally, or after Postfix generates mail itself.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>anvil_rate_time_unit (default: 60s)</h1> The time unit over which client connection rates and other rates are calculated.<p>
This feature is implemented by the <b>anvil</b>(8) service which is available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.<p>
The default interval is relatively short. Because of the high frequency of updates, the  <b>anvil</b>(8) server uses volatile memory only. Thus, information is lost whenever the process terminates.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>anvil_status_update_time (default: 600s)</h1> How frequently the  <b>anvil</b>(8) connection and rate limiting server logs peak usage information.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>append_at_myorigin (default: yes)</h1> With locally submitted mail, append the string "@$myorigin" to mail addresses without domain information. With remotely submitted mail, append the string "@$remote_header_rewrite_domain" instead.<p>
Note 1: this feature is enabled by default and must not be turned off. Postfix does not support domain-less addresses.<p>
Note 2: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of the following conditions is true:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received with the Postfix <b>sendmail</b>(1) command,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter specifies a non-empty value.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>append_dot_mydomain (default: yes)</h1> With locally submitted mail, append the string ".$mydomain" to addresses that have no ".domain" information. With remotely submitted mail, append the string ".$remote_header_rewrite_domain" instead.<p>
Note 1: this feature is enabled by default. If disabled, users will not be able to send mail to "user@partialdomainname" but will have to specify full domain names instead.<p>
Note 2: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of the following conditions is true:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received with the Postfix <b>sendmail</b>(1) command,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter specifies a non-empty value.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>application_event_drain_time (default: 100s)</h1> How long the  <b>postkick</b>(1) command waits for a request to enter the Postfix daemon process input buffer before giving up.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>authorized_flush_users (default: static:anyone)</h1> List of users who are authorized to flush the queue.<p>
By default, all users are allowed to flush the queue.  Access is always granted if the invoking user is the super-user or the $mail_owner user.  Otherwise, the real UID of the process is looked up in the system password file, and access is granted only if the corresponding login name is on the access list.  The username "unknown" is used for processes whose real UID is not found in the password file.<p>
Specify a list of user names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The list is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match. A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name matches a lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a name from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>authorized_mailq_users (default: static:anyone)</h1> List of users who are authorized to view the queue.<p>
By default, all users are allowed to view the queue.  Access is always granted if the invoking user is the super-user or the $mail_owner user.  Otherwise, the real UID of the process is looked up in the system password file, and access is granted only if the corresponding login name is on the access list.  The username "unknown" is used for processes whose real UID is not found in the password file.<p>
Specify a list of user names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The list is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match. A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name matches a lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a user name from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>authorized_submit_users (default: static:anyone)</h1> List of users who are authorized to submit mail with the  <b>sendmail</b>(1) command (and with the privileged  <b>postdrop</b>(1) helper command).<p>
By default, all users are allowed to submit mail.  Otherwise, the real UID of the process is looked up in the system password file, and access is granted only if the corresponding login name is on the access list.  The username "unknown" is used for processes whose real UID is not found in the password file. To deny mail submission access to all users specify an empty list.<p>
Specify a list of user names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The list is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match. A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name matches a lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a user name from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
authorized_submit_users = !www, static:all<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>authorized_verp_clients (default: $mynetworks)</h1> What remote SMTP clients are allowed to specify the XVERP command. This command requests that mail be delivered one recipient at a time with a per recipient return address.<p>
By default, only trusted clients are allowed to specify XVERP.<p>
This parameter was introduced with Postfix version 1.1.  Postfix version 2.1 renamed this parameter to smtpd_authorized_verp_clients and changed the default to none.<p>
Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies the number of bits in the network part of a host address. You can also specify hostnames or .domain names (the initial dot causes the domain to match any name below it),  "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns.  A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.<p>
Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in the authorized_verp_clients value, and in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":" character, and would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>backwards_bounce_logfile_compatibility (default: yes)</h1> Produce additional  <b>bounce</b>(8) logfile records that can be read by Postfix versions before 2.0. The current and more extensible "name = value" format is needed in order to implement more sophisticated functionality.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>berkeley_db_create_buffer_size (default: 16777216)</h1> The per-table I/O buffer size for programs that create Berkeley DB hash or btree tables.  Specify a byte count.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>berkeley_db_read_buffer_size (default: 131072)</h1> The per-table I/O buffer size for programs that read Berkeley DB hash or btree tables.  Specify a byte count.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>best_mx_transport (default: empty)</h1> Where the Postfix SMTP client should deliver mail when it detects a "mail loops back to myself" error condition. This happens when the local MTA is the best SMTP mail exchanger for a destination not listed in $mydestination, $inet_interfaces, $proxy_interfaces, $virtual_alias_domains, or $virtual_mailbox_domains.  By default, the Postfix SMTP client returns such mail as undeliverable.<p>
Specify, for example, "best_mx_transport = local" to pass the mail from the Postfix SMTP client to the  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent. You can specify any message delivery "transport" or "transport:nexthop" that is defined in the master.cf file. See the  <b>transport</b>(5) manual page for the syntax and meaning of "transport" or "transport:nexthop".<p>
However, this feature is expensive because it ties up a Postfix SMTP client process while the  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent is doing its work. It is more efficient (for Postfix) to list all hosted domains in a table or database.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>biff (default: yes)</h1> Whether or not to use the local biff service.  This service sends "new mail" notifications to users who have requested new mail notification with the UNIX command "biff y".<p>
For compatibility reasons this feature is on by default.  On systems with lots of interactive users, the biff service can be a performance drain.  Specify "biff = no" in main.cf to disable.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>body_checks (default: empty)</h1> Optional lookup tables for content inspection as specified in the  <b>body_checks</b>(5) manual page.<p>
Note: with Postfix versions before 2.0, these rules inspect all content after the primary message headers.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>body_checks_size_limit (default: 51200)</h1> How much text in a message body segment (or attachment, if you prefer to use that term) is subjected to body_checks inspection. The amount of text is limited to avoid scanning huge attachments.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>bounce_notice_recipient (default: postmaster)</h1> The recipient of postmaster notifications with the message headers of mail that Postfix did not deliver and of SMTP conversation transcripts of mail that Postfix did not receive.  This feature is enabled with the notify_classes parameter.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>bounce_queue_lifetime (default: 5d)</h1> Consider a bounce message as undeliverable, when delivery fails with a temporary error, and the time in the queue has reached the bounce_queue_lifetime limit.  By default, this limit is the same as for regular mail.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is d (days).<p>
Specify 0 when mail delivery should be tried only once.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>bounce_service_name (default: bounce)</h1> The name of the  <b>bounce</b>(8) service. This service maintains a record of failed delivery attempts and generates non-delivery notifications.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>bounce_size_limit (default: 50000)</h1> The maximal amount of original message text that is sent in a non-delivery notification. Specify a byte count.  A message is returned as either message/rfc822 (the complete original) or as text/rfc822-headers (the headers only).  With Postfix version 2.4 and earlier, a message is always returned as message/rfc822 and is truncated when it exceeds the size limit.<p>

</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>bounce_template_file (default: empty)</h1> Pathname of a configuration file with bounce message templates. These override the built-in templates of delivery status notification (DSN) messages for undeliverable mail, for delayed mail, successful delivery, or delivery verification. The  <b>bounce</b>(5) manual page describes how to edit and test template files.<p>
Template message body text may contain $name references to Postfix configuration parameters. The result of $name expansion can be previewed with " <b>postconf -b </b><i>file_name</i>" before the file is placed into the Postfix configuration directory.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>broken_sasl_auth_clients (default: no)</h1> Enable inter-operability with remote SMTP clients that implement an obsolete version of the AUTH command (RFC 4954). Examples of such clients are MicroSoft Outlook Express version 4 and MicroSoft Exchange version 5.0.<p>
Specify "broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes" to have Postfix advertise AUTH support in a non-standard way.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>canonical_classes (default: envelope_sender, envelope_recipient, header_sender, header_recipient)</h1> What addresses are subject to canonical_maps address mapping. By default, canonical_maps address mapping is applied to envelope sender and recipient addresses, and to header sender and header recipient addresses.<p>
Specify one or more of: envelope_sender, envelope_recipient, header_sender, header_recipient<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>canonical_maps (default: empty)</h1> Optional address mapping lookup tables for message headers and envelopes. The mapping is applied to both sender and recipient addresses, in both envelopes and in headers, as controlled with the canonical_classes parameter. This is typically used to clean up dirty addresses from legacy mail systems, or to replace login names by Firstname.Lastname.  The table format and lookups are documented in  <b>canonical</b>(5). For an overview of Postfix address manipulations see the ADDRESS_REWRITING_README document.<p>
If you use this feature, run "<b>postmap /etc/postfix/canonical</b>" to build the necessary DBM or DB file after every change. The changes will become visible after a minute or so.  Use " <b>postfix reload</b>" to eliminate the delay.<p>
Note: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address mapping happens only when message header address rewriting is enabled:<dl>

The cache TTL is already bounded by $max_idle.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>content_filter (default: empty)</h1> After the message is queued, send the entire message to the specified  <i>transport:destination</i>.

<h1>daemon_table_open_error_is_fatal (default: no)</h1> How a Postfix daemon process handles errors while opening lookup tables: gradual degradation or immediate termination.<dl>
<dt>
<b> no </b> (default)</dt>
<dd>
Gradual degradation: a daemon process logs a message of type "error" and continues execution with reduced functionality. Features that do not depend on the unavailable table will work normally, while features that depend on the table will result in a type "warning" message.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b> yes </b> (historical behavior)</dt>

Immediate termination: a daemon process logs a type "fatal" message and terminates immediately.  This option reduces the number of possible code paths through Postfix, and may therefore be slightly more secure than the default.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>

For the sake of sanity, the number of type "error" messages is limited to 13 over the lifetime of a daemon process.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>daemon_timeout (default: 18000s)</h1> How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>debug_peer_level (default: 2)</h1> The increment in verbose logging level when a remote client or server matches a pattern in the debug_peer_list parameter.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>debug_peer_list (default: empty)</h1> Optional list of remote client or server hostname or network address patterns that cause the verbose logging level to increase by the amount specified in $debug_peer_level.<p>
Specify domain names, network/netmask patterns, "/file/name" patterns or "type:table" lookup tables. The right-hand side result from "type:table" lookups is ignored.<p>
Pattern matching of domain names is controlled by the parent_domain_matches_subdomains parameter.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
debug_peer_list = 127.0.0.1<br>
debug_peer_list = example.com<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>debugger_command (default: empty)</h1> The external command to execute when a Postfix daemon program is invoked with the -D option.<p>
Use "command .. &amp; sleep 5" so that the debugger can attach before the process marches on. If you use an X-based debugger, be sure to set up your XAUTHORITY environment variable before starting Postfix.<p>
Note: the command is subject to $name expansion, before it is passed to the default command interpreter. Specify "$$" to produce a single "$" character.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
debugger_command =<br>
    PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin<br>
    ddd $daemon_directory/$process_name $process_id &amp; sleep 5<br>

<div class="section">
<h1>default_database_type (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> The default database type for use in  <b>newaliases</b>(1), <b>postalias</b>(1) and  <b>postmap</b>(1) commands. On many UNIX systems the default type is either  <b>dbm</b> or <b>hash</b>. The default setting is frozen when the Postfix system is built.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
default_database_type = hash<br>
default_database_type = dbm<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>default_delivery_slot_cost (default: 5)</h1> How often the Postfix queue manager's scheduler is allowed to preempt delivery of one message with another.<p>
Each transport maintains a so-called "available delivery slot counter" for each message. One message can be preempted by another one when the other message can be delivered using no more delivery slots (i.e., invocations of delivery agents) than the current message counter has accumulated (or will eventually accumulate - see about slot loans below). This parameter controls how often is the counter incremented - it happens after each default_delivery_slot_cost recipients have been delivered.<p>
The cost of 0 is used to disable the preempting scheduling completely. The minimum value the scheduling algorithm can use is 2 - use it if you want to maximize the message throughput rate. Although there is no maximum, it doesn't make much sense to use values above say 50.<p>
The only reason why the value of 2 is not the default is the way this parameter affects the delivery of mailing-list mail. In the worst case, their delivery can take somewhere between (cost+1/cost) and (cost/cost-1) times more than if the preemptive scheduler was disabled. The default value of 5 turns out to provide reasonable message response times while making sure the mailing-list deliveries are not extended by more than 20-25 percent even in the worst case.<p>
Use <i>transport</i>_delivery_slot_cost to specify a transport-specific override, where  <i>transport</i> is the master.cf name of the message delivery transport.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
default_delivery_slot_cost = 0<br>
default_delivery_slot_cost = 2<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>default_delivery_slot_discount (default: 50)</h1> The default value for transport-specific _delivery_slot_discount settings.<p>
This parameter speeds up the moment when a message preemption can happen. Instead of waiting until the full amount of delivery slots required is available, the preemption can happen when transport_delivery_slot_discount percent of the required amount plus transport_delivery_slot_loan still remains to be accumulated. Note that the full amount will still have to be accumulated before another preemption can take place later.<p>
Use <i>transport</i>_delivery_slot_discount to specify a transport-specific override, where  <i>transport</i> is the master.cf name of the message delivery transport.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>default_delivery_slot_loan (default: 3)</h1> The default value for transport-specific _delivery_slot_loan settings.<p>
This parameter speeds up the moment when a message preemption can happen. Instead of waiting until the full amount of delivery slots required is available, the preemption can happen when transport_delivery_slot_discount percent of the required amount plus transport_delivery_slot_loan still remains to be accumulated. Note that the full amount will still have to be accumulated before another preemption can take place later.<p>
Use <i>transport</i>_delivery_slot_loan to specify a transport-specific override, where  <i>transport</i> is the master.cf name of the message delivery transport.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>default_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit (default: 1)</h1> How many pseudo-cohorts must suffer connection or handshake failure before a specific destination is considered unavailable (and further delivery is suspended). Specify zero to disable this feature. A destination's pseudo-cohort failure count is reset each time a delivery completes without connection or handshake failure for that specific destination.<p>
A pseudo-cohort is the number of deliveries equal to a destination's delivery concurrency.<p>
Use <i>transport</i>_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit to specify a transport-specific override, where  <i>transport</i> is the master.cf name of the message delivery transport.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.5. The default setting is compatible with earlier Postfix versions.</div>
<div class="section">

This is the default limit for delivery via the  <b>lmtp</b>(8),  <b>pipe</b>(8), <b>smtp</b>(8) and <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agents. With per-destination recipient limit &gt; 1, a destination is a domain, otherwise it is a recipient.<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>default_destination_concurrency_negative_feedback (default: 1)</h1> The per-destination amount of delivery concurrency negative feedback, after a delivery completes with a connection or handshake failure. Feedback values are in the range 0..1 inclusive. With negative feedback, concurrency is decremented at the beginning of a sequence of length 1/feedback. This is unlike positive feedback, where concurrency is incremented at the end of a sequence of length 1/feedback.<p>
As of Postfix version 2.5, negative feedback cannot reduce delivery concurrency to zero.  Instead, a destination is marked dead (further delivery suspended) after the failed pseudo-cohort count reaches $default_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit (or $ <i>transport</i>_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit). To make the scheduler completely immune to connection or handshake failures, specify a zero feedback value and a zero failed pseudo-cohort limit.<p>

New queue files are created with names such as 3Pt2mN2VXxznjll. These are encoded in a 52-character alphabet that contains digits (0-9), upper-case letters (B-Z) and lower-case letters (b-z). For safety reasons the vowels (AEIOUaeiou) are excluded from the alphabet. The name format is: 6 or more characters for the time in seconds, 4 characters for the time in microseconds, the 'z'; the remainder is the file inode number encoded in the first 51 characters of the 52-character alphabet.</dd>

Existing long queue file names are renamed to the short form (while running "postfix reload" or "postsuper").</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
New queue files are created with names such as C3CD21F3E90 from a hexadecimal alphabet that contains digits (0-9) and upper-case letters (A-F). The name format is: 5 characters for the time in microseconds; the remainder is the file inode number.</dd>

<p>
Repeat the postsuper command until it reports no more queue file name changes.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>enable_original_recipient (default: yes)</h1> Enable support for the X-Original-To message header. This header is needed for multi-recipient mailboxes.<p>
When this parameter is set to yes, the <b>cleanup</b>(8) daemon performs duplicate elimination on distinct pairs of (original recipient, rewritten recipient), and generates non-empty original recipient queue file records.<p>
When this parameter is set to no, the <b>cleanup</b>(8) daemon performs duplicate elimination on the rewritten recipient address only, and generates empty original recipient queue file records.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later. With Postfix version 2.0, support for the X-Original-To message header is always turned on. Postfix versions before 2.0 have no support for the X-Original-To message header.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>fallback_relay (default: empty)</h1> Optional list of relay hosts for SMTP destinations that can't be found or that are unreachable. With Postfix 2.3 this parameter is renamed to smtp_fallback_relay.<p>
By default, mail is returned to the sender when a destination is not found, and delivery is deferred when a destination is unreachable.<p>
The fallback relays must be SMTP destinations. Specify a domain, host, host:port, [host]:port, [address] or [address]:port; the form [host] turns off MX lookups.  If you specify multiple SMTP destinations, Postfix will try them in the specified order.<p>
Note: before Postfix 2.2, do not use the fallback_relay feature when relaying mail for a backup or primary MX domain. Mail would loop between the Postfix MX host and the fallback_relay host when the final destination is unavailable.<dl>

<h1>frozen_delivered_to (default: yes)</h1> Update the  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent's idea of the Delivered-To: address (see prepend_delivered_header) only once, at the start of a delivery attempt; do not update the Delivered-To: address while expanding aliases or .forward files.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later. With older Postfix releases, the behavior is as if this parameter is set to "no". The old setting can be expensive with deeply nested aliases or .forward files. When an alias or .forward file changes the Delivered-To: address, it ties up one queue file and one cleanup process instance while mail is being forwarded.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>hash_queue_depth (default: 1)</h1> The number of subdirectory levels for queue directories listed with the hash_queue_names parameter. Queue hashing is implemented by creating one or more levels of directories with one-character names. Originally, these directory names were equal to the first characters of the queue file name, with the hexadecimal representation of the file creation time in microseconds.<p>
With long queue file names, queue hashing produces the same results as with short names. The file creation time in microseconds is converted into hexadecimal form before the result is used for queue hashing.  The base 16 encoding gives finer control over the number of subdirectories than is possible with the base 52 encoding of long queue file names.<p>
After changing the hash_queue_names or hash_queue_depth parameter, execute the command " <b>postfix reload</b>".</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>hash_queue_names (default: deferred, defer)</h1> The names of queue directories that are split across multiple subdirectory levels.<p>
Before Postfix version 2.2, the default list of hashed queues was significantly larger. Claims about improvements in file system technology suggest that hashing of the incoming and active queues is no longer needed. Fewer hashed directories speed up the time needed to restart Postfix.<p>
After changing the hash_queue_names or hash_queue_depth parameter, execute the command " <b>postfix reload</b>".</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>header_address_token_limit (default: 10240)</h1> The maximal number of address tokens are allowed in an address message header. Information that exceeds the limit is discarded. The limit is enforced by the  <b>cleanup</b>(8) server.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>ignore_mx_lookup_error (default: no)</h1> Ignore DNS MX lookups that produce no response.  By default, the Postfix SMTP client defers delivery and tries again after some delay.  This behavior is required by the SMTP standard.<p>
Specify "ignore_mx_lookup_error = yes" to force a DNS A record lookup instead. This violates the SMTP standard and can result in mis-delivery of mail.</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
<h1>in_flow_delay (default: 1s)</h1> Time to pause before accepting a new message, when the message arrival rate exceeds the message delivery rate. This feature is turned on by default (it's disabled on SCO UNIX due to an SCO bug).<p>
With the default 100 Postfix SMTP server process limit, "in_flow_delay = 1s" limits the mail inflow to 100 messages per second above the number of messages delivered per second.<p>
Specify 0 to disable the feature. Valid delays are 0..10.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>inet_interfaces (default: all)</h1> The network interface addresses that this mail system receives mail on. Specify "all" to receive mail on all network interfaces (default), and "loopback-only" to receive mail on loopback network interfaces only (Postfix version 2.2 and later).  The parameter also controls delivery of mail to user@[ip.address].<p>
Note 1: you need to stop and start Postfix when this parameter changes.<p>
Note 2: address information may be enclosed inside [], but this form is not required here.<p>
When inet_interfaces specifies just one IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that is not a loopback address, the Postfix SMTP client will use this address as the IP source address for outbound mail. Support for IPv6 is available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.<p>
On a multi-homed firewall with separate Postfix instances listening on the "inside" and "outside" interfaces, this can prevent each instance from being able to reach remote SMTP servers on the "other side" of the firewall. Setting smtp_bind_address to 0.0.0.0 avoids the potential problem for IPv4, and setting smtp_bind_address6 to :: solves the problem for IPv6.<p>
A better solution for multi-homed firewalls is to leave inet_interfaces at the default value and instead use explicit IP addresses in the master.cf SMTP server definitions.  This preserves the Postfix SMTP client's loop detection, by ensuring that each side of the firewall knows that the other IP address is still the same host. Setting $inet_interfaces to a single IPv4 and/or IPV6 address is primarily useful with virtual hosting of domains on secondary IP addresses, when each IP address serves a different domain (and has a different $myhostname setting).<p>
See also the proxy_interfaces parameter, for network addresses that are forwarded to Postfix by way of a proxy or address translator.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
inet_interfaces = all (DEFAULT)<br>
inet_interfaces = loopback-only (Postfix version 2.2 and later)<br>
inet_interfaces = 127.0.0.1<br>
inet_interfaces = 127.0.0.1, [::1] (Postfix version 2.2 and later)<br>
inet_interfaces = 192.168.1.2, 127.0.0.1<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>inet_protocols (default: all)</h1> The Internet protocols Postfix will attempt to use when making or accepting connections. Specify one or more of "ipv4" or "ipv6", separated by whitespace or commas. The form "all" is equivalent to "ipv4, ipv6" or "ipv4", depending on whether the operating system implements IPv6.<p>
With Postfix 2.8 and earlier the default is "ipv4". For backwards compatibility with these releases, the Postfix 2.9 and later upgrade procedure appends an explicit "inet_protocols = ipv4" setting to main.cf when no explicit setting is present. This compatibility workaround will be phased out as IPv6 deployment becomes more common.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.<p>
Note: you MUST stop and start Postfix after changing this parameter.<p>
On systems that pre-date IPV6_V6ONLY support (RFC 3493), an IPv6 server will also accept IPv4 connections, even when IPv4 is turned off with the inet_protocols parameter.  On systems with IPV6_V6ONLY support, Postfix will use separate server sockets for IPv6 and IPv4, and each will accept only connections for the corresponding protocol.<p>
When IPv4 support is enabled via the inet_protocols parameter, Postfix will look up DNS type A records, and will convert IPv4-in-IPv6 client IP addresses (::ffff:1.2.3.4) to their original IPv4 form (1.2.3.4).  The latter is needed on hosts that pre-date IPV6_V6ONLY support (RFC 3493).<p>
When IPv6 support is enabled via the inet_protocols parameter, Postfix will do DNS type AAAA record lookups.<p>
When both IPv4 and IPv6 support are enabled, the Postfix SMTP client will choose the protocol as specified with the smtp_address_preference parameter. Postfix versions before 2.8 attempt to connect via IPv6 before attempting to use IPv4.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
inet_protocols = ipv4<br>
inet_protocols = all (DEFAULT)<br>
inet_protocols = ipv6<br>
inet_protocols = ipv4, ipv6<br>

<div class="section">
<h1>initial_destination_concurrency (default: 5)</h1> The initial per-destination concurrency level for parallel delivery to the same destination. With per-destination recipient limit &gt; 1, a destination is a domain, otherwise it is a recipient.<p>
Use <i>transport</i>_initial_destination_concurrency to specify a transport-specific override, where  <i>transport</i> is the master.cf name of the message delivery transport (Postfix 2.5 and later).<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>internal_mail_filter_classes (default: empty)</h1> What categories of Postfix-generated mail are subject to before-queue content inspection by non_smtpd_milters, header_checks and body_checks.  Specify zero or more of the following, separated by whitespace or comma.<dl>

<h1>local_recipient_maps (default: proxy:unix:passwd.byname $alias_maps)</h1> Lookup tables with all names or addresses of local recipients: a recipient address is local when its domain matches $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.  Specify @domain as a wild-card for domains that do not have a valid recipient list. Technically, tables listed with $local_recipient_maps are used as lists: Postfix needs to know only if a lookup string is found or not, but it does not use the result from table lookup.<p>
If this parameter is non-empty (the default), then the Postfix SMTP server will reject mail for unknown local users.<p>
To turn off local recipient checking in the Postfix SMTP server, specify "local_recipient_maps =" (i.e. empty).<p>
The default setting assumes that you use the default Postfix local delivery agent for local delivery. You need to update the local_recipient_maps setting if:<dl>

Details are described in the LOCAL_RECIPIENT_README file.<p>
Beware: if the Postfix SMTP server runs chrooted, you need to access the passwd file via the  <b>proxymap</b>(8) service, in order to overcome chroot access restrictions. The alternative, maintaining a copy of the system password file in the chroot jail is not practical.<p>
Examples:<p>

<h1>local_transport (default: local:$myhostname)</h1> The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for final delivery to domains listed with mydestination, and for [ipaddress] destinations that match $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces. This information can be overruled with the  <b>transport</b>(5) table.<p>
By default, local mail is delivered to the transport called "local", which is just the name of a service that is defined the master.cf file.<p>
Specify a string of the form <i>transport:nexthop</i>, where <i>transport</i> is the name of a mail delivery transport defined in master.cf. The  <i>:nexthop</i> destination is optional; its syntax is documented in the manual page of the corresponding delivery agent.<p>
Beware: if you override the default local delivery agent then you need to review the LOCAL_RECIPIENT_README document, otherwise the SMTP server may reject mail for local recipients.</div>

Instead of $name you can also specify ${name} or $(name).<p>
Note: luser_relay works only for the Postfix <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent.<p>
Note: if you use this feature for accounts not in the UNIX password file, then you must specify "local_recipient_maps =" (i.e. empty) in the main.cf file, otherwise the Postfix SMTP server will reject mail for non-UNIX accounts with "User unknown in local recipient table".<p>
Examples:<p>

luser_relay = $user@other.host<br>
luser_relay = $local@other.host<br>
luser_relay = admin+$local<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mail_name (default: Postfix)</h1> The mail system name that is displayed in Received: headers, in the SMTP greeting banner, and in bounced mail.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mail_owner (default: postfix)</h1> The UNIX system account that owns the Postfix queue and most Postfix daemon processes.  Specify the name of an unprivileged user account that does not share a user or group ID with other accounts, and that owns no other files or processes on the system.  In particular, don't specify nobody or daemon.  PLEASE USE A DEDICATED USER ID AND GROUP ID.<p>
When this parameter value is changed you need to re-run "<b>postfix</b>  <b>set-permissions</b>" (with Postfix version 2.0 and earlier: " <b>/etc/postfix/post-install set-permissions</b>".</div>

Note: maildir delivery is done with the privileges of the recipient. If you use the mail_spool_directory setting for maildir style delivery, then you must create the top-level maildir directory in advance. Postfix will not create it.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
mail_spool_directory = /var/mail<br>
mail_spool_directory = /var/spool/mail<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mail_version (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> The version of the mail system. Stable releases are named  <i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>patchlevel</i>. Experimental releases also include the release date. The version string can be used in, for example, the SMTP greeting banner.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mailbox_command (default: empty)</h1> Optional external command that the  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent should use for mailbox delivery.  The command is run with the user ID and the primary group ID privileges of the recipient.  Exception: command delivery for root executes with $default_privs privileges. This is not a problem, because 1) mail for root should always be aliased to a real user and 2) don't log in as root, use "su" instead.<p>

Unlike other Postfix configuration parameters, the mailbox_command parameter is not subjected to $name substitutions. This is to make it easier to specify shell syntax (see example below).<p>
If you can, avoid shell meta characters because they will force Postfix to run an expensive shell process. If you're delivering via Procmail then running a shell won't make a noticeable difference in the total cost.<p>
Note: if you use the mailbox_command feature to deliver mail system-wide, you must set up an alias that forwards mail for root to a real user.<p>
The precedence of <b>local</b>(8) delivery features from high to low is: aliases, .forward files, mailbox_transport_maps, mailbox_transport, mailbox_command_maps, mailbox_command, home_mailbox, mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
mailbox_command = /some/where/procmail<br>
mailbox_command = /some/where/procmail -a "$EXTENSION"<br>
mailbox_command = /some/where/maildrop -d "$USER"<br>
        -f "$SENDER" "$EXTENSION"<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mailbox_command_maps (default: empty)</h1> Optional lookup tables with per-recipient external commands to use for  <b>local</b>(8) mailbox delivery.  Behavior is as with mailbox_command.<p>
The precedence of <b>local</b>(8) delivery features from high to low is: aliases, .forward files, mailbox_transport_maps, mailbox_transport, mailbox_command_maps, mailbox_command, home_mailbox, mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mailbox_delivery_lock (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> How to lock a UNIX-style  <b>local</b>(8) mailbox before attempting delivery. For a list of available file locking methods, use the " <b>postconf</b>  <b>-l</b>" command.<p>
This setting is ignored with <b>maildir</b> style delivery, because such deliveries are safe without explicit locks.<p>
Note: The <b>dotlock</b> method requires that the recipient UID or GID has write access to the parent directory of the mailbox file.<p>
Note: the default setting of this parameter is system dependent.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mailbox_size_limit (default: 51200000)</h1> The maximal size of any  <b>local</b>(8) individual mailbox or maildir file, or zero (no limit).  In fact, this limits the size of any file that is written to upon local delivery, including files written by external commands that are executed by the  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent.<p>
This limit must not be smaller than the message size limit.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mailbox_transport (default: empty)</h1> Optional message delivery transport that the  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent should use for mailbox delivery to all local recipients, whether or not they are found in the UNIX passwd database.<p>
The precedence of <b>local</b>(8) delivery features from high to low is: aliases, .forward files, mailbox_transport_maps, mailbox_transport, mailbox_command_maps, mailbox_command, home_mailbox, mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mailbox_transport_maps (default: empty)</h1> Optional lookup tables with per-recipient message delivery transports to use for  <b>local</b>(8) mailbox delivery, whether or not the recipients are found in the UNIX passwd database.<p>
The precedence of <b>local</b>(8) delivery features from high to low is: aliases, .forward files, mailbox_transport_maps, mailbox_transport, mailbox_command_maps, mailbox_command, home_mailbox, mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.<p>
For safety reasons, this feature does not allow $number substitutions in regular expression maps.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mailq_path (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> Sendmail compatibility feature that specifies where the Postfix  <b>mailq</b>(1) command is installed. This command can be used to list the Postfix mail queue.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>manpage_directory (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> Where the Postfix manual pages are installed.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>maps_rbl_domains (default: empty)</h1> Obsolete feature: use the reject_rbl_client feature instead.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>maps_rbl_reject_code (default: 554)</h1> The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a remote SMTP client request is blocked by the reject_rbl_client, reject_rhsbl_client, reject_rhsbl_reverse_client, reject_rhsbl_sender or reject_rhsbl_recipient restriction.<p>
Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>masquerade_classes (default: envelope_sender, header_sender, header_recipient)</h1> What addresses are subject to address masquerading.<p>
By default, address masquerading is limited to envelope sender addresses, and to header sender and header recipient addresses. This allows you to use address masquerading on a mail gateway while still being able to forward mail to users on individual machines.<p>
Specify zero or more of: envelope_sender, envelope_recipient, header_sender, header_recipient</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>masquerade_domains (default: empty)</h1> Optional list of domains whose subdomain structure will be stripped off in email addresses.<p>
The list is processed left to right, and processing stops at the first match.  Thus,<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
masquerade_domains = foo.example.com example.com<br>
<br>
<p>
strips "user@any.thing.foo.example.com" to "user@foo.example.com", but strips "user@any.thing.else.example.com" to "user@example.com".<p>
A domain name prefixed with ! means do not masquerade this domain or its subdomains. Thus,<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
masquerade_domains = !foo.example.com example.com<br>
<br>
<p>
does not change "user@any.thing.foo.example.com" or "user@foo.example.com", but strips "user@any.thing.else.example.com" to "user@example.com".<p>
Note: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address masquerading happens only when message header address rewriting is enabled:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received with the Postfix <b>sendmail</b>(1) command,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter specifies a non-empty value.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
masquerade_domains = $mydomain<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>masquerade_exceptions (default: empty)</h1> Optional list of user names that are not subjected to address masquerading, even when their address matches $masquerade_domains.<p>
By default, address masquerading makes no exceptions.<p>
Specify a list of user names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The list is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match. A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name matches a lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a name from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
masquerade_exceptions = root, mailer-daemon<br>
masquerade_exceptions = root<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>master_service_disable (default: empty)</h1> Selectively disable  <b>master</b>(8) listener ports by service type or by service name and type.  Specify a list of service types ("inet", "unix", "fifo", or "pass") or "name/type" tuples, where "name" is the first field of a master.cf entry and "type" is a service type. As with other Postfix matchlists, a search stops at the first match.  Specify "!pattern" to exclude a service from the list. By default, all  <b>master</b>(8) listener ports are enabled.<p>
Note: this feature does not support "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, nor does it support wildcards such as "*" or "all". This is intentional.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
# With Postfix 2.6..2.10 use '.' instead of '/'.<br>
# Turn on all <b>master</b>(8) listener ports (the default).<br>
master_service_disable =<br>
# Turn off only the main SMTP listener port.<br>
master_service_disable = smtp/inet<br>
# Turn off all TCP/IP listener ports.<br>
master_service_disable = inet<br>
# Turn off all TCP/IP listener ports except "foo".<br>
master_service_disable = !foo/inet, inet<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>max_idle (default: 100s)</h1> The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process waits for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.  This parameter is ignored by the Postfix queue manager and by other long-lived Postfix daemon processes.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>max_use (default: 100)</h1> The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon process will service before terminating voluntarily.  This parameter is ignored by the Postfix queue manager and by other long-lived Postfix daemon processes.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>maximal_backoff_time (default: 4000s)</h1> The maximal time between attempts to deliver a deferred message.<p>
This parameter should be set to a value greater than or equal to $minimal_backoff_time. See also $queue_run_delay.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>maximal_queue_lifetime (default: 5d)</h1> Consider a message as undeliverable, when delivery fails with a temporary error, and the time in the queue has reached the maximal_queue_lifetime limit.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is d (days).<p>
Specify 0 when mail delivery should be tried only once.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>message_reject_characters (default: empty)</h1> The set of characters that Postfix will reject in message content.  The usual C-like escape sequences are recognized: &#92;a &#92;b &#92;f &#92;n &#92;r &#92;t &#92;v &#92; <i>ddd</i> (up to three octal digits) and &#92;&#92;.<p>
Note 1: this feature does not recognize text that requires MIME decoding. It inspects raw message content, just like header_checks and body_checks.<p>
Note 2: this feature is disabled with "receive_override_options = no_header_body_checks".<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
message_reject_characters = &#92;0<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>message_size_limit (default: 10240000)</h1> The maximal size in bytes of a message, including envelope information.<p>
Note: be careful when making changes.  Excessively small values will result in the loss of non-delivery notifications, when a bounce message size exceeds the local or remote MTA's message size limit.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>message_strip_characters (default: empty)</h1> The set of characters that Postfix will remove from message content.  The usual C-like escape sequences are recognized: &#92;a &#92;b &#92;f &#92;n &#92;r &#92;t &#92;v &#92; <i>ddd</i> (up to three octal digits) and &#92;&#92;.<p>

This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>minimal_backoff_time (default: 300s)</h1> The minimal time between attempts to deliver a deferred message; prior to Postfix 2.4 the default value was 1000s.<p>
This parameter also limits the time an unreachable destination is kept in the short-term, in-memory, destination status cache.<p>
This parameter should be set greater than or equal to $queue_run_delay. See also $maximal_backoff_time.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>multi_instance_directories (default: empty)</h1> An optional list of non-default Postfix configuration directories; these directories belong to additional Postfix instances that share the Postfix executable files and documentation with the default Postfix instance, and that are started, stopped, etc., together with the default Postfix instance.  Specify a list of pathnames separated by comma or whitespace.<p>
When $multi_instance_directories is empty, the <b>postfix</b>(1) command runs in single-instance mode and operates on a single Postfix instance only. Otherwise, the  <b>postfix</b>(1) command runs in multi-instance mode and invokes the multi-instance manager specified with the multi_instance_wrapper parameter. The multi-instance manager in turn executes  <b>postfix</b>(1) commands for the default instance and for all Postfix instances in $multi_instance_directories.<p>
Currently, this parameter setting is ignored except for the default main.cf file.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>multi_instance_enable (default: no)</h1> Allow this Postfix instance to be started, stopped, etc., by a multi-instance manager.

This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>multi_instance_group (default: empty)</h1> The optional instance group name of this Postfix instance. A group identifies closely-related Postfix instances that the multi-instance manager can start, stop, etc., as a unit.  This parameter is reserved for the multi-instance manager.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.</div>

<h1>multi_instance_wrapper (default: empty)</h1> The pathname of a multi-instance manager command that the  <b>postfix</b>(1) command invokes when the multi_instance_directories parameter value is non-empty. The pathname may be followed by initial command arguments separated by whitespace; shell metacharacters such as quotes are not supported in this context.<p>
The <b>postfix</b>(1) command invokes the manager command with the  <b>postfix</b>(1) non-option command arguments on the manager command line, and with all installation configuration parameters exported into the manager command process environment. The manager command in turn invokes the  <b>postfix</b>(1) command for individual Postfix instances as "postfix -c  <i>config_directory</i> <i>command</i>".<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>multi_recipient_bounce_reject_code (default: 550)</h1> The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a remote SMTP client request is blocked by the reject_multi_recipient_bounce restriction.<p>
Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mydestination (default: $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost)</h1> The list of domains that are delivered via the $local_transport mail delivery transport. By default this is the Postfix  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent which looks up all recipients in /etc/passwd and /etc/aliases. The SMTP server validates recipient addresses with $local_recipient_maps and rejects non-existent recipients. See also the local domain class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.<p>
The default mydestination value specifies names for the local machine only.  On a mail domain gateway, you should also include $mydomain.<p>
The $local_transport delivery method is also selected for mail addressed to user@[the.net.work.address] of the mail system (the IP addresses specified with the inet_interfaces and proxy_interfaces parameters).<p>
Warnings:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Do not specify the names of virtual domains - those domains are specified elsewhere. See VIRTUAL_README for more information.</dd>

<p>
Specify a list of host or domain names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name matches a lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain $mydomain<br>
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain www.$mydomain, ftp.$mydomain<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mydomain (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> The internet domain name of this mail system.  The default is to use $myhostname minus the first component, or "localdomain" (Postfix 2.3 and later).  $mydomain is used as a default value for many other configuration parameters.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
mydomain = domain.tld<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>myhostname (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> The internet hostname of this mail system. The default is to use the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) from gethostname(), or to use the non-FQDN result from gethostname() and append ".$mydomain". $myhostname is used as a default value for many other configuration parameters.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
myhostname = host.example.com<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>mynetworks (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> The list of "trusted" remote SMTP clients that have more privileges than "strangers".<p>
In particular, "trusted" SMTP clients are allowed to relay mail through Postfix.  See the smtpd_relay_restrictions parameter description in the  <b>postconf</b>(5) manual.<p>
You can specify the list of "trusted" network addresses by hand or you can let Postfix do it for you (which is the default). See the description of the mynetworks_style parameter for more information.<p>
If you specify the mynetworks list by hand, Postfix ignores the mynetworks_style setting.<p>
Specify a list of network addresses or network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace.<p>
The netmask specifies the number of bits in the network part of a host address.  You can also specify "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns.  A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).<p>
The list is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match.  Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.<p>
Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in the mynetworks value, and in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":" character, and would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 168.100.189.0/28<br>
mynetworks = !192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.0/28<br>
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 168.100.189.0/28 [::1]/128 [2001:240:587::]/64<br>

<div class="section">
<h1>notify_classes (default: resource, software)</h1> The list of error classes that are reported to the postmaster. The default is to report only the most serious problems. The paranoid may wish to turn on the policy (UCE and mail relaying) and protocol error (broken mail software) reports.<p>

<h1>postscreen_cache_cleanup_interval (default: 12h)</h1> The amount of time between  <b>postscreen</b>(8) cache cleanup runs. Cache cleanup increases the load on the cache database and should therefore not be run frequently. This feature requires that the cache database supports the "delete" and "sequence" operators. Specify a zero interval to disable cache cleanup.<p>
After each cache cleanup run, the <b>postscreen</b>(8) daemon logs the number of entries that were retained and dropped. A cleanup run is logged as "partial" when the daemon terminates early after " <b>postfix</b>  <b>reload</b>", "<b>postfix stop</b>", or no requests for $max_idle seconds.<p>

<h1>postscreen_whitelist_interfaces (default: static:all)</h1> A list of local  <b>postscreen</b>(8) server IP addresses where a non-whitelisted remote SMTP client can obtain  <b>postscreen</b>(8)'s temporary whitelist status. This status is required before the client can talk to a Postfix SMTP server process.  By default, a client can obtain  <b>postscreen</b>(8)'s whitelist status on any local <b>postscreen</b>(8) server IP address.<p>
When <b>postscreen</b>(8) listens on both primary and backup MX addresses, the postscreen_whitelist_interfaces parameter can be configured to give the temporary whitelist status only when a client connects to a primary MX address. Once a client is whitelisted it can talk to a Postfix SMTP server on any address. Thus, clients that connect only to backup MX addresses will never become whitelisted, and will never be allowed to talk to a Postfix SMTP server process.<p>
Specify a list of network addresses or network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The netmask specifies the number of bits in the network part of a host address. Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace.<p>
You can also specify "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns.  A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).<p>
The list is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block from the list.<p>
Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in the postscreen_whitelist_interfaces value, and in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":" character, and would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
/etc/postfix/main.cf:<br>
    # Don't whitelist connections to the backup IP address.<br>
    postscreen_whitelist_interfaces = !168.100.189.8, static:all<br>

This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>prepend_delivered_header (default: command, file, forward)</h1> The message delivery contexts where the Postfix  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent prepends a Delivered-To:  message header with the address that the mail was delivered to. This information is used for mail delivery loop detection.<p>
By default, the Postfix local delivery agent prepends a Delivered-To: header when forwarding mail and when delivering to file (mailbox) and command. Turning off the Delivered-To: header when forwarding mail is not recommended.<p>
Specify zero or more of <b>forward</b>, <b>file</b>, or <b>command</b>.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>

<div class="section">
<h1>propagate_unmatched_extensions (default: canonical, virtual)</h1> What address lookup tables copy an address extension from the lookup key to the lookup result.<p>
For example, with a <b>virtual</b>(5) mapping of "<i>joe@example.com =&gt;</i>  <i>joe.user@example.net</i>", the address "<i>joe+foo@example.com</i>" would rewrite to " <i>joe.user+foo@example.net</i>".<p>
Specify zero or more of <b>canonical</b>, <b>virtual</b>, <b>alias</b>,  <b>forward</b>, <b>include</b> or <b>generic</b>. These cause address extension propagation with  <b>canonical</b>(5), <b>virtual</b>(5), and <b>aliases</b>(5) maps, with  <b>local</b>(8) .forward and :include: file lookups, and with <b>smtp</b>(8) generic maps, respectively.<p>
Note: enabling this feature for types other than <b>canonical</b> and  <b>virtual</b> is likely to cause problems when mail is forwarded to other sites, especially with mail that is sent to a mailing list exploder address.<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>qmqpd_authorized_clients (default: empty)</h1> What remote QMQP clients are allowed to connect to the Postfix QMQP server port.<p>
By default, no client is allowed to use the service. This is because the QMQP server will relay mail to any destination.<p>
Specify a list of client patterns. A list pattern specifies a host name, a domain name, an internet address, or a network/mask pattern, where the mask specifies the number of bits in the network part. When a pattern specifies a file name, its contents are substituted for the file name; when a pattern is a "type:table" table specification, table lookup is used instead.<p>
Patterns are separated by whitespace and/or commas. In order to reverse the result, precede a pattern with an exclamation point (!). The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>queue_minfree (default: 0)</h1> The minimal amount of free space in bytes in the queue file system that is needed to receive mail.  This is currently used by the Postfix SMTP server to decide if it will accept any mail at all.<p>
By default, the Postfix SMTP server rejects MAIL FROM commands when the amount of free space is less than 1.5*$message_size_limit (Postfix version 2.1 and later). To specify a higher minimum free space limit, specify a queue_minfree value that is at least 1.5*$message_size_limit.<p>
With Postfix versions 2.0 and earlier, a queue_minfree value of zero means there is no minimum required amount of free space.</div>
<div class="section">

Specify the types and names of databases to use.  After change, run " <b>postmap /etc/postfix/recipient_bcc</b>".<p>
Note: with Postfix 2.3 and later the BCC address is added as if it was specified with NOTIFY=NONE. The sender will not be notified when the BCC address is undeliverable, as long as all down-stream software implements RFC 3461.<p>
Note: with Postfix 2.2 and earlier the sender will be notified when the BCC address is undeliverable.<p>
Note: automatic BCC recipients are produced only for new mail. To avoid mailer loops, automatic BCC recipients are not generated after Postfix forwards mail internally, or after Postfix generates mail itself.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
recipient_bcc_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/recipient_bcc<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>recipient_canonical_classes (default: envelope_recipient, header_recipient)</h1> What addresses are subject to recipient_canonical_maps address mapping.  By default, recipient_canonical_maps address mapping is applied to envelope recipient addresses, and to header recipient addresses.<p>
Specify one or more of: envelope_recipient, header_recipient<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>recipient_canonical_maps (default: empty)</h1> Optional address mapping lookup tables for envelope and header recipient addresses. The table format and lookups are documented in  <b>canonical</b>(5).<p>
Note: $recipient_canonical_maps is processed before $canonical_maps.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
recipient_canonical_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/recipient_canonical<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>recipient_delimiter (default: empty)</h1> The set of characters that can separate a user name from its extension (example: user+foo), or a .forward file name from its extension (example: .forward+foo).  Basically, the software tries user+foo and .forward+foo before trying user and .forward.  This implementation recognizes one delimiter character and one extension per email address or .forward file name.<p>
When the recipient_delimiter set contains multiple characters (Postfix 2.11 and later), a user name or .forward file name is separated from its extension by the first character that matches the recipient_delimiter set.<p>
See <b>canonical</b>(5), <b>local</b>(8), <b>relocated</b>(5) and <b>virtual</b>(5) for the effects of recipient_delimiter on lookups in aliases, canonical, virtual, and relocated maps, and see the propagate_unmatched_extensions parameter for propagating an extension from one email address to another.<p>
When used in command_execution_directory, forward_path, or luser_relay, ${recipient_delimiter} is replaced with the actual recipient delimiter that was found in the recipient email address (Postfix 2.11 and later), or it is replaced with the main.cf recipient_delimiter parameter value (Postfix 2.10 and earlier).<p>
The recipient_delimiter is not applied to the mailer-daemon address, the postmaster address, or the double-bounce address. With the default "owner_request_special = yes" setting, the recipient_delimiter is also not applied to addresses with the special "owner-" prefix or the special "-request" suffix.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
# Handle Postfix-style extensions.<br>
recipient_delimiter = +<br>
<p>
<br>
# Handle both Postfix and qmail extensions (Postfix 2.11 and later).<br>
recipient_delimiter = +-<br>
<p>
<br>
# Use .forward for mail without address extension, and for mail with<br>
# an unrecognized address extension.<br>
forward_path = $home/.forward${recipient_delimiter}${extension},<br>
    $home/.forward<br>

<div class="section">
<h1>reject_code (default: 554)</h1> The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a remote SMTP client request is rejected by the "reject" restriction.<p>
Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>reject_tempfail_action (default: defer_if_permit)</h1> The Postfix SMTP server's action when a reject-type restriction fails due to a temporary error condition. Specify "defer" to defer the remote SMTP client request immediately. With the default "defer_if_permit" action, the Postfix SMTP server continues to look for opportunities to reject mail, and defers the client request only if it would otherwise be accepted.<p>
For finer control, see: unverified_recipient_tempfail_action, unverified_sender_tempfail_action, unknown_address_tempfail_action, and unknown_helo_hostname_tempfail_action.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>relay_clientcerts (default: empty)</h1> List of tables with remote SMTP client-certificate fingerprints or public key fingerprints (Postfix 2.9 and later) for which the Postfix SMTP server will allow access with the permit_tls_clientcerts feature.  The fingerprint digest algorithm is configurable via the smtpd_tls_fingerprint_digest parameter (hard-coded as md5 prior to Postfix version 2.5).<p>
Postfix lookup tables are in the form of (key, value) pairs. Since we only need the key, the value can be chosen freely, e.g. the name of the user or host: D7:04:2F:A7:0B:8C:A5:21:FA:31:77:E1:41:8A:EE:80 lutzpc.at.home<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
relay_clientcerts = hash:/etc/postfix/relay_clientcerts<br>
<p>
For more fine-grained control, use check_ccert_access to select an appropriate  <b>access</b>(5) policy for each client. See RESTRICTION_CLASS_README.<p>
<b>Note:</b> Postfix 2.9.0-2.9.5 computed the public key fingerprint incorrectly. To use public-key fingerprints, upgrade to Postfix 2.9.6 or later.<p>
This feature is available with Postfix version 2.2.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>relay_destination_concurrency_limit (default: $default_destination_concurrency_limit)</h1> The maximal number of parallel deliveries to the same destination via the relay message delivery transport. This limit is enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry in the master.cf file.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>relay_destination_recipient_limit (default: $default_destination_recipient_limit)</h1> The maximal number of recipients per message for the relay message delivery transport. This limit is enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry in the master.cf file.<p>
Setting this parameter to a value of 1 changes the meaning of relay_destination_concurrency_limit from concurrency per domain into concurrency per recipient.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>relay_domains (default: $mydestination)</h1> What destination domains (and subdomains thereof) this system will relay mail to. Subdomain matching is controlled with the parent_domain_matches_subdomains parameter. For details about how the relay_domains value is used, see the description of the permit_auth_destination and reject_unauth_destination SMTP recipient restrictions.<p>
Domains that match $relay_domains are delivered with the $relay_transport mail delivery transport. The SMTP server validates recipient addresses with $relay_recipient_maps and rejects non-existent recipients. See also the relay domains address class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.<p>
Note: Postfix will not automatically forward mail for domains that list this system as their primary or backup MX host. See the permit_mx_backup restriction in the  <b>postconf</b>(5) manual page.<p>
Specify a list of host or domain names, "/file/name" patterns or "type:table" lookup tables, separated by commas and/or whitespace. Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a (parent) domain appears as lookup key. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a domain from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>relay_domains_reject_code (default: 554)</h1> The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a client request is rejected by the reject_unauth_destination recipient restriction.<p>
Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>relay_recipient_maps (default: empty)</h1> Optional lookup tables with all valid addresses in the domains that match $relay_domains. Specify @domain as a wild-card for domains that have no valid recipient list, and become a source of backscatter mail: Postfix accepts spam for non-existent recipients and then floods innocent people with undeliverable mail.  Technically, tables listed with $relay_recipient_maps are used as lists: Postfix needs to know only if a lookup string is found or not, but it does not use the result from table lookup.<p>
If this parameter is non-empty, then the Postfix SMTP server will reject mail to unknown relay users. This feature is off by default.<p>
See also the relay domains address class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
relay_recipient_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/relay_recipients<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>relay_transport (default: relay)</h1> The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for remote delivery to domains listed with $relay_domains. In order of decreasing precedence, the nexthop destination is taken from $relay_transport, $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps, $relayhost, or from the recipient domain. This information can be overruled with the  <b>transport</b>(5) table.<p>
Specify a string of the form <i>transport:nexthop</i>, where <i>transport</i> is the name of a mail delivery transport defined in master.cf. The  <i>:nexthop</i> destination is optional; its syntax is documented in the manual page of the corresponding delivery agent.<p>
See also the relay domains address class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>relayhost (default: empty)</h1> The next-hop destination of non-local mail; overrides non-local domains in recipient addresses. This information is overruled with relay_transport, sender_dependent_default_transport_maps, default_transport, sender_dependent_relayhost_maps and with the  <b>transport</b>(5) table.<p>
On an intranet, specify the organizational domain name. If your internal DNS uses no MX records, specify the name of the intranet gateway host instead.<p>
In the case of SMTP, specify a domain name, hostname, hostname:port, [hostname]:port, [hostaddress] or [hostaddress]:port. The form [hostname] turns off MX lookups.<p>
If you're connected via UUCP, see the UUCP_README file for useful information.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
relayhost = $mydomain<br>

Examples:<p>
The safe setting: append "domain.invalid" to incomplete header addresses from remote SMTP clients, so that those addresses cannot be confused with local addresses.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h1>require_home_directory (default: no)</h1> Require that a  <b>local</b>(8) recipient's home directory exists before mail delivery is attempted. By default this test is disabled. It can be useful for environments that import home directories to the mail server (IMPORTING HOME DIRECTORIES IS NOT RECOMMENDED).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>reset_owner_alias (default: no)</h1> Reset the  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent's idea of the owner-alias attribute, when delivering mail to a child alias that does not have its own owner alias.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later. With older Postfix releases, the behavior is as if this parameter is set to "yes".<p>
As documented in <b>aliases</b>(5), when an alias <i>name</i> has a companion alias named owner- <i>name</i>, delivery errors will be reported to the owner alias instead of the sender. This configuration is recommended for mailing lists.<p>
A less known property of the owner alias is that it also forces the  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent to write local and remote addresses from alias expansion to a new queue file, instead of attempting to deliver mail to local addresses as soon as they come out of alias expansion.<p>
Writing local addresses from alias expansion to a new queue file allows for robust handling of temporary delivery errors: errors with one local member have no effect on deliveries to other members of the list.  On the other hand, delivery to local addresses as soon as they come out of alias expansion is fragile: a temporary error with one local address from alias expansion will cause the entire alias to be expanded repeatedly until the error goes away, or until the message expires in the queue.  In that case, a problem with one list member results in multiple message deliveries to other list members.<p>
The default behavior of Postfix 2.8 and later is to keep the owner-alias attribute of the parent alias, when delivering mail to a child alias that does not have its own owner alias. Then, local addresses from that child alias will be written to a new queue file, and a temporary error with one local address will not affect delivery to other mailing list members.<p>
Unfortunately, older Postfix releases reset the owner-alias attribute when delivering mail to a child alias that does not have its own owner alias.  The  <b>local</b>(8) delivery agent then attempts to deliver local addresses as soon as they come out of child alias expansion.  If delivery to any address from child alias expansion fails with a temporary error condition, the entire mailing list may be expanded repeatedly until the mail expires in the queue, resulting in multiple deliveries of the same message to mailing list members.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>resolve_dequoted_address (default: yes)</h1> Resolve a recipient address safely instead of correctly, by looking inside quotes.<p>
By default, the Postfix address resolver does not quote the address localpart as per RFC 822, so that additional @ or % or ! operators remain visible. This behavior is safe but it is also technically incorrect.<p>
If you specify "resolve_dequoted_address = no", then the Postfix resolver will not know about additional @ etc. operators in the address localpart. This opens opportunities for obscure mail relay attacks with user@domain@domain addresses when Postfix provides backup MX service for Sendmail systems.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>resolve_null_domain (default: no)</h1> Resolve an address that ends in the "@" null domain as if the local hostname were specified, instead of rejecting the address as invalid.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later. Earlier versions always resolve the null domain as the local hostname.<p>
The Postfix SMTP server uses this feature to reject mail from or to addresses that end in the "@" null domain, and from addresses that rewrite into a form that ends in the "@" null domain.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>resolve_numeric_domain (default: no)</h1> Resolve "user@ipaddress" as "user@[ipaddress]", instead of rejecting the address as invalid.<p>

<h1>rewrite_service_name (default: rewrite)</h1> The name of the address rewriting service. This service rewrites addresses to standard form and resolves them to a (delivery method, next-hop host, recipient) triple.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>sample_directory (default: /etc/postfix)</h1> The name of the directory with example Postfix configuration files. Starting with Postfix 2.1, these files have been replaced with the  <b>postconf</b>(5) manual page.</div>

<h1>send_cyrus_sasl_authzid (default: no)</h1> When authenticating to a remote SMTP or LMTP server with the default setting "no", send no SASL authoriZation ID (authzid); send only the SASL authentiCation ID (authcid) plus the authcid's password.<p>
The non-default setting "yes" enables the behavior of older Postfix versions.  These always send a SASL authzid that is equal to the SASL authcid, but this causes inter-operability problems with some SMTP servers.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.4.4 and later.</div>

<h1>smtp_connection_cache_on_demand (default: yes)</h1> Temporarily enable SMTP connection caching while a destination has a high volume of mail in the active queue.  With SMTP connection caching, a connection is not closed immediately after completion of a mail transaction.  Instead, the connection is kept open for up to $smtp_connection_cache_time_limit seconds.  This allows connections to be reused for other deliveries, and can improve mail delivery performance.<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_connection_reuse_count_limit (default: 0)</h1> When SMTP connection caching is enabled, the number of times that an SMTP session may be reused before it is closed, or zero (no limit).  With a reuse count limit of N, a connection is used up to N+1 times.<p>
NOTE: This feature is unsafe. When a high-volume destination has multiple inbound MTAs, then the slowest inbound MTA will attract the most connections to that destination.  This limitation does not exist with the smtp_connection_reuse_time_limit feature.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.11.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_connection_reuse_time_limit (default: 300s)</h1> The amount of time during which Postfix will use an SMTP connection repeatedly.  The timer starts when the connection is initiated (i.e. it includes the connect, greeting and helo latency, in addition to the latencies of subsequent mail delivery transactions).<p>
This feature addresses a performance stability problem with remote SMTP servers. This problem is not specific to Postfix: it can happen when any MTA sends large amounts of SMTP email to a site that has multiple MX hosts.<p>
The problem starts when one of a set of MX hosts becomes slower than the rest.  Even though SMTP clients connect to fast and slow MX hosts with equal probability, the slow MX host ends up with more simultaneous inbound connections than the faster MX hosts, because the slow MX host needs more time to serve each client request.<p>
The slow MX host becomes a connection attractor.  If one MX host becomes N times slower than the rest, it dominates mail delivery latency unless there are more than N fast MX hosts to counter the effect. And if the number of MX hosts is smaller than N, the mail delivery latency becomes effectively that of the slowest MX host divided by the total number of MX hosts.<p>
The solution uses connection caching in a way that differs from Postfix version 2.2.  By limiting the amount of time during which a connection can be used repeatedly (instead of limiting the number of deliveries over that connection), Postfix not only restores fairness in the distribution of simultaneous connections across a set of MX hosts, it also favors deliveries over connections that perform well, which is exactly what we want.<p>
The default reuse time limit, 300s, is comparable to the various smtp transaction timeouts which are fair estimates of maximum excess latency for a slow delivery.  Note that hosts may accept thousands of messages over a single connection within the default connection reuse time limit. This number is much larger than the default Postfix version 2.2 limit of 10 messages per cached connection. It may prove necessary to lower the limit to avoid interoperability issues with MTAs that exhibit bugs when many messages are delivered via a single connection. A lower reuse time limit risks losing the benefit of connection reuse when the average connection and mail delivery latency exceeds the reuse time limit.<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_data_done_timeout (default: 600s)</h1> The Postfix SMTP client time limit for sending the SMTP ".", and for receiving the remote SMTP server response.<p>
When no response is received within the deadline, a warning is logged that the mail may be delivered multiple times.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_data_xfer_timeout (default: 180s)</h1> The Postfix SMTP client time limit for sending the SMTP message content. When the connection makes no progress for more than $smtp_data_xfer_timeout seconds the Postfix SMTP client terminates the transfer.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_defer_if_no_mx_address_found (default: no)</h1> Defer mail delivery when no MX record resolves to an IP address.<p>
The default (no) is to return the mail as undeliverable. With older Postfix versions the default was to keep trying to deliver the mail until someone fixed the MX record or until the mail was too old.<p>
Note: the Postfix SMTP client always ignores MX records with equal or worse preference than the local MTA itself.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_destination_concurrency_limit (default: $default_destination_concurrency_limit)</h1> The maximal number of parallel deliveries to the same destination via the smtp message delivery transport.

Specify one of the following:<dl>
<dt>
<b>disabled</b></dt>
<dd>
Disable DNS lookups.  No MX lookups are performed and hostname to address lookups are unconditionally "native".  This setting is not appropriate for hosts that deliver mail to the public Internet.

&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>enabled</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable DNS lookups.  Nexthop destination domains not enclosed in "[]" will be subject to MX lookups.  If "dns" and "native" are included in the "smtp_host_lookup" parameter value, DNS will be queried first to resolve MX-host A records, followed by "native" lookups if no answer is found in DNS.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

<dl>
<dt>

Temporary failures in DNSSEC-enabled hostname-to-address resolution block any "native" lookups.  Additional "native" lookups only happen when DNSSEC lookups hard-fail (NODATA or NXDOMAIN).<div style="height: 0.00em;">

<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The Postfix SMTP client considers non-MX "[nexthop]" and "[nexthop]:port" destinations equivalent to statically-validated MX records of the form "nexthop.  IN MX 0 nexthop."  Therefore, with "dnssec" support turned on, validated hostname-to-address lookups apply to the nexthop domain of any "[nexthop]" or "[nexthop]:port" destination.  This is also true for LMTP "inet:host" and "inet:host:port" destinations, as LMTP hostnames are never subject to MX lookups.<p>
The "dnssec" setting is recommended only if you plan to use the dane or dane-only TLS security level, otherwise enabling DNSSEC support in Postfix offers no additional security.  Postfix DNSSEC support relies on an upstream recursive nameserver that validates DNSSEC signatures.  Such a DNS server will always filter out forged DNS responses, even when Postfix itself is not configured to use DNSSEC.<p>
When using Postfix DANE support the "smtp_host_lookup" parameter should include "dns", as DANE is not applicable to hosts resolved via "native" lookups.<p>
As mentioned above, Postfix is not a validating stub resolver; it relies on the system's configured DNSSEC-validating recursive nameserver to perform all DNSSEC validation.  Since this nameserver's DNSSEC-validated responses will be fully trusted, it is strongly recommended that the MTA host have a local DNSSEC-validating recursive caching nameserver listening on a loopback address, and be configured to use only this nameserver for all lookups.  Otherwise, Postfix may remain subject to man-in-the-middle attacks that forge responses from the recursive nameserver<p>
DNSSEC support requires a version of Postfix compiled against a reasonably-modern DNS  <b>resolver</b>(3) library that implements the RES_USE_DNSSEC and RES_USE_EDNS0 resolver options.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_enforce_tls (default: no)</h1> Enforcement mode: require that remote SMTP servers use TLS encryption, and never send mail in the clear.  This also requires that the remote SMTP server hostname matches the information in the remote server certificate, and that the remote SMTP server certificate was issued by a CA that is trusted by the Postfix SMTP client. If the certificate doesn't verify or the hostname doesn't match, delivery is deferred and mail stays in the queue.<p>
The server hostname is matched against all names provided as dNSNames in the SubjectAlternativeName.  If no dNSNames are specified, the CommonName is checked.  The behavior may be changed with the smtp_tls_enforce_peername option.<p>
This option is useful only if you are definitely sure that you will only connect to servers that support RFC 2487 _and_ that provide valid server certificates.  Typical use is for clients that send all their email to a dedicated mailhub.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later. With Postfix 2.3 and later use smtp_tls_security_level instead.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_fallback_relay (default: $fallback_relay)</h1> Optional list of relay hosts for SMTP destinations that can't be found or that are unreachable. With Postfix 2.2 and earlier this parameter is called fallback_relay.<p>
By default, mail is returned to the sender when a destination is not found, and delivery is deferred when a destination is unreachable.<p>
With bulk email deliveries, it can be beneficial to run the fallback relay MTA on the same host, so that it can reuse the sender IP address.  This speeds up deliveries that are delayed by IP-based reputation systems (greylist, etc.).<p>
The fallback relays must be SMTP destinations. Specify a domain, host, host:port, [host]:port, [address] or [address]:port; the form [host] turns off MX lookups.  If you specify multiple SMTP destinations, Postfix will try them in the specified order.<p>
To prevent mailer loops between MX hosts and fall-back hosts, Postfix version 2.2 and later will not use the fallback relays for destinations that it is MX host for (assuming DNS lookup is turned on).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_generic_maps (default: empty)</h1> Optional lookup tables that perform address rewriting in the Postfix SMTP client, typically to transform a locally valid address into a globally valid address when sending mail across the Internet. This is needed when the local machine does not have its own Internet domain name, but uses something like  <i>localdomain.local</i> instead.<p>
The table format and lookups are documented in <b>generic</b>(5); examples are shown in the ADDRESS_REWRITING_README and STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README documents.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">

The Postfix limit of 998 characters not including &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; is consistent with the SMTP limit of 1000 characters including &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.  The Postfix limit was 990 with Postfix 2.8 and earlier.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_mail_timeout (default: 300s)</h1> The Postfix SMTP client time limit for sending the MAIL FROM command, and for receiving the remote SMTP server response.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_mime_header_checks (default: empty)</h1> Restricted  <b>mime_header_checks</b>(5) tables for the Postfix SMTP client. These tables are searched while mail is being delivered. Actions that change the delivery time or destination are not available.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_mx_address_limit (default: 5)</h1> The maximal number of MX (mail exchanger) IP addresses that can result from Postfix SMTP client mail exchanger lookups, or zero (no limit). Prior to Postfix version 2.3, this limit was disabled by default.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_mx_session_limit (default: 2)</h1> The maximal number of SMTP sessions per delivery request before the Postfix SMTP client gives up or delivers to a fall-back relay host, or zero (no limit). This restriction ignores sessions that fail to complete the SMTP initial handshake (Postfix version 2.2 and earlier) or that fail to complete the EHLO and TLS handshake (Postfix version 2.3 and later).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_nested_header_checks (default: empty)</h1> Restricted  <b>nested_header_checks</b>(5) tables for the Postfix SMTP client. These tables are searched while mail is being delivered. Actions that change the delivery time or destination are not available.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_never_send_ehlo (default: no)</h1> Never send EHLO at the start of an SMTP session. See also the smtp_always_send_ehlo parameter.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_per_record_deadline (default: no)</h1> Change the behavior of the smtp_*_timeout time limits, from a time limit per read or write system call, to a time limit to send or receive a complete record (an SMTP command line, SMTP response line, SMTP message content line, or TLS protocol message).  This limits the impact from hostile peers that trickle data one byte at a time.<p>
Note: when per-record deadlines are enabled, a short timeout may cause problems with TLS over very slow network connections. The reasons are that a TLS protocol message can be up to 16 kbytes long (with TLSv1), and that an entire TLS protocol message must be sent or received within the per-record deadline.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later. With older Postfix releases, the behavior is as if this parameter is set to "no".</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_pix_workaround_delay_time (default: 10s)</h1> How long the Postfix SMTP client pauses before sending ".&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;" in order to work around the PIX firewall "&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;" bug.<p>
Choosing a too short time makes this workaround ineffective when sending large messages over slow network connections.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_pix_workaround_maps (default: empty)</h1> Lookup tables, indexed by the remote SMTP server address, with per-destination workarounds for CISCO PIX firewall bugs.  The table is not indexed by hostname for consistency with smtp_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.4 and later.</div>
<div class="section">

By default, the workaround is turned off for mail that is queued for less than 500 seconds. In other words, the workaround is normally turned off for the first delivery attempt.<p>
Specify 0 to enable the PIX firewall "&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;" bug workaround upon the first delivery attempt.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_pix_workarounds (default: disable_esmtp, delay_dotcrlf)</h1> A list that specifies zero or more workarounds for CISCO PIX firewall bugs.

Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_quote_rfc821_envelope (default: yes)</h1> Quote addresses in Postfix SMTP client MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands as required by RFC 5321. This includes putting quotes around an address localpart that ends in ".".<p>

This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_randomize_addresses (default: yes)</h1> Randomize the order of equal-preference MX host addresses.  This is a performance feature of the Postfix SMTP client.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_rcpt_timeout (default: 300s)</h1> The Postfix SMTP client time limit for sending the SMTP RCPT TO command, and for receiving the remote SMTP server response.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_reply_filter (default: empty)</h1> A mechanism to transform replies from remote SMTP servers one line at a time.  This is a last-resort tool to work around server replies that break inter-operability with the Postfix SMTP client. Other uses involve fault injection to test Postfix's handling of invalid responses.<p>
Notes:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In the case of a multi-line reply, the Postfix SMTP client uses the final reply line's numerical SMTP reply code and enhanced status code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The numerical SMTP reply code (XYZ) takes precedence over the enhanced status code (X.Y.Z).  When the enhanced status code initial digit differs from the SMTP reply code initial digit, or when no enhanced status code is present, the Postfix SMTP client uses a generic enhanced status code (X.0.0) instead.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Specify the name of a "type:table" lookup table. The search string is a single SMTP reply line as received from the remote SMTP server, except that the trailing &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; are removed. When the lookup succeeds, the result replaces the single SMTP reply line.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
/etc/postfix/main.cf:<br>
    smtp_reply_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/reply_filter<br>
<p>
<br>
/etc/postfix/reply_filter:<br>
    # Transform garbage into "250-filler..." so that it looks like<br>
    # one line from a multi-line reply. It does not matter what we<br>
    # substitute here as long it has the right syntax.  The Postfix<br>
    # SMTP client will use the final line's numerical SMTP reply<br>
    # code and enhanced status code.<br>
    !/^([2-5][0-9][0-9]($|[- ]))/ 250-filler for garbage<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.7.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_rset_timeout (default: 20s)</h1> The Postfix SMTP client time limit for sending the RSET command, and for receiving the remote SMTP server response. The SMTP client sends RSET in order to finish a recipient address probe, or to verify that a cached session is still usable.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_sasl_auth_cache_name (default: empty)</h1> An optional table to prevent repeated SASL authentication failures with the same remote SMTP server hostname, username and password. Each table (key, value) pair contains a server name, a username and password, and the full server response. This information is stored when a remote SMTP server rejects an authentication attempt with a 535 reply code.  As long as the smtp_sasl_password_maps information does no change, and as long as the smtp_sasl_auth_cache_name information does not expire (see smtp_sasl_auth_cache_time) the Postfix SMTP client avoids SASL authentication attempts with the same server, username and password, and instead bounces or defers mail as controlled with the smtp_sasl_auth_soft_bounce configuration parameter.<p>
Use a per-destination delivery concurrency of 1 (for example, "smtp_destination_concurrency_limit = 1", "relay_destination_concurrency_limit = 1", etc.), otherwise multiple delivery agents may experience a login failure at the same time.<p>
The table must be accessed via the proxywrite service, i.e. the map name must start with "proxy:". The table should be stored under the directory specified with the data_directory parameter.<p>
This feature uses cryptographic hashing to protect plain-text passwords, and requires that Postfix is compiled with TLS support.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
smtp_sasl_auth_cache_name = proxy:btree:/var/db/postfix/sasl_auth_cache<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_sasl_auth_cache_time (default: 90d)</h1> The maximal age of an smtp_sasl_auth_cache_name entry before it is removed.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_sasl_auth_enable (default: no)</h1> Enable SASL authentication in the Postfix SMTP client.  By default, the Postfix SMTP client uses no authentication.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_sasl_auth_soft_bounce (default: yes)</h1> When a remote SMTP server rejects a SASL authentication request with a 535 reply code, defer mail delivery instead of returning mail as undeliverable. The latter behavior was hard-coded prior to Postfix version 2.5.<p>
Note: the setting "yes" overrides the global soft_bounce parameter, but the setting "no" does not.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
# Default as of Postfix 2.5<br>
smtp_sasl_auth_soft_bounce = yes<br>
# The old hard-coded default<br>
smtp_sasl_auth_soft_bounce = no<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter (default: empty)</h1> If non-empty, a Postfix SMTP client filter for the remote SMTP server's list of offered SASL mechanisms.  Different client and server implementations may support different mechanism lists; by default, the Postfix SMTP client will use the intersection of the two. smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter specifies an optional third mechanism list to intersect with.<p>
Specify mechanism names, "/file/name" patterns or "type:table" lookup tables. The right-hand side result from "type:table" lookups is ignored. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a mechanism name from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.<p>
Examples:<p>
<br>
smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = plain, login<br>
smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = /etc/postfix/smtp_mechs<br>
smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = !gssapi, !login, static:rest<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_sasl_password_maps (default: empty)</h1> Optional Postfix SMTP client lookup tables with one username:password entry per remote hostname or domain, or sender address when sender-dependent authentication is enabled.  If no username:password entry is found, then the Postfix SMTP client will not attempt to authenticate to the remote host.<p>
The Postfix SMTP client opens the lookup table before going to chroot jail, so you can leave the password file in /etc/postfix.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_sasl_path (default: empty)</h1> Implementation-specific information that the Postfix SMTP client passes through to the SASL plug-in implementation that is selected with  <b>smtp_sasl_type</b>.  Typically this specifies the name of a configuration file or rendezvous point.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_sasl_security_options (default: noplaintext, noanonymous)</h1> Postfix SMTP client SASL security options; as of Postfix 2.3 the list of available features depends on the SASL client implementation that is selected with  <b>smtp_sasl_type</b>.<p>
The following security features are defined for the <b>cyrus</b> client SASL implementation:<p>

<h1>smtp_sasl_tls_security_options (default: $smtp_sasl_security_options)</h1> The SASL authentication security options that the Postfix SMTP client uses for TLS encrypted SMTP sessions.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_sasl_tls_verified_security_options (default: $smtp_sasl_tls_security_options)</h1> The SASL authentication security options that the Postfix SMTP client uses for TLS encrypted SMTP sessions with a verified server certificate.<p>
When mail is sent to the public MX host for the recipient's domain, server certificates are by default optional, and delivery proceeds even if certificate verification fails. For delivery via a submission service that requires SASL authentication, it may be appropriate to send plaintext passwords only when the connection to the server is strongly encrypted  <b>and</b> the server identity is verified.<p>
The smtp_sasl_tls_verified_security_options parameter makes it possible to only enable plaintext mechanisms when a secure connection to the server is available. Submission servers subject to this policy must either have verifiable certificates or offer suitable non-plaintext SASL mechanisms.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_sasl_type (default: cyrus)</h1> The SASL plug-in type that the Postfix SMTP client should use for authentication.  The available types are listed with the " <b>postconf -A</b>" command.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_send_dummy_mail_auth (default: no)</h1> Whether or not to append the "AUTH=&lt;&gt;" option to the MAIL FROM command in SASL-authenticated SMTP sessions. The default is not to send this, to avoid problems with broken remote SMTP servers. Before Postfix 2.9 the behavior is as if "smtp_send_dummy_mail_auth = yes".<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_send_xforward_command (default: no)</h1> Send the non-standard XFORWARD command when the Postfix SMTP server EHLO response announces XFORWARD support.<p>
This allows a Postfix SMTP delivery agent, used for injecting mail into a content filter, to forward the name, address, protocol and HELO name of the original client to the content filter and downstream queuing SMTP server. This can produce more useful logging than localhost[127.0.0.1] etc.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_sender_dependent_authentication (default: no)</h1> Enable sender-dependent authentication in the Postfix SMTP client; this is available only with SASL authentication, and disables SMTP connection caching to ensure that mail from different senders will use the appropriate credentials.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_skip_4xx_greeting (default: yes)</h1> Skip SMTP servers that greet with a 4XX status code (go away, try again later).<p>
By default, the Postfix SMTP client moves on the next mail exchanger. Specify "smtp_skip_4xx_greeting = no" if Postfix should defer delivery immediately.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and earlier. Later Postfix versions always skip remote SMTP servers that greet with a 4XX status code.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_skip_5xx_greeting (default: yes)</h1> Skip remote SMTP servers that greet with a 5XX status code.<p>
By default, the Postfix SMTP client moves on the next mail exchanger. Specify "smtp_skip_5xx_greeting = no" if Postfix should bounce the mail immediately. Caution: the latter behavior appears to contradict RFC 2821.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_skip_quit_response (default: yes)</h1> Do not wait for the response to the SMTP QUIT command.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_starttls_timeout (default: 300s)</h1> Time limit for Postfix SMTP client write and read operations during TLS startup and shutdown handshake procedures.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_CAfile (default: empty)</h1> A file containing CA certificates of root CAs trusted to sign either remote SMTP server certificates or intermediate CA certificates. These are loaded into memory before the  <b>smtp</b>(8) client enters the chroot jail. If the number of trusted roots is large, consider using smtp_tls_CApath instead, but note that the latter directory must be present in the chroot jail if the  <b>smtp</b>(8) client is chrooted. This file may also be used to augment the client certificate trust chain, but it is best to include all the required certificates directly in $smtp_tls_cert_file.<p>
Specify "smtp_tls_CAfile = /path/to/system_CA_file" to use ONLY the system-supplied default certificate authority certificates.<p>
Specify "tls_append_default_CA = no" to prevent Postfix from appending the system-supplied default CAs and trusting third-party certificates.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/CAcert.pem<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_CApath (default: empty)</h1> Directory with PEM format certificate authority certificates that the Postfix SMTP client uses to verify a remote SMTP server certificate.  Don't forget to create the necessary "hash" links with, for example, "$OPENSSL_HOME/bin/c_rehash /etc/postfix/certs".<p>
To use this option in chroot mode, this directory (or a copy) must be inside the chroot jail.<p>
Specify "smtp_tls_CApath = /path/to/system_CA_directory" to use ONLY the system-supplied default certificate authority certificates.<p>
Specify "tls_append_default_CA = no" to prevent Postfix from appending the system-supplied default CAs and trusting third-party certificates.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
smtp_tls_CApath = /etc/postfix/certs<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_block_early_mail_reply (default: no)</h1> Try to detect a mail hijacking attack based on a TLS protocol vulnerability (CVE-2009-3555), where an attacker prepends malicious HELO, MAIL, RCPT, DATA commands to a Postfix SMTP client TLS session. The attack would succeed with non-Postfix SMTP servers that reply to the malicious HELO, MAIL, RCPT, DATA commands after negotiating the Postfix SMTP client TLS session.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.7.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_cert_file (default: empty)</h1> File with the Postfix SMTP client RSA certificate in PEM format. This file may also contain the Postfix SMTP client private RSA key, and these may be the same as the Postfix SMTP server RSA certificate and key file.<p>
Do not configure client certificates unless you <b>must</b> present client TLS certificates to one or more servers. Client certificates are not usually needed, and can cause problems in configurations that work well without them. The recommended setting is to let the defaults stand:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>

smtp_tls_dkey_file =<br>
smtp_tls_eccert_file =<br>
smtp_tls_eckey_file =<br>
<br>
<p>
The best way to use the default settings is to comment out the above parameters in main.cf if present.<p>
To enable remote SMTP servers to verify the Postfix SMTP client certificate, the issuing CA certificates must be made available to the server. You should include the required certificates in the client certificate file, the client certificate first, then the issuing CA(s) (bottom-up order).<p>
Example: the certificate for "client.example.com" was issued by "intermediate CA" which itself has a certificate issued by "root CA". Create the client.pem file with "cat client_cert.pem intermediate_CA.pem root_CA.pem &gt; client.pem".<p>
If you also want to verify remote SMTP server certificates issued by these CAs, you can add the CA certificates to the smtp_tls_CAfile, in which case it is not necessary to have them in the smtp_tls_cert_file, smtp_tls_dcert_file or smtp_tls_eccert_file.<p>
A certificate supplied here must be usable as an SSL client certificate and hence pass the "openssl verify -purpose sslclient ..." test.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
smtp_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/client.pem<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_cipherlist (default: empty)</h1> Obsolete Postfix &lt; 2.3 control for the Postfix SMTP client TLS cipher list. As this feature applies to all TLS security levels, it is easy to create inter-operability problems by choosing a non-default cipher list. Do not use a non-default TLS cipher list on hosts that deliver email to the public Internet: you will be unable to send email to servers that only support the ciphers you exclude. Using a restricted cipher list may be more appropriate for an internal MTA, where one can exert some control over the TLS software and settings of the peer servers.<p>
<b>Note:</b> do not use "" quotes around the parameter value.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix version 2.2. It is not used with Postfix 2.3 and later; use smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers instead.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_ciphers (default: export)</h1> The minimum TLS cipher grade that the Postfix SMTP client will use with opportunistic TLS encryption. Cipher types listed in smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers are excluded from the base definition of the selected cipher grade. The default value "export" ensures maximum inter-operability. Because encryption is optional, stronger controls are not appropriate, and this setting SHOULD NOT be changed unless the change is essential.<p>
When TLS is mandatory the cipher grade is chosen via the smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers configuration parameter, see there for syntax details. See smtp_tls_policy_maps for information on how to configure ciphers on a per-destination basis.<p>
Example:<br>
smtp_tls_ciphers = export<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later. With earlier Postfix releases only the smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers parameter is implemented, and opportunistic TLS always uses "export" or better (i.e. all) ciphers.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_dcert_file (default: empty)</h1> File with the Postfix SMTP client DSA certificate in PEM format. This file may also contain the Postfix SMTP client private DSA key.<p>

This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_dkey_file (default: $smtp_tls_dcert_file)</h1> File with the Postfix SMTP client DSA private key in PEM format. This file may be combined with the Postfix SMTP client DSA certificate file specified with $smtp_tls_dcert_file.<p>
The private key must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not be encrypted. File permissions should grant read-only access to the system superuser account ("root"), and no access to anyone else.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_eccert_file (default: empty)</h1> File with the Postfix SMTP client ECDSA certificate in PEM format. This file may also contain the Postfix SMTP client ECDSA private key.<p>
See the discussion under smtp_tls_cert_file for more details.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
smtp_tls_eccert_file = /etc/postfix/ecdsa-ccert.pem<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later, when Postfix is compiled and linked with OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_eckey_file (default: $smtp_tls_eccert_file)</h1> File with the Postfix SMTP client ECDSA private key in PEM format. This file may be combined with the Postfix SMTP client ECDSA certificate file specified with $smtp_tls_eccert_file.<p>
The private key must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not be encrypted. File permissions should grant read-only access to the system superuser account ("root"), and no access to anyone else.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later, when Postfix is compiled and linked with OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_enforce_peername (default: yes)</h1> With mandatory TLS encryption, require that the remote SMTP server hostname matches the information in the remote SMTP server certificate.  As of RFC 2487 the requirements for hostname checking for MTA clients are not specified.<p>
This option can be set to "no" to disable strict peer name checking. This setting has no effect on sessions that are controlled via the smtp_tls_per_site table.<p>
Disabling the hostname verification can make sense in closed environment where special CAs are created.  If not used carefully, this option opens the danger of a "man-in-the-middle" attack (the CommonName of this attacker will be logged).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later. With Postfix 2.3 and later use smtp_tls_security_level instead.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers (default: empty)</h1> List of ciphers or cipher types to exclude from the Postfix SMTP client cipher list at all TLS security levels. This is not an OpenSSL cipherlist, it is a simple list separated by whitespace and/or commas. The elements are a single cipher, or one or more "+" separated cipher properties, in which case only ciphers matching  <b>all</b> the properties are excluded.<p>

<h1>smtp_tls_fingerprint_cert_match (default: empty)</h1> List of acceptable remote SMTP server certificate fingerprints for the "fingerprint" TLS security level ( <b>smtp_tls_security_level</b> = fingerprint). At this security level, certificate authorities are not used, and certificate expiration times are ignored. Instead, server certificates are verified directly via their certificate fingerprint or public key fingerprint (Postfix 2.9 and later). The fingerprint is a message digest of the server certificate (or public key). The digest algorithm is selected via the  <b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest</b> parameter.<p>
When an <b>smtp_tls_policy_maps</b> table entry specifies the "fingerprint" security level, any "match" attributes in that entry specify the list of valid fingerprints for the corresponding destination. Multiple fingerprints can be combined with a "|" delimiter in a single match attribute, or multiple match attributes can be employed.<p>
Example: Certificate fingerprint verification with internal mailhub. Two matching fingerprints are listed. The relayhost may be multiple physical hosts behind a load-balancer, each with its own private/public key and self-signed certificate. Alternatively, a single relayhost may be in the process of switching from one set of private/public keys to another, and both keys are trusted just prior to the transition.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest (default: md5)</h1> The message digest algorithm used to construct remote SMTP server certificate fingerprints. At the "fingerprint" TLS security level ( <b>smtp_tls_security_level</b> = fingerprint), the server certificate is verified by directly matching its certificate fingerprint or its public key fingerprint (Postfix 2.9 and later). The fingerprint is the message digest of the server certificate (or its public key) using the selected algorithm. With a digest algorithm resistant to "second pre-image" attacks, it is not feasible to create a new public key and a matching certificate (or public/private key-pair) that has the same fingerprint.<p>
The default algorithm is <b>md5</b>; this is consistent with the backwards compatible setting of the digest used to verify client certificates in the SMTP server.<p>
The best practice algorithm is now <b>sha1</b>. Recent advances in hash function cryptanalysis have led to md5 being deprecated in favor of sha1. However, as long as there are no known "second pre-image" attacks against md5, its use in this context can still be considered safe.<p>
While additional digest algorithms are often available with OpenSSL's libcrypto, only those used by libssl in SSL cipher suites are available to Postfix. For now this means just md5 or sha1.<p>
To find the fingerprint of a specific certificate file, with a specific digest algorithm, run:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
$ openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -<i>digest</i> -in <i>certfile</i>.pem<br>
<br>
<p>
The text to the right of "=" sign is the desired fingerprint. For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
$ openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -in cert.pem<br>
SHA1 Fingerprint=D4:6A:AB:19:24:79:F8:32:BB:A6:CB:66:82:C0:8E:9B:EE:29:A8:1A<br>
<br>
<p>
To extract the public key fingerprint from an X.509 certificate, you need to extract the public key from the certificate and compute the appropriate digest of its DER (ASN.1) encoding. With OpenSSL the "-pubkey" option of the "x509" command extracts the public key always in "PEM" format. We pipe the result to another OpenSSL command that converts the key to DER and then to the "dgst" command to compute the fingerprint.<p>
The actual command to transform the key to DER format depends on the version of OpenSSL used. With OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later, the "pkey" command supports all key types. With OpenSSL 0.9.8 and earlier, the key type is always RSA (nobody uses DSA, and EC keys are not fully supported by 0.9.8), so the "rsa" command is used.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h1>smtp_tls_force_insecure_host_tlsa_lookup (default: no)</h1> Lookup the associated DANE TLSA RRset even when a hostname is not an alias and its address records lie in an unsigned zone.  This is unlikely to ever yield DNSSEC validated results, since child zones of unsigned zones are also unsigned in the absence of DLV or locally configured non-root trust-anchors.  We anticipate that such mechanisms will not be used for just the "_tcp" subdomain of a host. Suppressing the TLSA RRset lookup reduces latency and avoids potential interoperability problems with nameservers for unsigned zones that are not prepared to handle the new TLSA RRset.<p>

<h1>smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers (default: medium)</h1> The minimum TLS cipher grade that the Postfix SMTP client will use with mandatory TLS encryption.  The default value "medium" is suitable for most destinations with which you may want to enforce TLS, and is beyond the reach of today's cryptanalytic methods. See smtp_tls_policy_maps for information on how to configure ciphers on a per-destination basis.<p>
The following cipher grades are supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>export</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable "EXPORT" grade or better OpenSSL ciphers.  This is the default for opportunistic encryption. It is not recommended for mandatory encryption unless you must enforce TLS with "crippled" peers.

<dl>
<dt>
<b>low</b></dt>

<b>high</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable only "HIGH" grade OpenSSL ciphers.  This setting may be appropriate when all mandatory TLS destinations (e.g. when all mail is routed to a suitably capable relayhost) support at least one "HIGH" grade cipher.

&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>null</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable only the "NULL" OpenSSL ciphers, these provide authentication without encryption.  This setting is only appropriate in the rare case that all servers are prepared to use NULL ciphers (not normally enabled in TLS servers). A plausible use-case is an LMTP server listening on a UNIX-domain socket that is configured to support "NULL" ciphers. The underlying cipherlist is specified via the tls_null_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged to not change.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

<p>
The underlying cipherlists for grades other than "null" include anonymous ciphers, but these are automatically filtered out if the Postfix SMTP client is configured to verify server certificates. You are very unlikely to need to take any steps to exclude anonymous ciphers, they are excluded automatically as necessary.  If you must exclude anonymous ciphers at the "may" or "encrypt" security levels, when the Postfix SMTP client does not need or use peer certificates, set "smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = aNULL". To exclude anonymous ciphers only when TLS is enforced, set "smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers = aNULL".<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers (default: empty)</h1> Additional list of ciphers or cipher types to exclude from the Postfix SMTP client cipher list at mandatory TLS security levels. This list works in addition to the exclusions listed with smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers (see there for syntax details).<p>
Starting with Postfix 2.6, the mandatory cipher exclusions can be specified on a per-destination basis via the TLS policy "exclude" attribute. See smtp_tls_policy_maps for notes and examples.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols (default: !SSLv2)</h1> List of SSL/TLS protocols that the Postfix SMTP client will use with mandatory TLS encryption.  In main.cf the values are separated by whitespace, commas or colons. In the policy table "protocols" attribute (see smtp_tls_policy_maps) the only valid separator is colon. An empty value means allow all protocols. The valid protocol names, (see \fBfBSSL_get_version(3)), are "SSLv2", "SSLv3" and "TLSv1".<p>
With Postfix &gt;= 2.5 the parameter syntax was expanded to support protocol exclusions. One can explicitly exclude "SSLv2" by setting "smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2". To exclude both "SSLv2" and "SSLv3" set "smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3". Listing the protocols to include, rather than protocols to exclude, is supported, but not recommended. The exclusion form more closely matches the underlying OpenSSL interface semantics.<p>
The range of protocols advertised by an SSL/TLS client must be contiguous.  When a protocol version is enabled, disabling any higher version implicitly disables all versions above that higher version.  Thus, for example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !TLSv1<br>
<br>
also disables any protocols version higher than TLSv1 leaving only "SSLv3" enabled.<p>
Note: As of OpenSSL 1.0.1 two new protocols are defined, "TLSv1.1" and "TLSv1.2". When Postfix &lt;= 2.5 is linked against OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later, these, or any other new protocol versions, cannot be disabled except by also disabling "TLSv1" (typically leaving just "SSLv3").  The latest patch levels of Postfix &gt;= 2.6, and all versions of Postfix &gt;= 2.10 can explicitly disable support for "TLSv1.1" or "TLSv1.2".<p>
At the dane and dane-only security levels, when usable TLSA records are obtained for the remote SMTP server, the Postfix SMTP client is obligated to include the SNI TLS extension in its SSL client hello message.  This may help the remote SMTP server live up to its promise to provide a certificate that matches its TLSA records.  Since TLS extensions require TLS 1.0 or later, the Postfix SMTP client must disable "SSLv2" and "SSLv3" when SNI is required.  If you use "dane" or "dane-only" do not disable TLSv1, except perhaps via the policy table for destinations which you are sure will support "TLSv1.1" or "TLSv1.2".<p>
Since SSL version 2 has known protocol weaknesses and is now deprecated, the default setting excludes "SSLv2".  This means that by default, SSL version 2 will not be used at the "encrypt" security level and higher.<p>
See the documentation of the smtp_tls_policy_maps parameter and TLS_README for more information about security levels.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
# Preferred syntax with Postfix &gt;= 2.5:<br>
smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3<br>

<h1>smtp_tls_per_site (default: empty)</h1> Optional lookup tables with the Postfix SMTP client TLS usage policy by next-hop destination and by remote SMTP server hostname. When both lookups succeed, the more specific per-site policy (NONE, MUST, etc) overrides the less specific one (MAY), and the more secure per-site policy (MUST, etc) overrides the less secure one (NONE). With Postfix 2.3 and later smtp_tls_per_site is strongly discouraged: use smtp_tls_policy_maps instead.<p>
Use of the bare hostname as the per-site table lookup key is discouraged. Always use the full destination nexthop (enclosed in [] with a possible ":port" suffix). A recipient domain or MX-enabled transport next-hop with no port suffix may look like a bare hostname, but is still a suitable  <i>destination</i>.<p>
Specify a next-hop destination or server hostname on the left-hand side; no wildcards are allowed. The next-hop destination is either the recipient domain, or the destination specified with a  <b>transport</b>(5) table, the relayhost parameter, or the relay_transport parameter. On the right hand side specify one of the following keywords:<dl>
<dt>
NONE</dt>

The above keywords correspond to the "none", "may", "encrypt" and "verify" security levels for the new smtp_tls_security_level parameter introduced in Postfix 2.3. Starting with Postfix 2.3, and independently of how the policy is specified, the smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers and smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols parameters apply when TLS encryption is mandatory. Connections for which encryption is optional typically enable all "export" grade and better ciphers (see smtp_tls_ciphers and smtp_tls_protocols).<p>
As long as no secure DNS lookup mechanism is available, false hostnames in MX or CNAME responses can change the server hostname that Postfix uses for TLS policy lookup and server certificate verification. Even with a perfect match between the server hostname and the server certificate, there is no guarantee that Postfix is connected to the right server.  See TLS_README (Closing a DNS loophole with obsolete per-site TLS policies) for a possible work-around.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later. With Postfix 2.3 and later use smtp_tls_policy_maps instead.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_policy_maps (default: empty)</h1> Optional lookup tables with the Postfix SMTP client TLS security policy by next-hop destination; when a non-empty value is specified, this overrides the obsolete smtp_tls_per_site parameter.  See TLS_README for a more detailed discussion of TLS security levels.<p>
The TLS policy table is indexed by the full next-hop destination, which is either the recipient domain, or the verbatim next-hop specified in the transport table, $local_transport, $virtual_transport, $relay_transport or $default_transport. This includes any enclosing square brackets and any non-default destination server port suffix. The LMTP socket type prefix (inet: or unix:) is not included in the lookup key.<p>
Only the next-hop domain, or $myhostname with LMTP over UNIX-domain sockets, is used as the nexthop name for certificate verification. The port and any enclosing square brackets are used in the table lookup key, but are not used for server name verification.<p>
When the lookup key is a domain name without enclosing square brackets or any  <i>:port</i> suffix (typically the recipient domain), and the full domain is not found in the table, just as with the  <b>transport</b>(5) table, the parent domain starting with a leading "." is matched recursively. This allows one to specify a security policy for a recipient domain and all its sub-domains.<p>
The lookup result is a security level, followed by an optional list of whitespace and/or comma separated name=value attributes that override related main.cf settings. The TLS security levels in order of increasing security are:<dl>
<dt>
<b>none</b></dt>
<dd>
No TLS. No additional attributes are supported at this level.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

Opportunistic TLS. Since sending in the clear is acceptable, demanding stronger than default TLS security merely reduces inter-operability. The optional "ciphers", "exclude" and "protocols" attributes (available for opportunistic TLS with Postfix &gt;= 2.6) override the "smtp_tls_ciphers", "smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers" and "smtp_tls_protocols" configuration parameters. When opportunistic TLS handshakes fail, Postfix retries the connection with TLS disabled. This allows mail delivery to sites with non-interoperable TLS implementations.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

Certificate fingerprint verification. Available with Postfix 2.5 and later. At this security level, there are no trusted certificate authorities. The certificate trust chain, expiration date, ... are not checked. Instead, the optional  <b>match</b> attribute, or else the main.cf  <b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_cert_match</b> parameter, lists the certificate fingerprints or the public key fingerprint (Postfix 2.9 and later) of the valid server certificate. The digest algorithm used to calculate the fingerprint is selected by the  <b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest</b> parameter. Multiple fingerprints can be combined with a "|" delimiter in a single match attribute, or multiple match attributes can be employed.

<b>verify</b></dt>
<dd>
Mandatory TLS verification.  At this security level, DNS MX lookups are trusted to be secure enough, and the name verified in the server certificate is usually obtained indirectly via unauthenticated DNS MX lookups.  The optional "match" attribute overrides the main.cf smtp_tls_verify_cert_match parameter. In the policy table, multiple match patterns and strategies must be separated by colons.

<b>secure</b></dt>
<dd>
Secure-channel TLS. At this security level, DNS MX lookups, though potentially used to determine the candidate next-hop gateway IP addresses, are  <b>not</b> trusted to be secure enough for TLS peername verification. Instead, the default name verified in the server certificate is obtained directly from the next-hop, or is explicitly specified via the optional  <b>match</b> attribute which overrides the main.cf smtp_tls_secure_cert_match parameter. In the policy table, multiple match patterns and strategies must be separated by colons. The match attribute is most useful when multiple domains are supported by common server, the policy entries for additional domains specify matching rules for the primary domain certificate. While transport table overrides routing the secondary domains to the primary nexthop also allow secure verification, they risk delivery to the wrong destination when domains change hands or are re-assigned to new gateways. With the "match" attribute approach, routing is not perturbed, and mail is deferred if verification of a new MX host fails.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_protocols (default: !SSLv2)</h1> List of TLS protocols that the Postfix SMTP client will exclude or include with opportunistic TLS encryption. Starting with Postfix 2.6, the Postfix SMTP client will by default not use the obsolete SSLv2 protocol.<p>
In main.cf the values are separated by whitespace, commas or colons. In the policy table (see smtp_tls_policy_maps) the only valid separator is colon. An empty value means allow all protocols. The valid protocol names, (see \fBfBSSL_get_version(3)), are "SSLv2", "SSLv3" and "TLSv1".<p>
The range of protocols advertised by an SSL/TLS client must be contiguous.  When a protocol version is enabled, disabling any higher version implicitly disables all versions above that higher version.  Thus, for example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !TLSv1<br>
<br>
also disables any protocols version higher than TLSv1 leaving only "SSLv3" enabled.<p>
Note: As of OpenSSL 1.0.1 two new protocols are defined, "TLSv1.1" and "TLSv1.2". The latest patch levels of Postfix &gt;= 2.6, and all versions of Postfix &gt;= 2.10 can explicitly disable support for "TLSv1.1" or "TLSv1.2"<p>
To include a protocol list its name, to exclude it, prefix the name with a "!" character. To exclude SSLv2 even for opportunistic TLS set "smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2". To exclude both "SSLv2" and "SSLv3" set "smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3". Explicitly listing the protocols to include, rather than protocols to exclude, is supported, but not recommended.  The exclusion form more closely matches the underlying OpenSSL interface semantics.<p>
Example:<br>
# TLSv1 or better:<br>
smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3<br>

<h1>smtp_tls_scert_verifydepth (default: 9)</h1> The verification depth for remote SMTP server certificates. A depth of 1 is sufficient if the issuing CA is listed in a local CA file.<p>
The default verification depth is 9 (the OpenSSL default) for compatibility with earlier Postfix behavior. Prior to Postfix 2.5, the default value was 5, but the limit was not actually enforced. If you have set this to a lower non-default value, certificates with longer trust chains may now fail to verify. Certificate chains with 1 or 2 CAs are common, deeper chains are more rare and any number between 5 and 9 should suffice in practice. You can choose a lower number if, for example, you trust certificates directly signed by an issuing CA but not any CAs it delegates to.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_secure_cert_match (default: nexthop, dot-nexthop)</h1> How the Postfix SMTP client verifies the server certificate peername for the "secure" TLS security level. In a "secure" TLS policy table ($smtp_tls_policy_maps) entry the optional "match" attribute overrides this main.cf setting.<p>
This parameter specifies one or more patterns or strategies separated by commas, whitespace or colons.  In the policy table the only valid separator is the colon character.<p>
For a description of the pattern and strategy syntax see the smtp_tls_verify_cert_match parameter. The "hostname" strategy should be avoided in this context, as in the absence of a secure global DNS, using the results of MX lookups in certificate verification is not immune to active (man-in-the-middle) attacks on DNS.<p>

<h1>smtp_tls_security_level (default: empty)</h1> The default SMTP TLS security level for the Postfix SMTP client; when a non-empty value is specified, this overrides the obsolete parameters smtp_use_tls, smtp_enforce_tls, and smtp_tls_enforce_peername.<p>
Specify one of the following security levels:<dl>
<dt>
<b>none</b></dt>

No TLS. TLS will not be used unless enabled for specific destinations via smtp_tls_policy_maps.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

<dl>
<dt>
<b>may</b></dt>
<dd>
Opportunistic TLS. Use TLS if this is supported by the remote SMTP server, otherwise use plaintext. Since sending in the clear is acceptable, demanding stronger than default TLS security merely reduces inter-operability. The "smtp_tls_ciphers" and "smtp_tls_protocols" (Postfix &gt;= 2.6) configuration parameters provide control over the protocols and cipher grade used with opportunistic TLS.  With earlier releases the opportunistic TLS cipher grade is always "export" and no protocols are disabled. When TLS handshakes fail, the connection is retried with TLS disabled. This allows mail delivery to sites with non-interoperable TLS implementations.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>encrypt</b></dt>
<dd>
Mandatory TLS encryption. Since a minimum level of security is intended, it is reasonable to be specific about sufficiently secure protocol versions and ciphers. At this security level and higher, the main.cf parameters smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols and smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers specify the TLS protocols and minimum cipher grade which the administrator considers secure enough for mandatory encrypted sessions. This security level is not an appropriate default for systems delivering mail to the Internet.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>dane</b></dt>
<dd>
Opportunistic DANE TLS.  At this security level, the TLS policy for the destination is obtained via DNSSEC.  For TLSA policy to be in effect, the destination domain's containing DNS zone must be signed and the Postfix SMTP client's operating system must be configured to send its DNS queries to a recursive DNS nameserver that is able to validate the signed records.  Each MX host's DNS zone should also be signed, and should publish DANE TLSA (RFC 6698) records that specify how that MX host's TLS certificate is to be verified.  TLSA records do not preempt the normal SMTP MX host selection algorithm, if some MX hosts support TLSA and others do not, TLS security will vary from delivery to delivery.  It is up to the domain owner to configure their MX hosts and their DNS sensibly.  To configure the Postfix SMTP client for DNSSEC lookups see the documentation for the smtp_dns_support_level main.cf parameter.  When DNSSEC-validated TLSA records are not found the effective tls security level is "may".  When TLSA records are found, but are all unusable the effective security level is "encrypt".  For purposes of protocol and cipher selection, the "dane" security level is treated like a "mandatory" TLS security level, and weak ciphers and protocols are disabled.  Since DANE authenticates server certificates the "aNULL" cipher-suites are transparently excluded at this level, no need to configure this manually.  RFC 6698 (DANE) TLS authentication is available with Postfix 2.11 and later.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>dane-only</b></dt>
<dd>
Mandatory DANE TLS.  This is just like "dane" above, but DANE TLSA authentication is required.  There is no fallback to "may" or "encrypt" when TLSA records are missing or unusable.  RFC 6698 (DANE) TLS authentication is available with Postfix 2.11 and later.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>fingerprint</b></dt>
<dd>
Certificate fingerprint verification. At this security level, there are no trusted certificate authorities. The certificate trust chain, expiration date, etc., are not checked. Instead, the  <b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_cert_match</b> parameter lists the certificate fingerprint or public key fingerprint (Postfix 2.9 and later) of the valid server certificate. The digest algorithm used to calculate the fingerprint is selected by the  <b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest</b> parameter. Available with Postfix 2.5 and later.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>verify</b></dt>
<dd>
Mandatory TLS verification. At this security level, DNS MX lookups are trusted to be secure enough, and the name verified in the server certificate is usually obtained indirectly via unauthenticated DNS MX lookups. The smtp_tls_verify_cert_match parameter controls how the server name is verified. In practice explicit control over matching is more common at the "secure" level, described below. This security level is not an appropriate default for systems delivering mail to the Internet.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>secure</b></dt>
<dd>
Secure-channel TLS.  At this security level, DNS MX lookups, though potentially used to determine the candidate next-hop gateway IP addresses, are  <b>not</b> trusted to be secure enough for TLS peername verification. Instead, the default name verified in the server certificate is obtained from the next-hop domain as specified in the smtp_tls_secure_cert_match configuration parameter. The default matching rule is that a server certificate matches when its name is equal to or is a sub-domain of the nexthop domain. This security level is not an appropriate default for systems delivering mail to the Internet.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

<h1>smtp_tls_session_cache_database (default: empty)</h1> Name of the file containing the optional Postfix SMTP client TLS session cache. Specify a database type that supports enumeration, such as  <b>btree</b> or <b>sdbm</b>; there is no need to support concurrent access.  The file is created if it does not exist. The  <b>smtp</b>(8) daemon does not use this parameter directly, rather the cache is implemented indirectly in the  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8) daemon. This means that per-smtp-instance master.cf overrides of this parameter are not effective. Note, that each of the cache databases supported by  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8) daemon: $smtpd_tls_session_cache_database, $smtp_tls_session_cache_database (and with Postfix 2.3 and later $lmtp_tls_session_cache_database), needs to be stored separately. It is not at this time possible to store multiple caches in a single database.<p>
Note: <b>dbm</b> databases are not suitable. TLS session objects are too large.<p>
As of version 2.5, Postfix no longer uses root privileges when opening this file. The file should now be stored under the Postfix-owned data_directory. As a migration aid, an attempt to open the file under a non-Postfix directory is redirected to the Postfix-owned data_directory, and a warning is logged.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:/var/db/postfix/smtp_scache<br>

A cache cleanup is performed periodically every $smtp_tls_session_cache_timeout seconds. As with $smtp_tls_session_cache_database, this parameter is implemented in the  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8) daemon and therefore per-smtp-instance master.cf overrides are not possible.<p>
As of Postfix 2.11 this setting cannot exceed 100 days.  If set &lt;= 0, session caching is disabled.  If set to a positive value less than 2 minutes, the minimum value of 2 minutes is used instead.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtp_tls_trust_anchor_file (default: empty)</h1> Zero or more PEM-format files with trust-anchor certificates and/or public keys.  If the parameter is not empty the root CAs in CAfile and CApath are no longer trusted.  Rather, the Postfix SMTP client will only trust certificate-chains signed by one of the trust-anchors contained in the chosen files.  The specified trust-anchor certificates and public keys are not subject to expiration, and need not be (self-signed) root CAs.  They may, if desired, be intermediate certificates. Therefore, these certificates also may be found "in the middle" of the trust chain presented by the remote SMTP server, and any untrusted issuing parent certificates will be ignored.  Specify a list of pathnames separated by comma or whitespace.<p>
Whether specified in main.cf, or on a per-destination basis, the trust-anchor PEM file must be accessible to the Postfix SMTP client in the chroot jail if applicable.  The trust-anchor file should contain only certificates and public keys, no private key material, and must be readable by the non-privileged $mail_owner user.  This allows destinations to be bound to a set of specific CAs or public keys without trusting the same CAs for all destinations.<p>
The main.cf parameter supports single-purpose Postfix installations that send mail to a fixed set of SMTP peers.  At most sites, if trust-anchor files are used at all, they will be specified on a per-destination basis via the "tafile" attribute of the "verify" and "secure" levels in smtp_tls_policy_maps.<p>
The underlying mechanism is in support of RFC 6698 (DANE TLSA), which defines mechanisms for a client to securely determine server TLS certificates via DNS.<p>
If you want your trust anchors to be public keys, with OpenSSL you can extract a single PEM public key from a PEM X.509 file containing a single certificate, as follows:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h1>smtp_tls_verify_cert_match (default: hostname)</h1> How the Postfix SMTP client verifies the server certificate peername for the "verify" TLS security level. In a "verify" TLS policy table ($smtp_tls_policy_maps) entry the optional "match" attribute overrides this main.cf setting.<p>
This parameter specifies one or more patterns or strategies separated by commas, whitespace or colons.  In the policy table the only valid separator is the colon character.<p>

Strategies specify a transformation from the next-hop domain to the expected name in the server certificate:<dl>
<dt>
nexthop</dt>
<dd>
Match against the next-hop domain, which is either the recipient domain, or the transport next-hop configured for the domain stripped of any optional socket type prefix, enclosing square brackets and trailing port. When MX lookups are not suppressed, this is the original nexthop domain prior to the MX lookup, not the result of the MX lookup. For LMTP delivery via UNIX-domain sockets, the verified next-hop name is $myhostname.  This strategy is suitable for use with the "secure" policy. Case is ignored.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>

<dl>
<dt>
hostname</dt>
<dd>
Match against the hostname of the server, often obtained via an unauthenticated DNS MX lookup. For LMTP delivery via UNIX-domain sockets, the verified name is $myhostname. This matches the verification strategy of the "MUST" keyword in the obsolete smtp_tls_per_site table, and is suitable for use with the "verify" security level. When the next-hop name is enclosed in square brackets to suppress MX lookups, the "hostname" strategy is the same as the "nexthop" strategy. Case is ignored.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

&#160;</div>
Note: this restriction can only work reliably when used in smtpd_data_restrictions or smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions, because the total number of recipients is not known at an earlier stage of the SMTP conversation. Use at the RCPT stage will only reject the second etc.  recipient.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

Reject the request when the client sends SMTP commands ahead of time where it is not allowed, or when the client sends SMTP commands ahead of time without knowing that Postfix actually supports ESMTP command pipelining. This stops mail from bulk mail software that improperly uses ESMTP command pipelining in order to speed up deliveries.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With Postfix 2.6 and later, the SMTP server sets a per-session flag whenever it detects illegal pipelining, including pipelined EHLO or HELO commands. The reject_unauth_pipelining feature simply tests whether the flag was set at any point in time during the session.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

A safety net for testing. When "warn_if_reject" is placed before a reject-type restriction, access table query, or check_policy_service query, this logs a "reject_warning" message instead of rejecting a request (when a reject-type restriction fails due to a temporary error, this logs a "reject_warning" message for any implicit "defer_if_permit" actions that would normally prevent mail from being accepted by some later access restriction).

<h1>smtpd_command_filter (default: empty)</h1> A mechanism to transform commands from remote SMTP clients.

<h1>smtpd_delay_reject (default: yes)</h1> Wait until the RCPT TO command before evaluating $smtpd_client_restrictions, $smtpd_helo_restrictions and $smtpd_sender_restrictions, or wait until the ETRN command before evaluating $smtpd_client_restrictions and $smtpd_helo_restrictions.<p>
This feature is turned on by default because some clients apparently mis-behave when the Postfix SMTP server rejects commands before RCPT TO.<p>
The default setting has one major benefit: it allows Postfix to log recipient address information when rejecting a client name/address or sender address, so that it is possible to find out whose mail is being rejected.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps (default: empty)</h1> Lookup tables, indexed by the remote SMTP client address, with case insensitive lists of EHLO keywords (pipelining, starttls, auth, etc.) that the Postfix SMTP server will not send in the EHLO response to a remote SMTP client. See smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords for details. The table is not searched by hostname for robustness reasons.<p>

Note 1: "smtpd_enforce_tls = yes" implies "smtpd_tls_auth_only = yes".<p>
Note 2: when invoked via "<b>sendmail -bs</b>", Postfix will never offer STARTTLS due to insufficient privileges to access the server private key. This is intended behavior.<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_junk_command_limit (default: normal: 100, overload: 1)</h1> The number of junk commands (NOOP, VRFY, ETRN or RSET) that a remote SMTP client can send before the Postfix SMTP server starts to increment the error counter with each junk command.  The junk command count is reset after mail is delivered.  See also the smtpd_error_sleep_time and smtpd_soft_error_limit configuration parameters.  Normally the default limit is 100, but it changes under overload to just 1. With Postfix 2.5 and earlier, the SMTP server always allows up to 100 junk commands by default.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_log_access_permit_actions (default: empty)</h1> Enable logging of the named "permit" actions in SMTP server access lists (by default, the SMTP server logs "reject" actions but not "permit" actions).  This feature does not affect conditional actions such as "defer_if_permit".<p>
Specify a list of "permit" action names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The list is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match. A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name matches a lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a name from the list.<p>

<h1>smtpd_null_access_lookup_key (default: &lt;&gt;)</h1> The lookup key to be used in SMTP  <b>access</b>(5) tables instead of the null sender address.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_peername_lookup (default: yes)</h1> Attempt to look up the remote SMTP client hostname, and verify that the name matches the client IP address. A client name is set to "unknown" when it cannot be looked up or verified, or when name lookup is disabled.  Turning off name lookup reduces delays due to DNS lookup and increases the maximal inbound delivery rate.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_per_record_deadline (default: normal: no, overload: yes)</h1> Change the behavior of the smtpd_timeout and smtpd_starttls_timeout time limits, from a time limit per read or write system call, to a time limit to send or receive a complete record (an SMTP command line, SMTP response line, SMTP message content line, or TLS protocol message).  This limits the impact from hostile peers that trickle data one byte at a time.<p>
Note: when per-record deadlines are enabled, a short timeout may cause problems with TLS over very slow network connections. The reasons are that a TLS protocol message can be up to 16 kbytes long (with TLSv1), and that an entire TLS protocol message must be sent or received within the per-record deadline.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later. With older Postfix releases, the behavior is as if this parameter is set to "no".</div>

<h1>smtpd_proxy_ehlo (default: $myhostname)</h1> How the Postfix SMTP server announces itself to the proxy filter. By default, the Postfix hostname is used.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_proxy_filter (default: empty)</h1> The hostname and TCP port of the mail filtering proxy server. The proxy receives all mail from the Postfix SMTP server, and is supposed to give the result to another Postfix SMTP server process.<p>
Specify "host:port" or "inet:host:port" for a TCP endpoint, or "unix:pathname" for a UNIX-domain endpoint. The host can be specified as an IP address or as a symbolic name; no MX lookups are done. When no "host" or "host:"  are specified, the local machine is assumed.  Pathname interpretation is relative to the Postfix queue directory.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.<p>
The "inet:" and "unix:" prefixes are available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">

<h1>smtpd_recipient_overshoot_limit (default: 1000)</h1> The number of recipients that a remote SMTP client can send in excess of the limit specified with $smtpd_recipient_limit, before the Postfix SMTP server increments the per-session error count for each excess recipient.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_recipient_restrictions (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> Optional restrictions that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of a client RCPT TO command, after smtpd_relay_restrictions. See SMTPD_ACCESS_README, section "Delayed evaluation of SMTP access restriction lists" for a discussion of evaluation context and time.<p>
With Postfix versions before 2.10, the rules for relay permission and spam blocking were combined under smtpd_recipient_restrictions, resulting in error-prone configuration.  As of Postfix 2.10, relay permission rules are preferably implemented with smtpd_relay_restrictions, so that a permissive spam blocking policy under smtpd_recipient_restrictions will no longer result in a permissive mail relay policy.<p>
For backwards compatibility, sites that migrate from Postfix versions before 2.10 can set smtpd_relay_restrictions to the empty value, and use smtpd_recipient_restrictions exactly as before.<p>
IMPORTANT: Either the smtpd_relay_restrictions or the smtpd_recipient_restrictions parameter must specify at least one of the following restrictions. Otherwise Postfix will refuse to receive mail:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Note: the above text is meant to make it easier to find the Postfix logfile records for a failed SMTP session. The text itself is not logged to the Postfix SMTP server's maillog file.<p>
Be sure to keep the text as short as possible. Long text may be truncated before it is logged to the remote SMTP client's maillog file, or before it is returned to the sender in a delivery status notification.<p>

This feature supports the two-character sequence &#92;n as a request for a line break in the footer text. Postfix automatically inserts after each line break the three-digit SMTP reply code (and optional enhanced status code) from the original Postfix reject message.<p>
To work around mail software that mis-handles multi-line replies, specify the two-character sequence &#92;c at the start of the template. This suppresses the line break between the reply text and the footer text (Postfix 2.10 and later).<p>

<h1>smtpd_relay_restrictions (default: permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, defer_unauth_destination)</h1> Access restrictions for mail relay control that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of the RCPT TO command, before smtpd_recipient_restrictions. See SMTPD_ACCESS_README, section "Delayed evaluation of SMTP access restriction lists" for a discussion of evaluation context and time.<p>
With Postfix versions before 2.10, the rules for relay permission and spam blocking were combined under smtpd_recipient_restrictions, resulting in error-prone configuration.  As of Postfix 2.10, relay permission rules are preferably implemented with smtpd_relay_restrictions, so that a permissive spam blocking policy under smtpd_recipient_restrictions will no longer result in a permissive mail relay policy.<p>
For backwards compatibility, sites that migrate from Postfix versions before 2.10 can set smtpd_relay_restrictions to the empty value, and use smtpd_recipient_restrictions exactly as before.<p>
By default, the Postfix SMTP server accepts:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Mail from clients whose IP address matches $mynetworks, or:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>

<h1>smtpd_sasl_exceptions_networks (default: empty)</h1> What remote SMTP clients the Postfix SMTP server will not offer AUTH support to.<p>
Some clients (Netscape 4 at least) have a bug that causes them to require a login and password whenever AUTH is offered, whether it's necessary or not. To work around this, specify, for example, $mynetworks to prevent Postfix from offering AUTH to local clients.<p>
Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies the number of bits in the network part of a host address. You can also "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns.  A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.<p>
Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in the smtpd_sasl_exceptions_networks value, and in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":" character, and would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.<p>

By default, the Postfix SMTP server accepts plaintext passwords but not anonymous logins.<p>
Warning: it appears that clients try authentication methods in the order as advertised by the server (e.g., PLAIN ANONYMOUS CRAM-MD5) which means that if you disable plaintext passwords, clients will log in anonymously, even when they should be able to use CRAM-MD5. So, if you disable plaintext logins, disable anonymous logins too. Postfix treats anonymous login as no authentication.<p>

Normally the default limit is 300s, but it changes under overload to just 10s. With Postfix 2.5 and earlier, the SMTP server always uses a time limit of 300s by default.<p>
Note: if you set SMTP time limits to very large values you may have to update the global ipc_timeout parameter.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_CAfile (default: empty)</h1> A file containing (PEM format) CA certificates of root CAs trusted to sign either remote SMTP client certificates or intermediate CA certificates.  These are loaded into memory before the  <b>smtpd</b>(8) server enters the chroot jail. If the number of trusted roots is large, consider using smtpd_tls_CApath instead, but note that the latter directory must be present in the chroot jail if the  <b>smtpd</b>(8) server is chrooted. This file may also be used to augment the server certificate trust chain, but it is best to include all the required certificates directly in the server certificate file.<p>
Specify "smtpd_tls_CAfile = /path/to/system_CA_file" to use ONLY the system-supplied default certificate authority certificates.<p>
Specify "tls_append_default_CA = no" to prevent Postfix from appending the system-supplied default CAs and trusting third-party certificates.<p>
By default (see smtpd_tls_ask_ccert), client certificates are not requested, and smtpd_tls_CAfile should remain empty. If you do make use of client certificates, the distinguished names (DNs) of the certificate authorities listed in smtpd_tls_CAfile are sent to the remote SMTP client in the client certificate request message. MUAs with multiple client certificates may use the list of preferred certificate authorities to select the correct client certificate.  You may want to put your "preferred" CA or CAs in this file, and install other trusted CAs in $smtpd_tls_CApath.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
smtpd_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/CAcert.pem<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_CApath (default: empty)</h1> A directory containing (PEM format) CA certificates of root CAs trusted to sign either remote SMTP client certificates or intermediate CA certificates. Do not forget to create the necessary "hash" links with, for example, "$OPENSSL_HOME/bin/c_rehash /etc/postfix/certs". To use smtpd_tls_CApath in chroot mode, this directory (or a copy) must be inside the chroot jail.<p>
Specify "smtpd_tls_CApath = /path/to/system_CA_directory" to use ONLY the system-supplied default certificate authority certificates.<p>
Specify "tls_append_default_CA = no" to prevent Postfix from appending the system-supplied default CAs and trusting third-party certificates.<p>
By default (see smtpd_tls_ask_ccert), client certificates are not requested, and smtpd_tls_CApath should remain empty. In contrast to smtpd_tls_CAfile, DNs of certificate authorities installed in $smtpd_tls_CApath are not included in the client certificate request message. MUAs with multiple client certificates may use the list of preferred certificate authorities to select the correct client certificate.  You may want to put your "preferred" CA or CAs in $smtpd_tls_CAfile, and install the remaining trusted CAs in $smtpd_tls_CApath.<p>

<h1>smtpd_tls_always_issue_session_ids (default: yes)</h1> Force the Postfix SMTP server to issue a TLS session id, even when TLS session caching is turned off (smtpd_tls_session_cache_database is empty). This behavior is compatible with Postfix &lt; 2.3.<p>
With Postfix 2.3 and later the Postfix SMTP server can disable session id generation when TLS session caching is turned off. This keeps remote SMTP clients from caching sessions that almost certainly cannot be re-used.<p>
By default, the Postfix SMTP server always generates TLS session ids. This works around a known defect in mail client applications such as MS Outlook, and may also prevent interoperability issues with other MTAs.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
smtpd_tls_always_issue_session_ids = no<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_ask_ccert (default: no)</h1> Ask a remote SMTP client for a client certificate. This information is needed for certificate based mail relaying with, for example, the permit_tls_clientcerts feature.<p>
Some clients such as Netscape will either complain if no certificate is available (for the list of CAs in $smtpd_tls_CAfile) or will offer multiple client certificates to choose from. This may be annoying, so this option is "off" by default.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_auth_only (default: no)</h1> When TLS encryption is optional in the Postfix SMTP server, do not announce or accept SASL authentication over unencrypted connections.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_ccert_verifydepth (default: 9)</h1> The verification depth for remote SMTP client certificates. A depth of 1 is sufficient if the issuing CA is listed in a local CA file.<p>
The default verification depth is 9 (the OpenSSL default) for compatibility with earlier Postfix behavior. Prior to Postfix 2.5, the default value was 5, but the limit was not actually enforced. If you have set this to a lower non-default value, certificates with longer trust chains may now fail to verify. Certificate chains with 1 or 2 CAs are common, deeper chains are more rare and any number between 5 and 9 should suffice in practice. You can choose a lower number if, for example, you trust certificates directly signed by an issuing CA but not any CAs it delegates to.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_cert_file (default: empty)</h1> File with the Postfix SMTP server RSA certificate in PEM format. This file may also contain the Postfix SMTP server private RSA key.<p>
Public Internet MX hosts without certificates signed by a "reputable" CA must generate, and be prepared to present to most clients, a self-signed or private-CA signed certificate. The client will not be able to authenticate the server, but unless it is running Postfix 2.3 or similar software, it will still insist on a server certificate.<p>
For servers that are <b>not</b> public Internet MX hosts, Postfix 2.3 supports configurations with no certificates. This entails the use of just the anonymous TLS ciphers, which are not supported by typical SMTP clients. Since such clients will not, as a rule, fall back to plain text after a TLS handshake failure, the server will be unable to receive email from TLS enabled clients. To avoid accidental configurations with no certificates, Postfix 2.3 enables certificate-less operation only when the administrator explicitly sets "smtpd_tls_cert_file = none". This ensures that new Postfix configurations will not accidentally run with no certificates.<p>
Both RSA and DSA certificates are supported.  When both types are present, the cipher used determines which certificate will be presented to the client.  For Netscape and OpenSSL clients without special cipher choices the RSA certificate is preferred.<p>
To enable a remote SMTP client to verify the Postfix SMTP server certificate, the issuing CA certificates must be made available to the client. You should include the required certificates in the server certificate file, the server certificate first, then the issuing CA(s) (bottom-up order).<p>
Example: the certificate for "server.example.com" was issued by "intermediate CA" which itself has a certificate of "root CA". Create the server.pem file with "cat server_cert.pem intermediate_CA.pem root_CA.pem &gt; server.pem".<p>
If you also want to verify client certificates issued by these CAs, you can add the CA certificates to the smtpd_tls_CAfile, in which case it is not necessary to have them in the smtpd_tls_cert_file or smtpd_tls_dcert_file.<p>
A certificate supplied here must be usable as an SSL server certificate and hence pass the "openssl verify -purpose sslserver ..." test.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/server.pem<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_cipherlist (default: empty)</h1> Obsolete Postfix &lt; 2.3 control for the Postfix SMTP server TLS cipher list. It is easy to create inter-operability problems by choosing a non-default cipher list. Do not use a non-default TLS cipherlist for MX hosts on the public Internet. Clients that begin the TLS handshake, but are unable to agree on a common cipher, may not be able to send any email to the SMTP server. Using a restricted cipher list may be more appropriate for a dedicated MSA or an internal mailhub, where one can exert some control over the TLS software and settings of the connecting clients.<p>
<b>Note:</b> do not use "" quotes around the parameter value.<p>
This feature is available with Postfix version 2.2. It is not used with Postfix 2.3 and later; use smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers instead.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_ciphers (default: export)</h1> The minimum TLS cipher grade that the Postfix SMTP server will use with opportunistic TLS encryption. Cipher types listed in smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers are excluded from the base definition of the selected cipher grade. The default value "export" ensures maximum inter-operability. Because encryption is optional, stronger controls are not appropriate, and this setting SHOULD NOT be changed unless the change is essential.<p>
When TLS is mandatory the cipher grade is chosen via the smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers configuration parameter, see there for syntax details.<p>
Example:<br>
smtpd_tls_ciphers = export<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later. With earlier Postfix releases only the smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers parameter is implemented, and opportunistic TLS always uses "export" or better (i.e. all) ciphers.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_dcert_file (default: empty)</h1> File with the Postfix SMTP server DSA certificate in PEM format. This file may also contain the Postfix SMTP server private DSA key.<p>

Example:<p>
<br>
smtpd_tls_dcert_file = /etc/postfix/server-dsa.pem<br>

<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file (default: empty)</h1> File with DH parameters that the Postfix SMTP server should use with non-export EDH ciphers.<p>
Instead of using the exact same parameter sets as distributed with other TLS packages, it is more secure to generate your own set of parameters with something like the following commands:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
openssl dhparam -out /etc/postfix/dh512.pem 512<br>
openssl dhparam -out /etc/postfix/dh1024.pem 1024<br>
openssl dhparam -out /etc/postfix/dh2048.pem 2048<br>
<br>
<p>
It is safe to share the same DH parameters between multiple Postfix instances.  If you prefer, you can generate separate parameters for each instance.<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers (default: empty)</h1> List of ciphers or cipher types to exclude from the SMTP server cipher list at all TLS security levels. Excluding valid ciphers can create interoperability problems. DO NOT exclude ciphers unless it is essential to do so. This is not an OpenSSL cipherlist; it is a simple list separated by whitespace and/or commas. The elements are a single cipher, or one or more "+" separated cipher properties, in which case only ciphers matching  <b>all</b> the properties are excluded.<p>
Examples (some of these will cause problems):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = aNULL<br>
smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = MD5, DES<br>
smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = DES+MD5<br>
smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = AES256-SHA, DES-CBC3-MD5<br>
smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = kEDH+aRSA<br>
<br>
<p>
The first setting disables anonymous ciphers. The next setting disables ciphers that use the MD5 digest algorithm or the (single) DES encryption algorithm. The next setting disables ciphers that use MD5 and DES together.  The next setting disables the two ciphers "AES256-SHA" and "DES-CBC3-MD5". The last setting disables ciphers that use "EDH" key exchange with RSA authentication.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_fingerprint_digest (default: md5)</h1> The message digest algorithm to construct remote SMTP client-certificate fingerprints or public key fingerprints (Postfix 2.9 and later) for  <b>check_ccert_access</b> and <b>permit_tls_clientcerts</b>. The default algorithm is  <b>md5</b>, for backwards compatibility with Postfix releases prior to 2.5.<p>
Advances in hash function cryptanalysis have led to md5 being deprecated in favor of sha1. However, as long as there are no known "second pre-image" attacks against md5, its use in this context can still be considered safe.<p>
While additional digest algorithms are often available with OpenSSL's libcrypto, only those used by libssl in SSL cipher suites are available to Postfix.<p>
To find the fingerprint of a specific certificate file, with a specific digest algorithm, run:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
$ openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -<i>digest</i> -in <i>certfile</i>.pem<br>
<br>
<p>
The text to the right of "=" sign is the desired fingerprint. For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
$ openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -in cert.pem<br>
SHA1 Fingerprint=D4:6A:AB:19:24:79:F8:32:BB:A6:CB:66:82:C0:8E:9B:EE:29:A8:1A<br>
<br>
<p>
To extract the public key fingerprint from an X.509 certificate, you need to extract the public key from the certificate and compute the appropriate digest of its DER (ASN.1) encoding. With OpenSSL the "-pubkey" option of the "x509" command extracts the public key always in "PEM" format. We pipe the result to another OpenSSL command that converts the key to DER and then to the "dgst" command to compute the fingerprint.<p>
The actual command to transform the key to DER format depends on the version of OpenSSL used. With OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later, the "pkey" command supports all key types. With OpenSSL 0.9.8 and earlier, the key type is always RSA (nobody uses DSA, and EC keys are not fully supported by 0.9.8), so the "rsa" command is used.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The default grade ("medium") is sufficiently strong that any benefit from globally restricting TLS sessions to a more stringent grade is likely negligible, especially given the fact that many implementations still do not offer any stronger ("high" grade) ciphers, while those that do, will always use "high" grade ciphers. So insisting on "high" grade ciphers is generally counter-productive. Allowing "export" or "low" ciphers is typically not a good idea, as systems limited to just these are limited to obsolete browsers. No known SMTP clients fail to support at least one "medium" or "high" grade cipher.<p>
The following cipher grades are supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>export</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable "EXPORT" grade or stronger OpenSSL ciphers. This is the most appropriate setting for public MX hosts, and is always used with opportunistic TLS encryption. The underlying cipherlist is specified via the tls_export_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged to not change.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>low</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable "LOW" grade or stronger OpenSSL ciphers. The underlying cipherlist is specified via the tls_low_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged to not change.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>medium</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable "MEDIUM" grade or stronger OpenSSL ciphers. These use 128-bit or longer symmetric bulk-encryption keys. This is the default minimum strength for mandatory TLS encryption. The underlying cipherlist is specified via the tls_medium_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged to not change.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>high</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable only "HIGH" grade OpenSSL ciphers. The underlying cipherlist is specified via the tls_high_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged to not change.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>null</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable only the "NULL" OpenSSL ciphers, these provide authentication without encryption.  This setting is only appropriate in the rare case that all clients are prepared to use NULL ciphers (not normally enabled in TLS clients). The underlying cipherlist is specified via the tls_null_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged to not change.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

<p>
Cipher types listed in smtpd_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers or smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers are excluded from the base definition of the selected cipher grade. See smtpd_tls_ciphers for cipher controls that apply to opportunistic TLS.<p>
The underlying cipherlists for grades other than "null" include anonymous ciphers, but these are automatically filtered out if the server is configured to ask for remote SMTP client certificates.  You are very unlikely to need to take any steps to exclude anonymous ciphers, they are excluded automatically as required.  If you must exclude anonymous ciphers even when Postfix does not need or use peer certificates, set "smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = aNULL". To exclude anonymous ciphers only when TLS is enforced, set "smtpd_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers = aNULL".<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers (default: empty)</h1> Additional list of ciphers or cipher types to exclude from the Postfix SMTP server cipher list at mandatory TLS security levels. This list works in addition to the exclusions listed with smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers (see there for syntax details).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols (default: !SSLv2)</h1> The SSL/TLS protocols accepted by the Postfix SMTP server with mandatory TLS encryption. If the list is empty, the server supports all available SSL/TLS protocol versions.  A non-empty value is a list of protocol names separated by whitespace, commas or colons. The supported protocol names are "SSLv2", "SSLv3" and "TLSv1", and are not case sensitive.<p>
With Postfix &gt;= 2.5 the parameter syntax was expanded to support protocol exclusions. One can explicitly exclude "SSLv2" by setting "smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2". To exclude both "SSLv2" and "SSLv3" set "smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3". Listing the protocols to include, rather than protocols to exclude, is supported, but not recommended. The exclusion form more closely matches the underlying OpenSSL interface semantics.<p>
Note: As of OpenSSL 1.0.1 two new protocols are defined, "TLSv1.1" and "TLSv1.2". When Postfix &lt;= 2.5 is linked against OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later, these, or any other new protocol versions, cannot be disabled.  The latest patch levels of Postfix &gt;= 2.6, and all versions of Postfix &gt;= 2.10 can disable support for "TLSv1.1" or "TLSv1.2".<p>
Since SSL version 2 has known protocol weaknesses and is now deprecated, the default setting excludes "SSLv2".  This means that by default, SSL version 2 will not be used at the "encrypt" security level.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
# Preferred syntax with Postfix &gt;= 2.5:<br>
smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3<br>
# Legacy syntax:<br>
smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = TLSv1<br>

<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_protocols (default: empty)</h1> List of TLS protocols that the Postfix SMTP server will exclude or include with opportunistic TLS encryption. This parameter SHOULD be left at its default empty value, allowing all protocols to be used with opportunistic TLS.  A non-empty value is a list of protocol names separated by whitespace, commas or colons.  The supported protocol names are "SSLv2", "SSLv3" and "TLSv1", and are not case sensitive.<p>
Note: As of OpenSSL 1.0.1 two new protocols are defined, "TLSv1.1" and "TLSv1.2". The latest patch levels of Postfix &gt;= 2.6, and all versions of Postfix &gt;= 2.10 can disable support for "TLSv1.1" or "TLSv1.2".<p>
To include a protocol list its name, to exclude it, prefix the name with a "!" character. To exclude SSLv2 even for opportunistic TLS set "smtpd_tls_protocols = !SSLv2". To exclude both "SSLv2" and "SSLv3" set "smtpd_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3". Explicitly listing the protocols to include, rather than protocols to exclude, is supported, but not recommended.  The exclusion form more closely matches the underlying OpenSSL interface semantics.<p>

<h1>smtpd_tls_received_header (default: no)</h1> Request that the Postfix SMTP server produces Received:  message headers that include information about the protocol and cipher used, as well as the remote SMTP client CommonName and client certificate issuer CommonName.  This is disabled by default, as the information may be modified in transit through other mail servers.  Only information that was recorded by the final destination can be trusted.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_req_ccert (default: no)</h1> With mandatory TLS encryption, require a trusted remote SMTP client certificate in order to allow TLS connections to proceed.  This option implies "smtpd_tls_ask_ccert = yes".<p>
When TLS encryption is optional, this setting is ignored with a warning written to the mail log.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_security_level (default: empty)</h1> The SMTP TLS security level for the Postfix SMTP server; when a non-empty value is specified, this overrides the obsolete parameters smtpd_use_tls and smtpd_enforce_tls. This parameter is ignored with "smtpd_tls_wrappermode = yes".<p>
Specify one of the following security levels:<dl>

Mandatory TLS encryption: announce STARTTLS support to remote SMTP clients, and require that clients use TLS encryption.

Note 1: the "fingerprint", "verify" and "secure" levels are not supported here. The Postfix SMTP server logs a warning and uses "encrypt" instead. To verify remote SMTP client certificates, see TLS_README for a discussion of the smtpd_tls_ask_ccert, smtpd_tls_req_ccert, and permit_tls_clientcerts features.<p>
Note 2: The parameter setting "smtpd_tls_security_level = encrypt" implies "smtpd_tls_auth_only = yes".<p>
Note 3: when invoked via "sendmail -bs", Postfix will never offer STARTTLS due to insufficient privileges to access the server private key. This is intended behavior.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_session_cache_database (default: empty)</h1> Name of the file containing the optional Postfix SMTP server TLS session cache. Specify a database type that supports enumeration, such as  <b>btree</b> or <b>sdbm</b>; there is no need to support concurrent access.  The file is created if it does not exist. The  <b>smtpd</b>(8) daemon does not use this parameter directly, rather the cache is implemented indirectly in the  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8) daemon. This means that per-smtpd-instance master.cf overrides of this parameter are not effective. Note, that each of the cache databases supported by  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8) daemon: $smtpd_tls_session_cache_database, $smtp_tls_session_cache_database (and with Postfix 2.3 and later $lmtp_tls_session_cache_database), needs to be stored separately. It is not at this time possible to store multiple caches in a single database.<p>
Note: <b>dbm</b> databases are not suitable. TLS session objects are too large.<p>
As of version 2.5, Postfix no longer uses root privileges when opening this file. The file should now be stored under the Postfix-owned data_directory. As a migration aid, an attempt to open the file under a non-Postfix directory is redirected to the Postfix-owned data_directory, and a warning is logged.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
smtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:/var/db/postfix/smtpd_scache<br>
<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_session_cache_timeout (default: 3600s)</h1> The expiration time of Postfix SMTP server TLS session cache information. A cache cleanup is performed periodically every $smtpd_tls_session_cache_timeout seconds. As with $smtpd_tls_session_cache_database, this parameter is implemented in the  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8) daemon and therefore per-smtpd-instance master.cf overrides are not possible.<p>
As of Postfix 2.11 this setting cannot exceed 100 days.  If set &lt;= 0, session caching is disabled, not just via the database, but also via RFC 5077 TLS session tickets, which don't require server-side storage.  If set to a positive value less than 2 minutes, the minimum value of 2 minutes is used instead.  TLS session tickets require an OpenSSL library (at least version 0.9.8h) that provides full support for this TLS extension.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later, and updated for TLS session ticket support in Postfix 2.11.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_tls_wrappermode (default: no)</h1> Run the Postfix SMTP server in the non-standard "wrapper" mode, instead of using the STARTTLS command.<p>
If you want to support this service, enable a special port in master.cf, and specify "-o smtpd_tls_wrappermode=yes" on the SMTP server's command line. Port 465 (smtps) was once chosen for this purpose.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_upstream_proxy_protocol (default: empty)</h1> The name of the proxy protocol used by an optional before-smtpd proxy agent. When a proxy agent is used, this protocol conveys local and remote address and port information.  Specify "smtpd_upstream_proxy_protocol = haproxy" to enable the haproxy protocol.<p>
NOTE: To use the nginx proxy with <b>smtpd</b>(8), enable the XCLIENT protocol with smtpd_authorized_xclient_hosts. This supports SASL authentication in the proxy agent (Postfix 2.9 and later).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.10 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_upstream_proxy_timeout (default: 5s)</h1> The time limit for the proxy protocol specified with the smtpd_upstream_proxy_protocol parameter.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.10 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>smtpd_use_tls (default: no)</h1> Opportunistic TLS: announce STARTTLS support to remote SMTP clients, but do not require that clients use TLS encryption.<p>
Note: when invoked via "<b>sendmail -bs</b>", Postfix will never offer STARTTLS due to insufficient privileges to access the server private key. This is intended behavior.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later. With Postfix 2.3 and later use smtpd_tls_security_level instead.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>soft_bounce (default: no)</h1> Safety net to keep mail queued that would otherwise be returned to the sender.  This parameter disables locally-generated bounces, changes the handling of negative responses from remote servers, content filters or plugins, and prevents the Postfix SMTP server from rejecting mail permanently by changing 5xx reply codes into 4xx.  However, soft_bounce is no cure for address rewriting mistakes or mail routing mistakes.<p>
Note: "soft_bounce = yes" is in some cases implemented by modifying server responses. Therefore, the response that Postfix logs may differ from the response that Postfix actually sends or receives.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
soft_bounce = yes<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>stale_lock_time (default: 500s)</h1> The time after which a stale exclusive mailbox lockfile is removed. This is used for delivery to file or mailbox.<p>
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s (seconds).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>stress (default: empty)</h1> This feature is documented in the STRESS_README document.<p>

This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>strict_8bitmime (default: no)</h1> Enable both strict_7bit_headers and strict_8bitmime_body.<p>

This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>strict_8bitmime_body (default: no)</h1> Reject 8-bit message body text without 8-bit MIME content encoding information.  This blocks mail from poorly written applications.<p>
Unfortunately, this also rejects majordomo approval requests when the included request contains valid 8-bit MIME mail, and it rejects bounces from mailers that do not MIME encapsulate 8-bit content (for example, bounces from qmail or from old versions of Postfix).<p>
This feature should not be enabled on a general purpose mail server, because it is likely to reject legitimate email.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>strict_mailbox_ownership (default: yes)</h1> Defer delivery when a mailbox file is not owned by its recipient. The default setting is not backwards compatible.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.5.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>strict_mime_encoding_domain (default: no)</h1> Reject mail with invalid Content-Transfer-Encoding: information for the message/* or multipart/* MIME content types.  This blocks mail from poorly written software.<p>
This feature should not be enabled on a general purpose mail server, because it will reject mail after a single violation.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>strict_rfc821_envelopes (default: no)</h1> Require that addresses received in SMTP MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands are enclosed with &lt;&gt;, and that those addresses do not contain RFC 822 style comments or phrases.  This stops mail from poorly written software.<p>
By default, the Postfix SMTP server accepts RFC 822 syntax in MAIL FROM and RCPT TO addresses.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>sun_mailtool_compatibility (default: no)</h1> Obsolete SUN mailtool compatibility feature. Instead, use "mailbox_delivery_lock = dotlock".</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>swap_bangpath (default: yes)</h1> Enable the rewriting of "site!user" into "user@site".  This is necessary if your machine is connected to UUCP networks.  It is enabled by default.<p>
Note: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of the following conditions is true:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The message is received with the Postfix <b>sendmail</b>(1) command,</dd>

<div class="section">
<h1>syslog_facility (default: mail)</h1> The syslog facility of Postfix logging. Specify a facility as defined in syslog. <b>conf</b>(5). The default facility is "mail".<p>
Warning: a non-default syslog_facility setting takes effect only after a Postfix process has completed initialization.  Errors during process initialization will be logged with the default facility. Examples are errors while parsing the command line arguments, and errors while accessing the Postfix main.cf configuration file.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>syslog_name (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> The mail system name that is prepended to the process name in syslog records, so that "smtpd" becomes, for example, "postfix/smtpd".<p>
Warning: a non-default syslog_name setting takes effect only after a Postfix process has completed initialization. Errors during process initialization will be logged with the default name. Examples are errors while parsing the command line arguments, and errors while accessing the Postfix main.cf configuration file.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tcp_windowsize (default: 0)</h1> An optional workaround for routers that break TCP window scaling. Specify a value &gt; 0 and &lt; 65536 to enable this feature.  With Postfix TCP servers ( <b>smtpd</b>(8), <b>qmqpd</b>(8)), this feature is implemented by the Postfix  <b>master</b>(8) daemon.<p>
To change this parameter without stopping Postfix, you need to first terminate all Postfix TCP servers:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
# postconf -e master_service_disable=inet<br>
# postfix reload<br>

This immediately terminates all processes that accept network connections.  Next, you enable Postfix TCP servers with the updated tcp_windowsize setting:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
<br>
# postconf -e tcp_windowsize=65535 master_service_disable=<br>
# postfix reload<br>
<br>
<p>
If you skip these steps with a running Postfix system, then the tcp_windowsize change will work only for Postfix TCP clients ( <b>smtp</b>(8),  <b>lmtp</b>(8)).<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_append_default_CA (default: no)</h1> Append the system-supplied default certificate authority certificates to the ones specified with *_tls_CApath or *_tls_CAfile. The default is "no"; this prevents Postfix from trusting third-party certificates and giving them relay permission with permit_tls_all_clientcerts.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.4.15, 2.5.11, 2.6.8, 2.7.2 and later versions. Specify "tls_append_default_CA = yes" for backwards compatibility, to avoid breaking certificate verification with sites that don't use permit_tls_all_clientcerts.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_daemon_random_bytes (default: 32)</h1> The number of pseudo-random bytes that an  <b>smtp</b>(8) or <b>smtpd</b>(8) process requests from the  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8) server in order to seed its internal pseudo random number generator (PRNG).  The default of 32 bytes (equivalent to 256 bits) is sufficient to generate a 128bit (or 168bit) session key.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_dane_digest_agility (default: on)</h1> Configure DANE TLSA digest algorithm agility.  When digest algorithm agility is enabled, and the server and client support a common strong digest algorithm, TLSA records with weaker digest algorithms are ignored.<p>
Specify one of the following:<dl>
<dt>
<b>off</b></dt>
<dd>
DANE verification examines each well-formed record in the TLSA RRset whose matching type is either "0" (no hash used) or is one of the digest algorithms listed in $tls_dane_digests.  This setting is not recommended.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>on</b></dt>
<dd>
From each group of well-formed TLSA RRs a non-zero digest matching type with the same certificate usage and selector, DANE verification examines only those records whose matching type has the highest precedence (appear earliest in $tls_dane_digests).<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>maybe</b></dt>
<dd>
For compatibility with digest algorithm agility, each certificate or public key whose digest is included in a DANE TLSA RRset, SHOULD be published with the same set of digest matching type values as any other with the same usage and selector.  Therefore, compatible TLSA RRsets will contain an identical count of well-formed RRs with each non-zero digest matching type for any fixed combination of usage and selector.  When this constraint is violated, or any of the digest records are malformed, digest algorithm agility will disabled.  Otherwise, digest algorithm agility is enabled.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Digest algorithm agility ensures that the strongest digest supported by both the Postfix SMTP client and the remote server is used, and weaker digests are ignored.  This supports non-disruptive deprecation of outdated digest algorithms.<p>
To ensure compatibility with digest algorithm agility during key rotation, when a certificate or public key is being replaced with another, and both are published during the transition, both the old and the new certificate MUST be specified with the same set of digests.  One can change the list of digest algorithms later, once old keys are retired.  At any given time, change either the list of digests without changing the list of certificates or public keys or the list of certificates or public keys without changing the list of digests.  Full value matching type "0" records are not subject to this constraint, but are discouraged due to the size of the resulting DNS records.<p>
It is expected that this algorithm agility mechanism will be published in a standards track RFC for SMTP with DANE, and also in an eventual update to RFC 6698.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_dane_digests (default: sha512 sha256)</h1> RFC 6698 TLSA resource-record "matching type" digest algorithms in descending preference order.  All the specified algorithms must be supported by the underlying OpenSSL library, otherwise the Postfix SMTP client will not support DANE TLSA security.<p>
Specify a list of digest names separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Each digest name may be followed by an optional "=&lt;number&gt;" suffix.  For example, "sha512" may instead be specified as "sha512=2" and "sha256" may instead be specified as "sha256=1". The optional number must match the &lt;a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/dane-parameters/dane-parameters.xhtml#matching-types" &gt;IANA assigned TLSA matching type number the algorithm in question. Postfix will check this constraint for the algorithms it knows about. Additional matching type algorithms registered with IANA can be added with explicit numbers provided they are supported by OpenSSL.<p>
Invalid list elements are logged with a warning and disable DANE support.  TLSA RRs that specify digests not included in the list are ignored with a warning.<p>
Note: It is unwise to omit sha256 from the digest list.  This digest algorithm is the only mandatory to implement digest algorithm in RFC 6698, and many servers are expected publish TLSA records with just sha256 digests.  Unless one of the standard digests is seriously compromised and servers have had ample time to update their TLSA records you should not omit any standard digests, just arrange them in order from strongest to weakest.<p>
When for a particular combination of "certificate usage" and "selector" the TLSA RRset contains records with more than one digest matching type, the tls_dane_digest_agility parameter determines whether all the RRs are used, or only those with the most preferred digest matching type.<p>
The tls_dane_trust_anchor_digest_enable parameter controls whether any digest TLSA records are acceptable in usage "2" (trust anchor assertion) TLSA records.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_dane_trust_anchor_digest_enable (default: yes)</h1> RFC 6698 trust-anchor digest support in the Postfix TLS library. Enable support for RFC 6698 (DANE TLSA) DNS records that contain digests of trust-anchors with certificate usage "2".  In this case the certificate usage logically requires the server administrator to configure the server to include the trust-anchor certificate in the server's SSL certificate chain.  If enough domains mess this up, you can disable support for these TLSA records, but you'll no longer have secure connections that get it right and only publish trust anchor records.<p>
At the dane security level, when a TLSA RRset includes only unusable associations, the Postfix SMTP client will automatically switch the connection to the encrypt security level.  At the dane-only security level, the server in question is skipped and delivery is deferred if no secure servers are found.<p>
The tls_dane_digests parameter controls the list of digest algorithms that are supported in TLSA records.  The tls_dane_digest_agility parameter controls digest algorithm downgrade attack resistance.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_disable_workarounds (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> List or bit-mask of OpenSSL bug work-arounds to disable.<p>
The OpenSSL toolkit includes a set of work-arounds for buggy SSL/TLS implementations. Applications, such as Postfix, that want to maximize interoperability ask the OpenSSL library to enable the full set of recommended work-arounds.<p>
From time to time, it is discovered that a work-around creates a security issue, and should no longer be used. If upgrading OpenSSL to a fixed version is not an option or an upgrade is not available in a timely manner, or in closed environments where no buggy clients or servers exist, it may be appropriate to disable some or all of the OpenSSL interoperability work-arounds. This parameter specifies which bug work-arounds to disable.<p>
If the value of the parameter is a hexadecimal long integer starting with "0x", the bug work-arounds corresponding to the bits specified in its value are removed from the  <b>SSL_OP_ALL</b> work-around bit-mask (see openssl/ssl.h and SSL_CTX_ <b>set_options</b>(3)). You can specify more bits than are present in SSL_OP_ALL, excess bits are ignored. Specifying 0xFFFFFFFF disables all bug-workarounds on a 32-bit system. This should also be sufficient on 64-bit systems, until OpenSSL abandons support for 32-bit systems and starts using the high 32 bits of a 64-bit bug-workaround mask.<p>
Otherwise, the parameter is a white-space or comma separated list of specific named bug work-arounds chosen from the list below. It is possible that your OpenSSL version includes new bug work-arounds added after your Postfix source code was last updated, in that case you can only disable one of these via the hexadecimal syntax above.<dl>

<div class="section">
<h1>tls_eecdh_strong_curve (default: prime256v1)</h1> The elliptic curve used by the Postfix SMTP server for sensibly strong ephemeral ECDH key exchange. This curve is used by the Postfix SMTP server when "smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade = strong". The phrase "sensibly strong" means approximately 128-bit security based on best known attacks. The selected curve must be implemented by OpenSSL (as reported by  <b>ecparam</b>(1) with the "-list_curves" option) and be one of the curves listed in Section 5.1.1 of RFC 4492. You should not generally change this setting.  Remote SMTP client implementations must support this curve for EECDH key exchange to take place.  It is unwise to choose an "exotic" curve supported by only a small subset of clients.<p>
The default "strong" curve is rated in NSA Suite B for information classified up to SECRET.<p>
Note: elliptic curve names are poorly standardized; different standards groups are assigning different names to the same underlying curves.  The curve with the X9.62 name "prime256v1" is also known under the SECG name "secp256r1", but OpenSSL does not recognize the latter name.<p>
If you want to take maximal advantage of ciphers that offer forward secrecy see the Getting started section of FORWARD_SECRECY_README.  The full document conveniently presents all information about Postfix "perfect" forward secrecy support in one place: what forward secrecy is, how to tweak settings, and what you can expect to see when Postfix uses ciphers with forward secrecy.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later, when it is compiled and linked with OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later on platforms where EC algorithms have not been disabled by the vendor.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_eecdh_ultra_curve (default: secp384r1)</h1> The elliptic curve used by the Postfix SMTP server for maximally strong ephemeral ECDH key exchange. This curve is used by the Postfix SMTP server when "smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade = ultra". The phrase "maximally strong" means approximately 192-bit security based on best known attacks. This additional strength comes at a significant computational cost, most users should instead set "smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade = strong".  The selected curve must be implemented by OpenSSL (as reported by  <b>ecparam</b>(1) with the "-list_curves" option) and be one of the curves listed in Section 5.1.1 of RFC 4492.

<h1>tls_export_cipherlist (default: ALL:+RC4:@STRENGTH)</h1> The OpenSSL cipherlist for "EXPORT" or higher grade ciphers. This defines the meaning of the "export" setting in smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers, smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers. This is the cipherlist for the opportunistic ("may") TLS client security level and is the default cipherlist for the SMTP server. You are strongly encouraged to not change this setting. With OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later the cipherlist may start with an "aNULL:" prefix, which restores the 0.9.8-compatible ordering of the aNULL ciphers to the top of the list when they are enabled. This prefix is not needed with previous OpenSSL releases.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_high_cipherlist (default: ALL:!EXPORT:!LOW:!MEDIUM:+RC4:@STRENGTH)</h1> The OpenSSL cipherlist for "HIGH" grade ciphers. This defines the meaning of the "high" setting in smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers, smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers. You are strongly encouraged to not change this setting. With OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later the cipherlist may start with an "aNULL:" prefix, which restores the 0.9.8-compatible ordering of the aNULL ciphers to the top of the list when they are enabled.

<h1>tls_legacy_public_key_fingerprints (default: no)</h1> A temporary migration aid for sites that use certificate  <i>public-key</i> fingerprints with Postfix 2.9.0..2.9.5, which use an incorrect algorithm. This parameter has no effect on the certificate fingerprint support that is available since Postfix 2.2.<p>
Specify "tls_legacy_public_key_fingerprints = yes" temporarily, pending a migration from configuration files with incorrect Postfix 2.9.0..2.9.5 certificate public-key finger prints, to the correct fingerprints used by Postfix 2.9.6 and later.  To compute the correct certificate public-key fingerprints, see TLS_README.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.9.6 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_low_cipherlist (default: ALL:!EXPORT:+RC4:@STRENGTH)</h1> The OpenSSL cipherlist for "LOW" or higher grade ciphers. This defines the meaning of the "low" setting in smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers, smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers. You are strongly encouraged to not change this setting.  With OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later the cipherlist may start with an "aNULL:" prefix, which restores the 0.9.8-compatible ordering of the aNULL ciphers to the top of the list when they are enabled. This prefix is not needed with previous OpenSSL releases.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_medium_cipherlist (default: ALL:!EXPORT:!LOW:+RC4:@STRENGTH)</h1> The OpenSSL cipherlist for "MEDIUM" or higher grade ciphers. This defines the meaning of the "medium" setting in smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers, smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers. This is the default cipherlist for mandatory TLS encryption in the TLS client (with anonymous ciphers disabled when verifying server certificates). You are strongly encouraged to not change this setting.

This defines the meaning of the "null" setting in smtpd_mandatory_tls_ciphers, smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers.  You are strongly encouraged to not change this setting.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_preempt_cipherlist (default: no)</h1> With SSLv3 and later, use the Postfix SMTP server's cipher preference order instead of the remote client's cipher preference order.<p>
By default, the OpenSSL server selects the client's most preferred cipher that the server supports. With SSLv3 and later, the server may choose its own most preferred cipher that is supported (offered) by the client. Setting "tls_preempt_cipherlist = yes" enables server cipher preferences.<p>
While server cipher selection may in some cases lead to a more secure or performant cipher choice, there is some risk of interoperability issues. In the past, some SSL clients have listed lower priority ciphers that they did not implement correctly. If the server chooses a cipher that the client prefers less, it may select a cipher whose client implementation is flawed. Most notably Windows 2003 Microsoft Exchange servers have flawed implementations of DES-CBC3-SHA, which OpenSSL considers stronger than RC4-SHA.  Enabling server cipher-suite selection may create interoperability issues with Windows 2003 Microsoft Exchange clients.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later, in combination with OpenSSL 0.9.7 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_random_bytes (default: 32)</h1> The number of bytes that  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8) reads from $tls_random_source when (re)seeding the in-memory pseudo random number generator (PRNG) pool. The default of 32 bytes (256 bits) is good enough for 128bit symmetric keys.  If using EGD or a device file, a maximum of 255 bytes is read.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_random_exchange_name (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> Name of the pseudo random number generator (PRNG) state file that is maintained by  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8). The file is created when it does not exist, and its length is fixed at 1024 bytes.<p>
As of version 2.5, Postfix no longer uses root privileges when opening this file, and the default file location was changed from ${config_directory}/prng_exch to ${data_directory}/prng_exch.  As a migration aid, an attempt to open the file under a non-Postfix directory is redirected to the Postfix-owned data_directory, and a warning is logged.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_random_prng_update_period (default: 3600s)</h1> The time between attempts by  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8) to save the state of the pseudo random number generator (PRNG) to the file specified with $tls_random_exchange_name.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_random_reseed_period (default: 3600s)</h1> The maximal time between attempts by  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8) to re-seed the in-memory pseudo random number generator (PRNG) pool from external sources.  The actual time between re-seeding attempts is calculated using the PRNG, and is between 0 and the time specified.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_random_source (default: see postconf -d output)</h1> The external entropy source for the in-memory  <b>tlsmgr</b>(8) pseudo random number generator (PRNG) pool. Be sure to specify a non-blocking source.  If this source is not a regular file, the entropy source type must be prepended:  egd:/path/to/egd_socket for a source with EGD compatible socket interface, or dev:/path/to/device for a device file.<p>
Note: on OpenBSD systems specify /dev/arandom when /dev/urandom gives timeout errors.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>tls_ssl_options (default: empty)</h1> List or bit-mask of OpenSSL options to enable.<p>
The OpenSSL toolkit provides a set of options that applications can enable to tune the OpenSSL behavior.  Some of these work around bugs in other implementations and are on by default.  You can use the tls_disable_workarounds parameter to selectively disable some or all of the bug work-arounds, making OpenSSL more strict at the cost of non-interoperability with SSL clients or servers that exhibit the bugs.<p>
Other options are off by default, and typically enable or disable features rather than bug work-arounds.  These may be turned on (with care) via the tls_ssl_options parameter.  The value is a white-space or comma separated list of named options chosen from the list below. The names are not case-sensitive, you can use lower-case if you prefer.  The upper case values below match the corresponding macro name in the ssl.h header file with the SSL_OP_ prefix removed.  It is possible that your OpenSSL version includes new options added after your Postfix source code was last updated, in that case you can only enable one of these via the hexadecimal syntax below.<p>
You should only enable features via the hexadecimal mask when the need to control the feature is critical (to deal with a new vulnerability or a serious interoperability problem).  Postfix DOES NOT promise backwards compatible behavior with respect to the mask bits.  A feature enabled via the mask in one release may be enabled by other means in a later release, and the mask bit will then be ignored.  Therefore, use of the hexadecimal mask is only a temporary measure until a new Postfix or OpenSSL release provides a better solution.<p>
If the value of the parameter is a hexadecimal long integer starting with "0x", the options corresponding to the bits specified in its value are enabled (see openssl/ssl.h and SSL_CTX_ <b>set_options</b>(3)). You can only enable options not already controlled by other Postfix settings.  For example, you cannot disable protocols or enable server cipher preference.  Do not attempt to turn all features by specifying 0xFFFFFFFF, this is unlikely to be a good idea.<dl>

<h1>tls_wildcard_matches_multiple_labels (default: yes)</h1> Match multiple DNS labels with "*" in wildcard certificates.<p>
Some mail service providers prepend the customer domain name to a base domain for which they have a wildcard TLS certificate. For example, the MX records for example.com hosted by example.net may be:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

example.com. IN MX 0 example.com.mx1.example.net.<br>
example.com. IN MX 0 example.com.mx2.example.net.<br>
<br>
<p>
and the TLS certificate may be for "*.example.net". The "*" then corresponds with multiple labels in the mail server domain name.  While multi-label wildcards are not widely supported, and are not blessed by any standard, there is little to be gained by disallowing their use in this context.<p>

<h1>virtual_alias_domains (default: $virtual_alias_maps)</h1> Postfix is final destination for the specified list of virtual alias domains, that is, domains for which all addresses are aliased to addresses in other local or remote domains. The SMTP server validates recipient addresses with $virtual_alias_maps and rejects non-existent recipients. See also the virtual alias domain class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later. The default value is backwards compatible with Postfix version 1.1.<p>
The default value is $virtual_alias_maps so that you can keep all information about virtual alias domains in one place.  If you have many users, it is better to separate information that changes more frequently (virtual address -&gt; local or remote address mapping) from information that changes less frequently (the list of virtual domain names).<p>
Specify a list of host or domain names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a host or domain name from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>virtual_alias_recursion_limit (default: 1000)</h1> The maximal nesting depth of virtual alias expansion.  Currently the recursion limit is applied only to the left branch of the expansion graph, so the depth of the tree can in the worst case reach the sum of the expansion and recursion limits.  This may change in the future.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>virtual_destination_concurrency_limit (default: $default_destination_concurrency_limit)</h1> The maximal number of parallel deliveries to the same destination via the virtual message delivery transport.

<div class="section">
<h1>virtual_destination_recipient_limit (default: $default_destination_recipient_limit)</h1> The maximal number of recipients per message for the virtual message delivery transport. This limit is enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry in the master.cf file.<p>
Setting this parameter to a value of 1 changes the meaning of virtual_destination_concurrency_limit from concurrency per domain into concurrency per recipient.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>virtual_gid_maps (default: empty)</h1> Lookup tables with the per-recipient group ID for  <b>virtual</b>(8) mailbox delivery.<p>
This parameter is specific to the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent. It does not apply when mail is delivered with a different mail delivery program.<p>
In a lookup table, specify a left-hand side of "@domain.tld" to match any user in the specified domain that does not have a specific "user@domain.tld" entry.<p>
When a recipient address has an optional address extension (user+foo@domain.tld), the  <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent looks up the full address first, and when the lookup fails, it looks up the unextended address (user@domain.tld).<p>
Note 1: for security reasons, the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution of $1 etc. in regular expression lookup tables, because that would open a security hole.<p>
Note 2: for security reasons, the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent will silently ignore requests to use the  <b>proxymap</b>(8) server. Instead it will open the table directly. Before Postfix version 2.2, the  <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent will terminate with a fatal error.</div>
<div class="section">

This is a safety measure to ensure that an out of control map doesn't litter the file system with mailboxes.  While virtual_mailbox_base could be set to "/", this setting isn't recommended.<p>
This parameter is specific to the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent. It does not apply when mail is delivered with a different mail delivery program.<p>
Example:<p>
<br>
virtual_mailbox_base = /var/mail<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>virtual_mailbox_domains (default: $virtual_mailbox_maps)</h1> Postfix is final destination for the specified list of domains; mail is delivered via the $virtual_transport mail delivery transport. By default this is the Postfix  <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent.  The SMTP server validates recipient addresses with $virtual_mailbox_maps and rejects mail for non-existent recipients.  See also the virtual mailbox domain class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.<p>
This parameter expects the same syntax as the mydestination configuration parameter.<p>
This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later. The default value is backwards compatible with Postfix version 1.1.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>virtual_mailbox_limit (default: 51200000)</h1> The maximal size in bytes of an individual  <b>virtual</b>(8) mailbox or maildir file, or zero (no limit).<p>

This parameter is specific to the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent. It does not apply when mail is delivered with a different mail delivery program.<p>
This setting is ignored with <b>maildir</b> style delivery, because such deliveries are safe without application-level locks.<p>
Note 1: the <b>dotlock</b> method requires that the recipient UID or GID has write access to the parent directory of the recipient's mailbox file.<p>
Note 2: the default setting of this parameter is system dependent.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>virtual_mailbox_maps (default: empty)</h1> Optional lookup tables with all valid addresses in the domains that match $virtual_mailbox_domains.<p>
In a lookup table, specify a left-hand side of "@domain.tld" to match any user in the specified domain that does not have a specific "user@domain.tld" entry.<p>
The remainder of this text is specific to the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent.  It does not apply when mail is delivered with a different mail delivery program.<p>
The <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent uses this table to look up the per-recipient mailbox or maildir pathname.  If the lookup result ends in a slash ("/"), maildir-style delivery is carried out, otherwise the path is assumed to specify a UNIX-style mailbox file. Note that $virtual_mailbox_base is unconditionally prepended to this path.<p>
When a recipient address has an optional address extension (user+foo@domain.tld), the  <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent looks up the full address first, and when the lookup fails, it looks up the unextended address (user@domain.tld).<p>
Note 1: for security reasons, the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution of $1 etc. in regular expression lookup tables, because that would open a security hole.<p>
Note 2: for security reasons, the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent will silently ignore requests to use the  <b>proxymap</b>(8) server. Instead it will open the table directly. Before Postfix version 2.2, the  <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent will terminate with a fatal error.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>virtual_minimum_uid (default: 100)</h1> The minimum user ID value that the  <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent accepts as a result from $virtual_uid_maps table lookup.  Returned values less than this will be rejected, and the message will be deferred.<p>
This parameter is specific to the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent. It does not apply when mail is delivered with a different mail delivery program.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>virtual_transport (default: virtual)</h1> The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for final delivery to domains listed with $virtual_mailbox_domains. This information can be overruled with the  <b>transport</b>(5) table.<p>

<h1>virtual_uid_maps (default: empty)</h1> Lookup tables with the per-recipient user ID that the  <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent uses while writing to the recipient's mailbox.<p>
This parameter is specific to the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent. It does not apply when mail is delivered with a different mail delivery program.<p>
In a lookup table, specify a left-hand side of "@domain.tld" to match any user in the specified domain that does not have a specific "user@domain.tld" entry.<p>
When a recipient address has an optional address extension (user+foo@domain.tld), the  <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent looks up the full address first, and when the lookup fails, it looks up the unextended address (user@domain.tld).<p>
Note 1: for security reasons, the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution of $1 etc. in regular expression lookup tables, because that would open a security hole.<p>
Note 2: for security reasons, the <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent will silently ignore requests to use the  <b>proxymap</b>(8) server. Instead it will open the table directly. Before Postfix version 2.2, the  <b>virtual</b>(8) delivery agent will terminate with a fatal error.</div>
