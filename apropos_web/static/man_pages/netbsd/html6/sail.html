<h1 id="x4445534352495054494f4e">DESCRIPTION</h1> <b class="name">sail</b> is a computer version of Avalon Hill's game of fighting sail originally developed by S. Craig Taylor.<p>
Players of <b class="name">sail</b> take command of an old-fashioned Man of War and fight other players or the computer. They may re-enact one of the many historical sea battles recorded in the game, or they can choose a fictional battle.<p>
As a sea captain in the <b class="name">Sail</b> Navy, the player has complete control over the workings of his ship. He must order every maneuver, change the set of his sails, and judge the right moment to let loose the terrible destruction of his broadsides. In addition to fighting the enemy, he must harness the powers of the wind and sea to make them work for him. The outcome of many battles during the age of sail was decided by the ability of one captain to hold the &#8216;weather gage&#8217;.<p>

<h1 id="x494d504c454d454e544154494f4e">IMPLEMENTATION</h1> <b class="name">sail</b> is a multiplayer game. Each player runs <b class="name">sail</b> to either connect to an existing game or start a new one. The game server (or &#8220;driver&#8221;) is an extra fork of the <b class="name">sail</b> program created when a game is started. The driver coordinates the game and runs the computer ships.<p>
If a player joins a game in progress, a synchronization process occurs (a rather slow process for everyone), and then the game continues.<p>
Note that while each scenario can be running independently with different players, each scenario can also only be running once at any given time.<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x434f4d4d554e49434154494f4e">COMMUNICATION</h2> To implement a multi-user game in Version 7 UNIX, which was the operating system <b class="name">sail</b> was first written under, the communicating processes must use a common temporary file as a place to read and write messages. For e.g. scenario 21, this file is <i class="file">/var/games/sail/#sailsink.21</i>. Corresponding file names are used for the other scenarios.<p>
In addition, a locking mechanism must be provided to ensure exclusive access to the shared file. <b class="name">sail</b> uses a technique stolen from an old game called &#8220;pubcaves&#8221; by Jeff Cohen. Processes do a busy wait in the loop<p>
<pre style="margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="lit display">
for (n = 0; link(sync_file, sync_lock) &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; n &lt; 30; n++) 
        sleep(2); 
</pre>
until they are able to create a hard link named e.g. <i class="file">/var/games/sail/#saillock.21</i>. where 21 is again the scenario number. Since creating a hard link is atomic, a process where this succeeds will have exclusive access to the temporary file.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x434f4e53455155454e434553204f4620534550415241544520504c4159455220414e44204452495645522050524f434553534553">CONSEQUENCES OF SEPARATE PLAYER AND DRIVER PROCESSES</h2> When players do something of global interest, such as moving or firing, the driver must coordinate the action with the other ships in the game. For example, if a player wants to move in a certain direction, he writes a message into the temporary file requesting the driver to move his ship. Each &#8220;turn&#8221;, the driver reads all the messages sent from the players and decides what happened. It then writes back into the temporary file new values of variables, etc.<p>
The most noticeable effect this communication has on the game is the delay in moving. Suppose a player types a move for his ship and hits return. What happens then? The player process saves up messages to be written to the temporary file in a buffer. Every 7 seconds or so, the player process gets exclusive access to the temporary file and writes out its buffer to the file. The driver, running asynchronously, must read in the movement command, process it, and write out the results. This takes two exclusive accesses to the temporary file. Finally, when the player process gets around to doing another 7-second update, the results of the move are displayed on the screen. Hence, every movement requires four exclusive accesses to the temporary file (anywhere from 7 to 21 seconds depending upon asynchrony) before the player sees the results of his moves.<p>
In practice, the delays are not as annoying as they would appear. There is room for &#8220;pipelining&#8221; in the movement. After the player writes out a first movement message, a second movement command can then be issued. The first message will be in the temporary file waiting for the driver, and the second will be in the file buffer waiting to be written to the file. Thus, by always typing moves a turn ahead of the time, the player can sail around quite quickly.<p>
If the player types several movement commands between two 7-second updates, only the last movement command typed will be seen by the driver. Movement commands within the same update &#8220;overwrite&#8221; each other, in a sense.</div>

<h1 id="x484953544f524943414c20494e464f">HISTORICAL INFO</h1> Old square-riggers were very maneuverable ships capable of intricate sailing. Their only disadvantage was an inability to sail very close to the wind. The design of a wooden ship allowed for the guns to bear only to the left and right sides. A few guns of small aspect (usually 6 or 9 pounders) could point forward, but their effect was small compared to a 68 gun broadside of 24- or 32-pounders. The guns bear approximately like so:<p>
<pre style="margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="lit display">
 
       \ 
        b---------------- 
    ---0 
        \ 
         \ 
          \     up to a range of ten (for round shot) 
           \ 
            \ 
             \ 
</pre>
Firing a broadside into a ship lengthwise, from bow to stern or stern to bow, is called <span class="emph">raking</span>. This did a great deal more damage, because the shot tended to bounce along the deck. Because the bows of a ship are very strong and present a smaller target than the stern, a stern rake (firing from the stern to the bow) causes more damage than a bow rake.<p>
<pre style="margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="lit display">

Most ships were equipped with <span class="emph">carronades</span>, which were very large, close range cannons. American ships from the revolution until the War of 1812 were almost entirely armed with carronades.<p>
The period of history covered in <b class="name">sail</b> is approximately from the 1770's until the end of Napoleonic France in 1815. There are many excellent books about the age of sail. (See <i class="link-sec"><a class="link-sec" href="#x5245464552454e434553">REFERENCES</a></i>).<p>
Fighting ships came in several sizes classed by armament. The mainstays of any fleet were its <span class="emph">ships of the line</span>, or <span class="emph">line of battle ships</span>. These were so named because in fleet actions they would sail in lines so as to present all broadsides to the enemy at once. The modern terms &#8220;ocean liner&#8221;, and &#8220;battleship&#8221; are derived from &#8220;ship of the line&#8221;.<p>
The pride of the fleet were the &#8220;first-rates&#8221;. These were huge three decked ships of the line mounting 80 to 136 guns. The guns in the three tiers were usually 18, 24, and 32 pounders in that order from top to bottom.<p>
Lesser ships were known as &#8220;second-rates&#8221;, &#8220;third-rates&#8221;, and even &#8220;fourth-rates&#8221;. The most common size was the 74 gun two-decked ship of the line. The two gun decks usually mounted 18 and 24 pounder guns.<p>
<span class="emph">Razees</span> were ships of the line with one deck sawed off. These mounted 40-64 guns and were a poor cross between a frigate and a line of battle ship. They neither had the speed of the former nor the firepower of the latter.<p>
The next class was the <span class="emph">frigate</span>. Often called the &#8220;eyes of the fleet&#8221;, frigates came in many sizes mounting anywhere from 32 to 44 guns. These were very handy vessels. They could outsail anything bigger and outshoot anything smaller. Frigates did not generally fight in lines of battle as the much bigger 74s did. Instead, they were sent on individual missions or in small groups to harass the enemy's rear or capture crippled ships. They were much more useful this way, in missions away from the fleet. They could hit hard and get away fast.<p>
Lastly, there were the corvettes, sloops, and brigs. These were smaller ships mounting typically fewer than 20 guns. A corvette was only slightly smaller than a frigate, so one might have up to 30 guns. Sloops were used for carrying despatches or passengers. Brigs were small vessels typically built for land-locked lakes.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x5341494c20504152544943554c415253">SAIL PARTICULARS</h1> Ships in <b class="name">sail</b> are represented on the screen by two characters. One character represents the bow of the ship, and the other represents the stern. Ships have nationalities and numbers. The first ship of a nationality is number 0, the second number 1, etc. Therefore, the first British ship in a game would be printed as &#8220;b0&#8221;. The second Brit would be &#8220;b1&#8221;, and the fifth Don would be &#8220;s4&#8221;.<p>
Ships can set normal sails, called <span class="emph">Battle Sails</span>, or bend on extra canvas called <span class="emph">Full Sails</span>. A ship under full sail is a beautiful sight indeed, and it can move much faster than a ship under battle sails. The only trouble is, with full sails set, there is so much tension on sail and rigging that a well aimed round shot can burst a sail into ribbons where it would only cause a little hole in a loose sail. For this reason, rigging damage is doubled on a ship with full sails set. This does not mean that full sails should never be used; the author recommends keeping them up right into the heat of battle. When a ship has full sails set, the letter for its nationality is capitalized. E.g., a Frog, &#8220;f0&#8221;, with full sails set would be printed as &#8220;F0&#8221;.<p>
When a ship is battered into a listing hulk, the last man aboard <span class="emph">strikes the colors</span>. This ceremony is the ship's formal surrender. The nationality character of a surrendered ship is printed as &#8216;!&#8217;. E.g., the Frog of our last example would soon be &#8220;!0&#8221;.<p>
A ship that reaches this point has a chance of catching fire or sinking. A sinking ship has a &#8216;~&#8217; printed for its nationality, and a ship on fire and about to explode has a &#8216;#&#8217; printed.<p>
Ships that have struck can be captured; captured ships become the nationality of the prize crew. Therefore, if an American ship captures a British ship, the British ship will thenceforth have an &#8216;a&#8217; printed for its nationality. In addition, the ship number is changed to one of the characters &#8216;&amp;'()*+&#8217; corresponding to its original number &#8216;012345&#8217;. E.g., the &#8220;b0&#8221; captured by an American becomes the &#8220;a&amp;&#8221;. The &#8220;s4&#8221; captured by a Frog becomes the &#8220;f*&#8221;.<p>
The ultimate example is, of course, an exploding Brit captured by an American: &#8220;#&amp;&#8221;.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x4d4f56454d454e54">MOVEMENT</h1> Movement is the most confusing part of <b class="name">sail</b> to many. Ships can head in 8 directions:<p>
<pre style="margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="lit display">
                         0      0      0 
b       b       b0      b       b       b       0b      b 
0        0                                             0 
</pre>
The stern of a ship moves when it turns. The bow remains stationary. Ships can always turn, regardless of the wind (unless they are becalmed). All ships drift when they lose headway. If a ship doesn't move forward at all for two turns, it will begin to drift. If a ship has begun to drift, then it must move forward before it turns, if it plans to do more than make a right or left turn, which is always possible.<p>
Movement commands to <b class="name">sail</b> are a string of forward moves and turns. An example is &#8220;l3&#8221;. It will turn a ship left and then move it ahead 3 spaces. In the drawing above, the &#8220;b0&#8221; made 7 successive left turns. When <b class="name">sail</b> prompts you for a move, it prints three characters of import. E.g.,<blockquote style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;">
<div class="display">
<code class="lit">move (7, 4):</code></div>
</blockquote>
The first number is the maximum number of moves you can make, including turns. The second number is the maximum number of turns you can make. Between the numbers is sometimes printed a quote ('). If the quote is present, it means that your ship has been drifting, and you must move ahead to regain headway before you turn (see note above). Some of the possible moves for the example above are as follows:<p>
<pre style="margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="lit display">
move (7, 4): 7 
move (7, 4): 1 
move (7, 4): d          /* drift, or do nothing */ 
move (7, 4): 6r 
move (7, 4): 5r1 
move (7, 4): 4r1r 
move (7, 4): l1r1r2 
move (7, 4): 1r1r1r1</pre>
<p>
Because square riggers performed so poorly sailing into the wind, if at any point in a movement command you turn into the wind, the movement stops there. E.g.,<p>
<pre style="margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="lit display">
move (7, 4): l1l4 
Movement Error; 
Helm: l1l 
</pre>
Moreover, upon making a turn, the movement allowance drops to the lesser of what remains this turn and what would be available when going in the new direction. Thus, any turn closer to the wind will generally preclude sailing the full distance printed in the &#8220;move&#8221; prompt.<p>
Old sailing captains had to keep an eye constantly on the wind. Captains in <b class="name">sail</b> are no different. A ship's ability to move depends on its attitude to the wind. The best angle possible is to have the wind off your quarter, that is, just off the stern. The direction rose on the side of the screen gives the possible movements for your ship at all positions to the wind. Battle sail speeds are given first, and full sail speeds are given in parenthesis.<p>
<pre style="margin-left: 0.00ex;" class="lit display">

Pretend the bow of your ship (the &#8220;^&#8221;) is pointing upward and the wind is blowing from the bottom to the top of the page. The numbers at the bottom &#8220;3(6)&#8221; will be your speed under battle or full sails in such a situation. If the wind is off your quarter, then you can move &#8220;4(7)&#8221;. If the wind is off your beam, &#8220;3(6)&#8221;. If the wind is off your bow, then you can only move &#8220;1(2)&#8221;. Facing into the wind, you cannot move at all. Ships facing into the wind are said to be <span class="emph">in irons</span>.</div>

The number in the middle of the vane indicates the wind speed, and the + to - indicates the wind direction. The wind blows from the + sign (high pressure) to the - sign (low pressure). E.g.,<p>

<h1 id="x47524150504c494e4720414e4420464f554c494e47">GRAPPLING AND FOULING</h1> If two ships collide, they run the risk of becoming tangled together. This is called <span class="emph">fouling</span>. Fouled ships are stuck together, and neither can move. They can unfoul each other if they want to. Boarding parties can only be sent across to ships when the antagonists are either fouled or grappled.<p>
Ships can grapple each other by throwing grapnels into the rigging of the other.<p>
The number of fouls and grapples you have are displayed on the upper right of the screen.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x424f415244494e47">BOARDING</h1> Boarding was a very costly venture in terms of human life. Boarding parties may be formed in <b class="name">sail</b> to either board an enemy ship or to defend your own ship against attack. Men organized as Defensive Boarding Parties fight twice as hard to save their ship as men left unorganized.<p>
The boarding strength of a crew depends upon its quality and upon the number of men sent.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x43524557205155414c495459">CREW QUALITY</h1> The British seaman was world renowned for his sailing abilities. American sailors, however, were actually the best seamen in the world. Because the American Navy offered twice the wages of the Royal Navy, British seamen who liked the sea defected to America by the thousands.<p>
In <b class="name">sail</b>, crew quality is quantized into 5 energy levels. <span class="emph">Elite</span> crews can outshoot and outfight all other sailors. <span class="emph">Crack</span> crews are next. <span class="emph">Mundane</span> crews are average, and <span class="emph">Green</span> and <span class="emph">Mutinous</span> crews are below average. A good rule of thumb is that <span class="emph">Crack</span> or <span class="emph">Elite</span> crews get one extra hit per broadside compared to <span class="emph">Mundane</span> crews. Don't expect too much from <span class="emph">Green</span> crews.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x42524f41445349444553">BROADSIDES</h1> Your two broadsides may be loaded with four kinds of shot: grape, chain, round, and double. You have guns and carronades in both the port and starboard batteries. Carronades only have a range of two, so you have to get in close to be able to fire them. You have the choice of firing at the hull or rigging of another ship. If the range of the ship is greater than 6, then you may only shoot at the rigging.<p>
The types of shot and their advantages are:<dl style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;" class="list list-tag">
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">

A &#8216;*&#8217; after the type of shot indicates that the gun crews are still loading it, and you cannot fire yet. &#8220;Hull&#8221; shows how much hull you have left. &#8220;Crew&#8221; shows your three sections of crew. As your crew dies off, your ability to fire decreases. &#8220;Guns&#8221; and &#8220;Carr&#8221; show your port and starboard guns. As you lose guns, your ability to fire decreases. &#8220;Rigg&#8221; shows how much rigging you have on your 3 or 4 masts. As rigging is shot away, you lose mobility.</div>

<h1 id="x4546464543544956454e455353204f462046495245">EFFECTIVENESS OF FIRE</h1> It is very dramatic when a ship fires its thunderous broadsides, but the mere opportunity to fire them does not guarantee any hits. Many factors influence the destructive force of a broadside. First of all, and the chief factor, is distance. It is harder to hit a ship at range ten than it is to hit one sloshing alongside. Next is raking. Raking fire, as mentioned before, can sometimes dismast a ship at range ten. Next, crew size and quality affects the damage done by a broadside. The number of guns firing also bears on the point, so to speak. Lastly, weather affects the accuracy of a broadside. If the seas are high (5 or 6), then the lower gunports of ships of the line can't even be opened to run out the guns. This gives frigates and other flush decked vessels an advantage in a storm. The scenario <span class="emph">Pellew vs. The Droits de L'Homme</span> takes advantage of this peculiar circumstance.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x52455041495253">REPAIRS</h1> Repairs may be made to your Hull, Guns, and Rigging at the slow rate of two points per three turns. The message "Repairs Completed" will be printed if no more repairs can be made.</div>

<h1 id="x504543554c4941524954494553204f4620434f4d5055544552205348495053">PECULIARITIES OF COMPUTER SHIPS</h1> Computer ships in <b class="name">sail</b> follow all the rules above with a few exceptions. Computer ships never repair damage. If they did, the players could never beat them. They play well enough as it is. As a consolation, the computer ships can fire double shot every turn. That fluke is a good reason to keep your distance. The driver figures out the moves of the computer ships. It computes them with a typical A.I. distance function and a depth first search to find the maximum &#8220;score&#8221;. It seems to work fairly well, although I'll be the first to admit it isn't perfect.</div>

<h1 id="x484953544f5259">HISTORY</h1> Dave Riggle wrote the first version of <b class="name">sail</b> on a PDP&#45;11/70 in the fall of 1980. Needless to say, the code was horrendous, not portable in any sense of the word, and didn't work. The program was not very modular and had <a class="link-man" href="../3/fseek">fseek(3)</a> and <a class="link-man" href="../3/fwrite">fwrite(3)</a> calls every few lines. After a tremendous rewrite from the top down, the first working version was up and running by 1981. There were several annoying bugs concerning firing broadsides and finding angles.<p>
Ed Wang rewrote the <b class="fname">angle</b>() routine in 1981 to be more correct. He also added code to let a player select which ship he wanted at the start of the game, instead of always taking the first one available.<p>
Captain Happy (Craig Leres) is responsible for making <b class="name">sail</b> portable for the first time. This was no easy task. Constants like 2 and 10 were very frequent in the code. The <b class="name">sail</b> code was also notorious for the use of &#8220;Riggle Memorial Structures&#8221;. Many structure references were so long that they ran off the line printer page. Here is an example, if you promise not to laugh:<p>
<pre style="margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="lit display">

<p>
<b class="name">sail</b> received its fourth and most thorough rewrite in the summer and fall of 1983. Ed Wang rewrote and modularized the code (a monumental feat) almost from scratch. Although he introduced many new bugs, the final result was very much cleaner and (?) faster. He added window movement commands and find ship commands.<p>
At some currently unknown time, <b class="name">sail</b> was imported into <span class="unix">BSD</span>.</div>
