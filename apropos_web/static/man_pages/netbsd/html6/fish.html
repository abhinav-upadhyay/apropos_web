<h1 id="x4445534352495054494f4e">DESCRIPTION</h1> <b class="name">fish</b> is the game &#8220;Go Fish&#8221;, a traditional children's card game.<p>
The computer deals the player and itself seven cards, and places the rest of the deck face-down (figuratively). The object of the game is to collect &#8220;books&#8221;, or all of the members of a single rank. For example, collecting four 2's would give the player a &#8220;book of 2's&#8221;.<p>
The options are as follows:<dl style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;" class="list list-tag">
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
<b class="flag">&#45;p</b></dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 6.00ex;">
Professional mode.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The computer makes a random decision as to who gets to start the game, and then the computer and player take turns asking each other for cards of a specified rank. If the asked player has any cards of the requested rank, they give them up to the asking player. A player must have at least one of the cards of the rank they request in their hand. When a player asks for a rank of which the other player has no cards, the asker is told to &#8220;Go Fish!&#8221;. Then, the asker draws a card from the non-dealt cards. If they draw the card they asked for, they continue their turn, asking for more ranks from the other player. Otherwise, the other player gets a turn.<p>
When a player completes a book, either by getting cards from the other player or drawing from the deck, they set those cards aside and the rank is no longer in play.<p>
The game ends when either player no longer has any cards in their hand. The player with the most books wins.<p>
