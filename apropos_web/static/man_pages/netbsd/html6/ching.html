<h1 id="x4445534352495054494f4e">DESCRIPTION</h1> The <span class="emph">I Ching</span> or <span class="emph">Book of Changes</span> is an ancient Chinese oracle that has been in use for centuries as a source of wisdom and advice.<p>
The text of the <span class="emph">oracle</span> (as it is sometimes known) consists of sixty-four <span class="emph">hexagrams</span>, each symbolized by a particular arrangement of six straight (&#45;&#45;&#45;) and broken (&#45;&#160;&#45;) lines.  These lines have values ranging from six through nine, with the even values indicating the broken lines.<p>
Each hexagram consists of two major sections.  The <span class="symb">Judgement</span> relates specifically to the matter at hand (e.g., &#8220;It furthers one to have somewhere to go.&#8221;) while the <span class="symb">Image</span> describes the general attributes of the hexagram and how they apply to one's own life (&#8220;Thus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.&#8221;)<p>
When any of the lines have the values six or nine, they are moving lines; for each there is an appended judgement which becomes significant. Furthermore, the moving lines are inherently unstable and change into their opposites; a second hexagram (and thus an additional judgement) is formed.<p>
Normally, one consults the oracle by fixing the desired question firmly in mind and then casting a set of changes (lines) using yarrow&#45;stalks or tossed coins.  The resulting hexagram will be the answer to the question.<p>
Using an algorithm suggested by S. C. Johnson, the <span class="unix">UNIX</span> <span class="emph">oracle</span> simply reads a question from the standard input (up to an EOF) and hashes the individual characters in combination with the time of day, process id and any other magic numbers which happen to be lying around the system. The resulting value is used as the seed of a random number generator which drives a simulated coin&#45;toss divination. The answer is then piped through <a class="link-man" href="../1/nroff">nroff(1)</a> for formatting and will appear on the standard output.<p>
For those who wish to remain steadfast in the old traditions, the oracle will also accept the results of a personal divination using, for example, coins. To do this, cast the change and then type the resulting line values as an argument.<p>
The impatient modern may prefer to settle for Chinese cookies; try <a class="link-man" href="../6/fortune">fortune(6)</a>.</div>
