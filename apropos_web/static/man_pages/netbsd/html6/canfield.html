<h1 id="x4445534352495054494f4e">DESCRIPTION</h1> If you have never played solitaire before, it is recommended that you consult a solitaire instruction book. In Canfield, tableau cards may be built on each other downward in alternate colors. An entire pile must be moved as a unit in building. Top cards of the piles are available to be played on foundations, but never into empty spaces.<p>
Spaces must be filled from the stock. The top card of the stock also is available to be played on foundations or built on tableau piles. After the stock is exhausted, tableau spaces may be filled from the talon and the player may keep them open until he wishes to use them.<p>
Cards are dealt from the hand to the talon by threes and this repeats until there are no more cards in the hand or the player quits. To have cards dealt onto the talon the player types &#8216;<b class="cmd">ht</b>&#8217; for his move. Foundation base cards are also automatically moved to the foundation when they become available.<p>
The command &#8216;<b class="cmd">c</b>&#8217; causes <b class="name">canfield</b> to maintain card counting statistics on the bottom of the screen. When properly used this can greatly increase one's chances of winning.<p>
The rules for betting are somewhat less strict than those used in the official version of the game. The initial deal costs $13. You may quit at this point or inspect the game. Inspection costs $13 and allows you to make as many moves as possible without moving any cards from your hand to the talon. (The initial deal places three cards on the talon; if all these cards are used, three more are made available.) Finally, if the game seems interesting, you must pay the final installment of $26. At this point you are credited at the rate of $5 for each card on the foundation; as the game progresses you are credited with $5 for each card that is moved to the foundation. Each run through the hand after the first costs $5. The card counting feature costs $1 for each unknown card that is identified. If the information is toggled on, you are only charged for cards that became visible since it was last turned on. Thus the maximum cost of information is $34. Playing time is charged at a rate of $1 per minute.<p>
With no arguments, the program <b class="name">cfscores</b> prints out the current status of your canfield account. If a <i class="arg">user</i> name is specified, it prints out the status of their canfield account. If the <b class="flag">&#45;a</b> flag is specified, it prints out the canfield accounts for all users that have played the game since the database was set up.</div>
