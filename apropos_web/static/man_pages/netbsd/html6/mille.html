<h1 id="x4445534352495054494f4e">DESCRIPTION</h1> <b class="name">Mille</b> plays a two-handed game reminiscent of the Parker Brother's game of Mille Bornes with you. The rules are described below. If a file name is given on the command line, the game saved in that file is started.<p>
When a game is started up, the bottom of the score window will contain a list of commands. They are:<dl style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;" class="list list-tag">
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
<b class="cmd">P</b></dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
Pick a card from the deck. This card is placed in the &#8216;P&#8217; slot in your hand.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
<b class="cmd">D</b></dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
Discard a card from your hand. To indicate which card, type the number of the card in the hand (or &#8216;P&#8217; for the just-picked card) followed by a &#60;RETURN&#62; or &#60;SPACE&#62;. The &#60;RETURN&#62; or &#60;SPACE&#62; is required to allow recovery from typos which can be very expensive, like discarding safeties.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
<b class="cmd">U</b></dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
Use a card. The card is again indicated by its number, followed by a &#60;RETURN&#62; or &#60;SPACE&#62;.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
<b class="cmd">O</b></dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
Toggle ordering the hand. By default off, if turned on it will sort the cards in your hand appropriately. This is not recommended for the impatient on slow terminals.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
<b class="cmd">Q</b></dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
Quit the game. This will ask for confirmation, just to be sure. Hitting &#60;DELETE&#62; (or &#60;RUBOUT&#62;) is equivalent.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
<b class="cmd">S</b></dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
Save the game in a file. If the game was started from a file, you will be given an opportunity to save it on the same file. If you don't wish to, or you did not start from a file, you will be asked for the file name. If you type a &#60;RETURN&#62; without a name, the save will be terminated and the game resumed.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
<b class="cmd">R</b></dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
Redraw the screen from scratch. The command ^L (control &#8216;L&#8217;) will also work.</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
<b class="cmd">W</b></dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
Toggle window type. This switches the score window between the startup window (with all the command names) and the end-of-game window. Using the end-of-game window saves time by eliminating the switch at the end of the game to show the final score. Recommended for hackers and other miscreants.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
If you make a mistake, an error message will be printed on the last line of the score window, and a bell will beep.<p>
At the end of each hand or game, you will be asked if you wish to play another. If not, it will ask you if you want to save the game. If you do, and the save is unsuccessful, play will be resumed as if you had said you wanted to play another hand/game. This allows you to use the &#8220;<b class="cmd">S</b>&#8221; command to reattempt the save.</div>

<h2 id="x4f626a656374203a">Object:</h2> The point of this game is to get a total of 5000 points in several hands. Each hand is a race to put down exactly 700 miles before your opponent does. Beyond the points gained by putting down milestones, there are several other ways of making points.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x4f76657276696577203a">Overview:</h2> The game is played with a deck of 101 cards. <span class="emph">Distance</span> cards represent a number of miles traveled. They come in denominations of 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200. When one is played, it adds that many miles to the player's trip so far this hand. <span class="emph">Hazard</span> cards are used to prevent your opponent from putting down Distance cards. They can only be played if your opponent has a <span class="emph">Go</span> card on top of the Battle pile. The cards are <span class="symb">Out of Gas</span>, <span class="symb">Accident</span>, <span class="symb">Flat Tire</span>, <span class="symb">Speed Limit</span>, and <span class="symb">Stop</span>. <span class="emph">Remedy</span> cards fix problems caused by Hazard cards played on you by your opponent. The cards are <span class="symb">Gasoline</span>, <span class="symb">Repairs</span>, <span class="symb">Spare Tire</span>, <span class="symb">End of Limit</span>, and <span class="symb">Go</span>. <span class="emph">Safety</span> cards prevent your opponent from putting specific Hazard cards on you in the first place. They are <span class="symb">Extra Tank</span>, <span class="symb">Driving Ace</span>, <span class="symb">Puncture Proof</span>, and <span class="symb">Right of Way</span>, and there are only one of each in the deck.</div>

<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x506c6179203a">Play:</h2> The first pick alternates between the two players. Each turn usually starts with a pick from the deck. The player then plays a card, or if this is not possible or desirable, discards one. Normally, a play or discard of a single card constitutes a turn. If the card played is a safety, however, the same player takes another turn immediately.<p>
This repeats until one of the players reaches 700 points or the deck runs out. If someone reaches 700, they have the option of going for an <span class="emph">Extension</span>, which means that the play continues until someone reaches 1000 miles.</div>

<h2 id="x44697374616e6365204361726473203a">Distance Cards:</h2> Distance cards are played when you have a <span class="symb">Go</span> card on your Battle pile, or a Right of Way in your Safety area and are not stopped by a Hazard Card. They can be played in any combination that totals exactly 700 miles, except that <span class="emph">you cannot play more than two 200 mile cards in one hand</span>. A hand ends whenever one player gets exactly 700 miles or the deck runs out. In that case, play continues until neither someone reaches 700, or neither player can use any cards in their hand.

<h2 id="x436f757020466f7572725c282765203a">Coup Fourr&#233;:</h2> This is a French fencing term for a counter-thrust move as part of a parry to an opponent's attack. In current French colloquial language it means a sneaky, underhanded blow. In Mille Bornes, it is used as follows: If an opponent plays a Hazard card, and you have the corresponding Safety in your hand, you play it immediately, even <span class="emph">before</span> you draw. This immediately removes the Hazard card from your Battle pile, and protects you from that card for the rest of the game.
