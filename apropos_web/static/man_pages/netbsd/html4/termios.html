For most hardware, the presence of a connection is indicated by the assertion of the hardware <span class="emph">CARRIER DETECT</span> (CD) line. If the <b class="name">termios</b> structure associated with the terminal file has the <span class="define">CLOCAL</span> flag set in the cflag, or if the <span class="define">O_NONBLOCK</span> flag is set in the <a class="link-man" href="../2/open">open(2)</a> call, then the open will succeed even without a connection being present.<p>
In practice, applications seldom open these files; they are opened by special programs, such as <a class="link-man" href="../8/getty">getty(8)</a> or <a class="link-man" href="../8/rlogind">rlogind(8)</a>, and become an application's standard input, output, and error files.</div>

<h2 id="x4a6f6220436f6e74726f6c20696e2061204e75747368656c6c">Job Control in a Nutshell</h2> Every process is associated with a particular process group and session. The grouping is hierarchical: every member of a particular process group is a member of the same session. This structuring is used in managing groups of related processes for purposes of <span class="emph">job control</span>; that is, the ability from the keyboard (or from program control) to simultaneously stop or restart a complex command (a command composed of one or more related processes).<p>
The grouping into process groups allows delivering of signals that stop or start the group as a whole, along with arbitrating which process group has access to the single controlling terminal. The grouping at a higher layer into sessions is to restrict the job control related signals and system calls to within processes resulting from a particular instance of a "login".<p>
Typically, a session is created when a user logs in, and the login terminal is set up to be the controlling terminal; all processes spawned from that login shell are in the same session, and inherit the controlling terminal. A job control shell operating interactively (that is, reading commands from a terminal) normally groups related processes together by placing them into the same process group. A set of processes in the same process group is collectively referred to as a "job".<p>
When the foreground process group of the terminal is the same as the process group of a particular job, that job is said to be in the <span class="emph">foreground</span>. When the process group of the terminal is different than the process group of a job (but is still the controlling terminal), that job is said to be in the <span class="emph">background</span>.<p>
Normally the shell reads a command and starts the job that implements that command. If the command is to be started in the foreground (typical), it sets the process group of the terminal to the process group of the started job, waits for the job to complete, and then sets the process group of the terminal back to its own process group (it puts itself into the foreground).<p>
If the job is to be started in the background (as denoted by the shell operator "&amp;"), it never changes the process group of the terminal and doesn't wait for the job to complete (that is, it immediately attempts to read the next command).<p>
If the job is started in the foreground, the user may type a character (usually &#8216;<code class="lit">^Z</code>&#8217;) which generates the terminal stop signal (<span class="define">SIGTSTP</span>) and has the affect of stopping the entire job. The shell will notice that the job stopped (see <a class="link-man" href="../2/wait">wait(2)</a>), and will resume running after placing itself in the foreground.<p>
The shell also has commands for placing stopped jobs in the background, and for placing stopped or background jobs into the foreground.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x4f727068616e65642050726f636573732047726f757073">Orphaned Process Groups</h2> An orphaned process group is a process group that has no process whose parent is in a different process group, yet is in the same session. Conceptually it means a process group that doesn't have a parent that could do anything if it were to be stopped. For example, the initial login shell is typically in an orphaned process group. Orphaned process groups are immune to keyboard generated stop signals and job control signals resulting from reads or writes to the controlling terminal.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x54686520436f6e74726f6c6c696e67205465726d696e616c">The Controlling Terminal</h2> A terminal may belong to a process as its controlling terminal. Each process of a session that has a controlling terminal has the same controlling terminal. A terminal may be the controlling terminal for at most one session. The controlling terminal for a session is allocated by the session leader by issuing the <span class="define">TIOCSCTTY</span> ioctl. A controlling terminal is never acquired by merely opening a terminal device file. When a controlling terminal becomes associated with a session, its foreground process group is set to the process group of the session leader.<p>
The controlling terminal is inherited by a child process during a <a class="link-man" href="../2/fork">fork(2)</a> function call. A process relinquishes its controlling terminal when it creates a new session with the <a class="link-man" href="../2/setsid">setsid(2)</a> function; other processes remaining in the old session that had this terminal as their controlling terminal continue to have it. A process does not relinquish its controlling terminal simply by closing all of its file descriptors associated with the controlling terminal if other processes continue to have it open.<p>
When a controlling process terminates, the controlling terminal is disassociated from the current session, allowing it to be acquired by a new session leader. Subsequent access to the terminal by other processes in the earlier session will be denied, with attempts to access the terminal treated as if modem disconnect had been sensed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x5465726d696e616c2041636365737320436f6e74726f6c">Terminal Access Control</h2> If a process is in the foreground process group of its controlling terminal, read operations are allowed. Any attempts by a process in a background process group to read from its controlling terminal causes a <span class="define">SIGTTIN</span> signal to be sent to the process's group unless one of the following special cases apply:  If the reading process is ignoring or blocking the <span class="define">SIGTTIN</span> signal, or if the process group of the reading process is orphaned, the <a class="link-man" href="../2/read">read(2)</a> returns -1 with <b class="var">errno set to</b> <span class="errno">EIO</span> and no signal is sent. The default action of the <span class="define">SIGTTIN</span> signal is to stop the process to which it is sent.<p>
If a process is in the foreground process group of its controlling terminal, write operations are allowed. Attempts by a process in a background process group to write to its controlling terminal will cause the process group to be sent a <span class="define">SIGTTOU</span> signal unless one of the following special cases apply:  If <span class="define">TOSTOP</span> is not set, or if <span class="define">TOSTOP</span> is set and the process is ignoring or blocking the <span class="define">SIGTTOU</span> signal, the process is allowed to write to the terminal and the <span class="define">SIGTTOU</span> signal is not sent. If <span class="define">TOSTOP</span> is set, and the process group of the writing process is orphaned, and the writing process is not ignoring or blocking <span class="define">SIGTTOU</span>, the <a class="link-man" href="../2/write">write(2)</a> returns -1 with errno set to <span class="errno">EIO</span> and no signal is sent.<p>
Certain calls that set terminal parameters are treated in the same fashion as write, except that <span class="define">TOSTOP</span> is ignored; that is, the effect is identical to that of terminal writes when <span class="define">TOSTOP</span> is set.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x496e7075742050726f63657373696e6720616e642052656164696e672044617461">Input Processing and Reading Data</h2> A terminal device associated with a terminal device file may operate in full-duplex mode, so that data may arrive even while output is occurring. Each terminal device file has associated with it an input queue, into which incoming data is stored by the system before being read by a process. The system imposes a limit, &#123;<span class="define">MAX_INPUT</span>&#125;, on the number of bytes that may be stored in the input queue. The behavior of the system when this limit is exceeded depends on the setting of the <span class="define">IMAXBEL</span> flag in the <b class="name">termios</b> <i class="farg">c_iflag</i>. If this flag is set, the terminal is sent an ASCII <span class="define">BEL</span> character each time a character is received while the input queue is full. Otherwise, the input queue is flushed upon receiving the character.<p>
Two general kinds of input processing are available, determined by whether the terminal device file is in canonical mode or noncanonical mode. Additionally, input characters are processed according to the <i class="farg">c_iflag</i> and <i class="farg">c_lflag</i> fields. Such processing can include echoing, which in general means transmitting input characters immediately back to the terminal when they are received from the terminal. This is useful for terminals that can operate in full-duplex mode.<p>
The manner in which data is provided to a process reading from a terminal device file is dependent on whether the terminal device file is in canonical or noncanonical mode.<p>
Another dependency is whether the <span class="define">O_NONBLOCK</span> flag is set by <a class="link-man" href="../2/open">open(2)</a> or <a class="link-man" href="../2/fcntl">fcntl(2)</a>. If the <span class="define">O_NONBLOCK</span> flag is clear, then the read request is blocked until data is available or a signal has been received. If the <span class="define">O_NONBLOCK</span> flag is set, then the read request is completed, without blocking, in one of three ways:<ol style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="list list-enum">
<li class="list-enum" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
If there is enough data available to satisfy the entire request, and the read completes successfully the number of bytes read is returned.</li>
<li class="list-enum" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
If there is not enough data available to satisfy the entire request, and the read completes successfully, having read as much data as possible, the number of bytes read is returned.</li>
<li class="list-enum" style="margin-top: 1.00em;">
If there is no data available, the read returns -1, with errno set to <span class="errno">EAGAIN</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
When data is available depends on whether the input processing mode is canonical or noncanonical.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x43616e6f6e6963616c204d6f646520496e7075742050726f63657373696e67">Canonical Mode Input Processing</h2> In canonical mode input processing, terminal input is processed in units of lines. A line is delimited by a newline &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;n</code>&#8217; character, an end-of-file (<span class="define">EOF</span>) character, or an end-of-line (<span class="define">EOL</span>) character. See the <i class="link-sec"><a class="link-sec" href="#x5370656369616c2043686172616374657273">Special Characters</a></i> section for more information on <span class="define">EOF</span> and <span class="define">EOL</span>. This means that a read request will not return until an entire line has been typed, or a signal has been received. Also, no matter how many bytes are requested in the read call, at most one line is returned. It is not, however, necessary to read a whole line at once; any number of bytes, even one, may be requested in a read without losing information.<p>
&#123;<span class="define">MAX_CANON</span>&#125; is a limit on the number of bytes in a line. The behavior of the system when this limit is exceeded is the same as when the input queue limit &#123;<span class="define">MAX_INPUT</span>&#125;, is exceeded.<p>
Erase and kill processing occur when either of two special characters, the <span class="define">ERASE</span> and <span class="define">KILL</span> characters (see the <i class="link-sec"><a class="link-sec" href="#x5370656369616c2043686172616374657273">Special Characters</a></i> section), is received. This processing affects data in the input queue that has not yet been delimited by a newline <span class="define">NL</span>, <span class="define">EOF</span>, or <span class="define">EOL</span> character. This un-delimited data makes up the current line. The <span class="define">ERASE</span> character deletes the last character in the current line, if there is any. The <span class="define">KILL</span> character deletes all data in the current line, if there is any. The <span class="define">ERASE</span> and <span class="define">KILL</span> characters have no effect if there is no data in the current line. The <span class="define">ERASE</span> and <span class="define">KILL</span> characters themselves are not placed in the input queue.</div>

<h2 id="x4e6f6e63616e6f6e6963616c204d6f646520496e7075742050726f63657373696e67">Noncanonical Mode Input Processing</h2> In noncanonical mode input processing, input bytes are not assembled into lines, and erase and kill processing does not occur. The values of the <span class="define">VMIN</span> and <span class="define">VTIME</span> members of the <i class="farg">c_cc</i> array are used to determine how to process the bytes received.<p>
<span class="define">VMIN</span> represents the minimum number of bytes that should be received when the <a class="link-man" href="../2/read">read(2)</a> system call successfully returns. <span class="define">VTIME</span> is a timer of 0.1 second granularity that is used to time out bursty and short term data transmissions. If <span class="define">VMIN</span> is greater than &#123;<span class="define">MAX_INPUT</span>&#125;, the response to the request is undefined. The four possible values for <span class="define">VMIN</span> and <span class="define">VTIME</span> and their interactions are described below.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x4361736520413a20564d494e203e20302c205654494d45203e2030">Case A: VMIN &gt; 0, VTIME &gt; 0</h2> In this case <span class="define">VTIME</span> serves as an inter-byte timer and is activated after the first byte is received. Since it is an inter-byte timer, it is reset after a byte is received. The interaction between <span class="define">VMIN</span> and <span class="define">VTIME</span> is as follows:  as soon as one byte is received, the inter-byte timer is started. If <span class="define">VMIN</span> bytes are received before the inter-byte timer expires (remember that the timer is reset upon receipt of each byte), the read is satisfied. If the timer expires before <span class="define">VMIN</span> bytes are received, the characters received to that point are returned to the user. Note that if <span class="define">VTIME</span> expires at least one byte is returned because the timer would not have been enabled unless a byte was received. In this case (<span class="define">VMIN</span> &gt; 0, <span class="define">VTIME</span> &gt; 0) the read blocks until the <span class="define">VMIN</span> and <span class="define">VTIME</span> mechanisms are activated by the receipt of the first byte, or a signal is received. If data is in the buffer at the time of the <a class="link-man" href="../2/read">read(2)</a>, the result is as if data had been received immediately after the <a class="link-man" href="../2/read">read(2)</a>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x4361736520423a20564d494e203e20302c205654494d45203d2030">Case B: VMIN &gt; 0, VTIME = 0</h2> In this case, since the value of <span class="define">VTIME</span> is zero, the timer plays no role and only <span class="define">VMIN</span> is significant. A pending read is not satisfied until <span class="define">VMIN</span> bytes are received (i.e., the pending read blocks until <span class="define">VMIN</span> bytes are received), or a signal is received. A program that uses this case to read record-based terminal <span class="define">I/O</span> may block indefinitely in the read operation.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x4361736520433a20564d494e203d20302c205654494d45203e2030">Case C: VMIN = 0, VTIME &gt; 0</h2> In this case, since <span class="define">VMIN</span> = 0, <span class="define">VTIME</span> no longer represents an inter-byte timer. It now serves as a read timer that is activated as soon as the read function is processed. A read is satisfied as soon as a single byte is received or the read timer expires. Note that in this case if the timer expires, no bytes are returned. If the timer does not expire, the only way the read can be satisfied is if a byte is received. In this case the read will not block indefinitely waiting for a byte; if no byte is received within <span class="define">VTIME</span>*0.1 seconds after the read is initiated, the read returns a value of zero, having read no data. If data is in the buffer at the time of the read, the timer is started as if data had been received immediately after the read.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x4361736520443a20564d494e203d20302c205654494d45203d2030">Case D: VMIN = 0, VTIME = 0</h2> The minimum of either the number of bytes requested or the number of bytes currently available is returned without waiting for more bytes to be input. If no characters are available, read returns a value of zero, having read no data.</div>

The implementation may provide a buffering mechanism; as such, when a call to <a class="link-man" href="../2/write">write(2)</a> completes, all of the bytes written have been scheduled for transmission to the device, but the transmission will not necessarily have been completed.</div>

Special character on input and is recognized if the <span class="define">ICANON</span> flag is set. Erases the last word in the current line according to one of two algorithms. If the <span class="define">ALTWERASE</span> flag is not set, first any preceding whitespace is erased, and then the maximal sequence of non-whitespace characters. If <span class="define">ALTWERASE</span> is set, first any preceding whitespace is erased, and then the maximal sequence of alphabetic/underscores or non alphabetic/underscores. As a special case in this second algorithm, the first previous non-whitespace character is skipped in determining whether the preceding word is a sequence of alphabetic/underscores. This sounds confusing but turns out to be quite practical.</dd>

<p>
In the context of asynchronous serial data transmission, a break condition is defined as a sequence of zero-valued bits that continues for more than the time to send one byte. The entire sequence of zero-valued bits is interpreted as a single break condition, even if it continues for a time equivalent to more than one byte. In contexts other than asynchronous serial data transmission the definition of a break condition is implementation defined.<p>
If <span class="define">IGNBRK</span> is set, a break condition detected on input is ignored, that is, not put on the input queue and therefore not read by any process. If <span class="define">IGNBRK</span> is not set and <span class="define">BRKINT</span> is set, the break condition flushes the input and output queues and if the terminal is the controlling terminal of a foreground process group, the break condition generates a single <span class="define">SIGINT</span> signal to that foreground process group. If neither <span class="define">IGNBRK</span> nor <span class="define">BRKINT</span> is set, a break condition is read as a single &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;0</code>&#8217;, or if <span class="define">PARMRK</span> is set, as &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;377</code>&#8217;, &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;0</code>&#8217;, &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;0</code>&#8217;.<p>
If <span class="define">IGNPAR</span> is set, a byte with a framing or parity error (other than break) is ignored.<p>
If <span class="define">PARMRK</span> is set, and <span class="define">IGNPAR</span> is not set, a byte with a framing or parity error (other than break) is given to the application as the three-character sequence &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;377</code>&#8217;, &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;0</code>&#8217;, X, where &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;377</code>&#8217;, &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;0</code>&#8217; is a two-character flag preceding each sequence and X is the data of the character received in error. To avoid ambiguity in this case, if <span class="define">ISTRIP</span> is not set, a valid character of &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;377</code>&#8217; is given to the application as &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;377</code>&#8217;, &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;377</code>&#8217;. If neither <span class="define">PARMRK</span> nor <span class="define">IGNPAR</span> is set, a framing or parity error (other than break) is given to the application as a single character &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;0</code>&#8217;.<p>
If <span class="define">INPCK</span> is set, input parity checking is enabled. If <span class="define">INPCK</span> is not set, input parity checking is disabled, allowing output parity generation without input parity errors. Note that whether input parity checking is enabled or disabled is independent of whether parity detection is enabled or disabled (see <i class="link-sec"><a class="link-sec" href="#x436f6e74726f6c204d6f646573">Control Modes</a></i>). If parity detection is enabled but input parity checking is disabled, the hardware to which the terminal is connected recognizes the parity bit, but the terminal special file does not check whether this bit is set correctly or not.<p>
If <span class="define">ISTRIP</span> is set, valid input bytes are first stripped to seven bits, otherwise all eight bits are processed.<p>
If <span class="define">INLCR</span> is set, a received <span class="define">NL</span> character is translated into a <span class="define">CR</span> character. If <span class="define">IGNCR</span> is set, a received <span class="define">CR</span> character is ignored (not read). If <span class="define">IGNCR</span> is not set and <span class="define">ICRNL</span> is set, a received <span class="define">CR</span> character is translated into a <span class="define">NL</span> character.<p>
If <span class="define">IXON</span> is set, start/stop output control is enabled. A received <span class="define">STOP</span> character suspends output and a received <span class="define">START</span> character restarts output. If <span class="define">IXANY</span> is also set, then any character may restart output. When <span class="define">IXON</span> is set, <span class="define">START</span> and <span class="define">STOP</span> characters are not read, but merely perform flow control functions. When <span class="define">IXON</span> is not set, the <span class="define">START</span> and <span class="define">STOP</span> characters are read.<p>
If <span class="define">IXOFF</span> is set, start/stop input control is enabled. The system shall transmit one or more <span class="define">STOP</span> characters, which are intended to cause the terminal device to stop transmitting data, as needed to prevent the input queue from overflowing and causing the undefined behavior described in <i class="link-sec"><a class="link-sec" href="#x496e7075742050726f63657373696e6720616e642052656164696e672044617461">Input Processing and Reading Data</a></i>, and shall transmit one or more <span class="define">START</span> characters, which are intended to cause the terminal device to resume transmitting data, as soon as the device can continue transmitting data without risk of overflowing the input queue. The precise conditions under which <span class="define">STOP</span> and START characters are transmitted are implementation defined.<p>
If <span class="define">IMAXBEL</span> is set and the input queue is full, subsequent input shall cause an ASCII <span class="define">BEL</span> character to be transmitted to the output queue.<p>
The initial input control value after <a class="link-man" href="../2/open">open(2)</a> is implementation defined.</div>

<p>
The <span class="define">CSIZE</span> bits specify the byte size in bits for both transmission and reception. The <i class="farg">c_cflag</i> is masked with <span class="define">CSIZE</span> and compared with the values <span class="define">CS5</span>, <span class="define">CS6</span>, <span class="define">CS7</span>, or <span class="define">CS8</span>. This size does not include the parity bit, if any. If <span class="define">CSTOPB</span> is set, two stop bits are used, otherwise one stop bit. For example, at 110 baud, two stop bits are normally used.<p>
If <span class="define">CREAD</span> is set, the receiver is enabled. Otherwise, no character is received. Not all hardware supports this bit. In fact, this flag is pretty silly and if it were not part of the <b class="name">termios</b> specification it would be omitted.<p>
If <span class="define">PARENB</span> is set, parity generation and detection are enabled and a parity bit is added to each character. If parity is enabled, <span class="define">PARODD</span> specifies odd parity if set, otherwise even parity is used.<p>
If <span class="define">HUPCL</span> is set, the modem control lines for the port are lowered when the last process with the port open closes the port or the process terminates. The modem connection is broken.<p>
If <span class="define">CLOCAL</span> is set, a connection does not depend on the state of the modem status lines. If <span class="define">CLOCAL</span> is clear, the modem status lines are monitored.<p>
Under normal circumstances, a call to the <a class="link-man" href="../2/open">open(2)</a> function waits for the modem connection to complete. However, if the <span class="define">O_NONBLOCK</span> flag is set or if <span class="define">CLOCAL</span> has been set, the <a class="link-man" href="../2/open">open(2)</a> function returns immediately without waiting for the connection.<p>
If the <a class="link-man" href="../4/tty">tty(4)</a> <span class="define">TIOCFLAG_CLOCAL</span> flag has been set on the port then the <span class="define">CLOCAL</span> flag will automatically be set on every open.<p>
The <span class="define">CCTS_OFLOW</span> and <span class="define">CRTS_IFLOW</span> flags are currently unused. Only <span class="define">CRTSCTS</span>, which has the combined effect, is implemented. Note that <span class="define">CRTSCTS</span> support is hardware and driver dependent. Check the specific port driver manual page to see if hardware flow control is supported on the port you are using.<p>
If the <a class="link-man" href="../4/tty">tty(4)</a> <span class="define">TIOCFLAG_CRTSCTS</span> flag has been set on the port then the <span class="define">CRTSCTS</span> flag will automatically be set on every open.<p>
If <span class="define">MDMBUF</span> is set then output flow control is controlled by the state of Carrier Detect.<p>
If the <a class="link-man" href="../4/tty">tty(4)</a> <span class="define">TIOCFLAG_MDMBUF</span> flag has been set on the port then the <span class="define">MDMBUF</span> flag will automatically be set on every open.<p>
If the object for which the control modes are set is not an asynchronous serial connection, some of the modes may be ignored; for example, if an attempt is made to set the baud rate on a network connection to a terminal on another host, the baud rate may or may not be set on the connection between that terminal and the machine it is directly connected to.</div>

<p>
If <span class="define">ECHO</span> is set, input characters are echoed back to the terminal. If <span class="define">ECHO</span> is not set, input characters are not echoed.<p>
If <span class="define">ECHOE</span> and <span class="define">ICANON</span> are set, the <span class="define">ERASE</span> character causes the terminal to erase the last character in the current line from the display, if possible. If there is no character to erase, an implementation may echo an indication that this was the case or do nothing.<p>
If <span class="define">ECHOK</span> and <span class="define">ICANON</span> are set, the <span class="define">KILL</span> character causes the current line to be discarded and the system echoes the &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;n</code>&#8217; character after the <span class="define">KILL</span> character.<p>
If <span class="define">ECHOKE</span> and <span class="define">ICANON</span> are set, the <span class="define">KILL</span> character causes the current line to be discarded and the system causes the terminal to erase the line from the display.<p>
If <span class="define">ECHOPRT</span> and <span class="define">ICANON</span> are set, the system assumes that the display is a printing device and prints a backslash and the erased characters when processing <span class="define">ERASE</span> characters, followed by a forward slash.<p>
If <span class="define">ECHOCTL</span> is set, the system echoes control characters in a visible fashion using a caret followed by the control character.<p>
If <span class="define">ALTWERASE</span> is set, the system uses an alternative algorithm for determining what constitutes a word when processing <span class="define">WERASE</span> characters (see <span class="define">WERASE</span>).<p>
If <span class="define">ECHONL</span> and <span class="define">ICANON</span> are set, the &#8216;<code class="lit">&#92;n</code>&#8217; character echoes even if <span class="define">ECHO</span> is not set.<p>
If <span class="define">ICANON</span> is set, canonical processing is enabled. This enables the erase and kill edit functions, and the assembly of input characters into lines delimited by <span class="define">NL</span>, <span class="define">EOF</span>, and <span class="define">EOL</span>, as described in <i class="link-sec"><a class="link-sec" href="#x43616e6f6e6963616c204d6f646520496e7075742050726f63657373696e67">Canonical Mode Input Processing</a></i>.<p>
If <span class="define">ICANON</span> is not set, read requests are satisfied directly from the input queue. A read is not satisfied until at least <span class="define">VMIN</span> bytes have been received or the timeout value <span class="define">VTIME</span> expired between bytes. The time value represents tenths of seconds. See <i class="link-sec"><a class="link-sec" href="#x4e6f6e63616e6f6e6963616c204d6f646520496e7075742050726f63657373696e67">Noncanonical Mode Input Processing</a></i> for more details.<p>
If <span class="define">ISIG</span> is set, each input character is checked against the special control characters <span class="define">INTR</span>, <span class="define">QUIT</span>, and <span class="define">SUSP</span> (job control only). If an input character matches one of these control characters, the function associated with that character is performed. If <span class="define">ISIG</span> is not set, no checking is done. Thus these special input functions are possible only if <span class="define">ISIG</span> is set.<p>
If <span class="define">IEXTEN</span> is set, implementation-defined functions are recognized from the input data. How <span class="define">IEXTEN</span> being set interacts with <span class="define">ICANON</span>, <span class="define">ISIG</span>, <span class="define">IXON</span>, or <span class="define">IXOFF</span> is implementation defined. If <span class="define">IEXTEN</span> is not set, then implementation-defined functions are not recognized, and the corresponding input characters are not processed as described for <span class="define">ICANON</span>, <span class="define">ISIG</span>, <span class="define">IXON</span>, and <span class="define">IXOFF</span>.<p>
If <span class="define">NOFLSH</span> is set, the normal flush of the input and output queues associated with the <span class="define">INTR</span>, <span class="define">QUIT</span>, and <span class="define">SUSP</span> characters are not be done.<p>
If <span class="define">TOSTOP</span> is set, the signal <span class="define">SIGTTOU</span> is sent to the process group of a process that tries to write to its controlling terminal if it is not in the foreground process group for that terminal. This signal, by default, stops the members of the process group. Otherwise, the output generated by that process is output to the current output stream. Processes that are blocking or ignoring <span class="define">SIGTTOU</span> signals are excepted and allowed to produce output and the <span class="define">SIGTTOU</span> signal is not sent.<p>
If <span class="define">NOKERNINFO</span> is set, the kernel does not produce a status message when processing <span class="define">STATUS</span> characters (see <span class="define">STATUS</span>).</div>
