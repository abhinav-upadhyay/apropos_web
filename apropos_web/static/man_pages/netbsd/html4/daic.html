<h1 id="x4e414d45">NAME</h1> <b class="name">daic</b> &#8212; <span class="desc">isdn4bsd driver for EICON.Diehl active ISDN cards</span></div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x53594e4f50534953">SYNOPSIS</h1> <b class="config">daic0 at isa? iomem 0xd8000 irq 10</b></div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x4445534352495054494f4e">DESCRIPTION</h1> The <b class="name">daic</b> driver supports the old Diehl active cards: <span class="emph">S, SX, SXn, SCOM</span> and <span class="emph">QUADRO</span>.<p>
For a <span class="emph">QUADRO</span> card, the driver will detect the board type and use all four ports, each attached as a controller of its own to the isdn4bsd system, which can be listed using the daicctl utility.<p>
The <b class="name">daic</b> driver interfaces the ISDN card to the ISDN4BSD kernel subsystem. All lower layer ISDN control is handled by the card. This should allow you to run any national ISDN protocol delivered by EICON.Diehl for your card, but the driver has only been tested with the DSS1 protocol and some parts of the cards interface are ISDN protocol dependent.<p>
The <b class="name">daic</b> driver is written to conform to the software interface documented by Diehl in their <b class="name">ISDN-Karten Benutzerhandbuch</b> from 1992.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x4d4943524f434f444520444f574e4c4f4144">MICROCODE DOWNLOAD</h1> Every active card needs its own operating software before it can work. You have to download this to the card before using it with isdn4bsd. Use the daicctl utility to do this, i.e. call <b class="name">daicctl -d te_etsi.sx 1</b> to download the file <b class="name">te_etsi.sx</b> to controller number 1. Use <b class="name">daicctl -l</b> to list all available controllers (and ports). You have to select the correct ISDN protocol file for your ISDN interface, see the Diehl documentation for details.<p>
The cards bootstrap process involves another file, which is independent of the card type you use and the protocol you run. It is called <b class="name">download.bin</b> in current versions of the Diehl software distribution and has to be copied to the kernel compile directory under <b class="name">dev/microcode/daic</b> and converted into a header file used when compiling the kernel by running <b class="name">make</b> in that directory. Your kernel compile will fail and remind you of this if you forget to do this. Due to copyright restrictions we cannot distribute the driver with this file integrated. But if you own a card, you do have the file (or can get it from the Diehl web server).</div>
