<h1>NAME</h1> ld &#45; The GNU linker</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> ld [ <b>options</b>] <i>objfile</i> ...</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <b>ld</b> combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in compiling a program is to run  <b>ld</b>.<p>
<b>ld</b> accepts Linker Command Language files written in a superset of AT&amp;T's Link Editor Command Language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.<p>
This man page does not describe the command language; see the  <b>ld</b> entry in "info" for full details on the command language and on other aspects of the GNU linker.<p>
This version of <b>ld</b> uses the general purpose BFD libraries to operate on object files. This allows  <b>ld</b> to read, combine, and write object files in many different formats&#45;&#45;&#45;for example, COFF or "a.out".  Different formats may be linked together to produce any available kind of object file.<p>
Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful than other linkers in providing diagnostic information.  Many linkers abandon execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible,  <b>ld</b> continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors (or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).<p>
The GNU linker <b>ld</b> is meant to cover a broad range of situations, and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers.  As a result, you have many choices to control its behavior.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual practice few of them are used in any particular context. For instance, a frequent use of  <b>ld</b> is to link standard Unix object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to link a file "hello.o":<p>
<br>
        ld &#45;o &lt;output&gt; /lib/crt0.o hello.o &#45;lc<br>
<p>
This tells <b>ld</b> to produce a file called <i>output</i> as the result of linking the file "/lib/crt0.o" with "hello.o" and the library "libc.a", which will come from the standard search directories.  (See the discussion of the  <b>&#45;l</b> option below.)<p>
Some of the command-line options to <b>ld</b> may be specified at any point in the command line.  However, options which refer to files, such as  <b>&#45;l</b> or <b>&#45;T</b>, cause the file to be read at the point at which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object files and other file options.  Repeating non-file options with a different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that option.  Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are noted in the descriptions below.<p>
Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked together.  They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between an option and its argument.<p>
Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can specify other forms of binary input files using  <b>&#45;l</b>, <b>&#45;R</b>, and the script command language.  If  <i>no</i> binary input files at all are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the message  <b>No input files</b>.<p>
If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default linker script or the one specified by using  <b>&#45;T</b>).  This feature permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses "INPUT" or "GROUP" to load other objects.  Specifying a script in this way merely augments the main linker script, with the extra commands placed after the main script; use the  <b>&#45;T</b> option to replace the default linker script entirely, but note the effect of the "INSERT" command.<p>
For options whose names are a single letter, option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the option that requires them.<p>
For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can precede the option name; for example,  <b>&#45;trace&#45;symbol</b> and  <b>&#45;&#45;trace&#45;symbol</b> are equivalent.  Note&#45;&#45;&#45;there is one exception to this rule.  Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can only be preceded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion with the  <b>&#45;o</b> option.  So for example <b>&#45;omagic</b> sets the output file name to  <b>magic</b> whereas <b>&#45;&#45;omagic</b> sets the NMAGIC flag on the output.<p>
Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the option that requires them.  For example,  <b>&#45;&#45;trace&#45;symbol foo</b> and <b>&#45;&#45;trace&#45;symbol=foo</b> are equivalent. Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are accepted.<p>
Note&#45;&#45;&#45;if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver (e.g.  <b>gcc</b>) then all the linker command line options should be prefixed by  <b>&#45;Wl,</b> (or whatever is appropriate for the particular compiler driver) like this:<p>
<br>
          gcc &#45;Wl,&#45;&#45;start&#45;group foo.o bar.o &#45;Wl,&#45;&#45;end&#45;group<br>
<p>
This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link.  Confusion may also arise when passing options that require values through a driver, as the use of a space between option and argument acts as a separator, and causes the driver to pass only the option to the linker and the argument to the compiler.  In this case, it is simplest to use the joined forms of both single&#45; and multiple-letter options, such as:<p>
<br>
          gcc foo.o bar.o &#45;Wl,&#45;eENTRY &#45;Wl,&#45;Map=a.map<br>
<p>
Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the GNU linker:<dl>
<dt>
<b>@</b><i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
Read command-line options from <i>file</i>.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @ <i>file</i> option.  If <i>file</i> does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not removed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Options in <i>file</i> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The  <i>file</i> may itself contain additional @ <i>file</i> options; any such options will be processed recursively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;a</b> <i>keyword</i></dt>
<dd>
This option is supported for HP/UX compatibility.  The <i>keyword</i> argument must be one of the strings  <b>archive</b>, <b>shared</b>, or  <b>default</b>.  <b>&#45;aarchive</b> is functionally equivalent to  <b>&#45;Bstatic</b>, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent to  <b>&#45;Bdynamic</b>.  This option may be used any number of times.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;audit</b> <i>AUDITLIB</i></dt>
<dd>
Adds <i>AUDITLIB</i> to the "DT_AUDIT" entry of the dynamic section.  <i>AUDITLIB</i> is not checked for existence, nor will it use the DT_SONAME specified in the library.  If specified multiple times "DT_AUDIT" will contain a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use. If the linker finds an object with an audit entry while searching for shared libraries, it will add a corresponding "DT_DEPAUDIT" entry in the output file. This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms supporting the rtld-audit interface.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;A</b> <i>architecture</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;architecture=</b><i>architecture</i></dt>
<dd>
In the current release of <b>ld</b>, this option is useful only for the Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that  <b>ld</b> configuration, the  <i>architecture</i> argument identifies the particular architecture in the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the archive-library search path.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Future releases of <b>ld</b> may support similar functionality for other architecture families.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;b</b> <i>input-format</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;format=</b><i>input-format</i></dt>
<dd>
<b>ld</b> may be configured to support more than one kind of object file.  If your  <b>ld</b> is configured this way, you can use the  <b>&#45;b</b> option to specify the binary format for input object files that follow this option on the command line.  Even when  <b>ld</b> is configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need to specify this, as  <b>ld</b> should be configured to expect as a default input format the most usual format on each machine.  <i>input-format</i> is a text string, the name of a particular format supported by the BFD libraries.  (You can list the available binary formats with  <b>objdump &#45;i</b>.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual binary format.  You can also use  <b>&#45;b</b> to switch formats explicitly (when linking object files of different formats), by including  <b>&#45;b</b> <i>input-format</i> before each group of object files in a particular format.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The default format is taken from the environment variable "GNUTARGET".<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can also define the input format from a script, using the command "TARGET";</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;c</b> <i>MRI-commandfile</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;mri&#45;script=</b><i>MRI-commandfile</i></dt>
<dd>
For compatibility with linkers produced by MRI, <b>ld</b> accepts script files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in the MRI Compatible Script Files section of GNU ld documentation. Introduce MRI script files with the option  <b>&#45;c</b>; use the <b>&#45;T</b> option to run linker scripts written in the general-purpose  <b>ld</b> scripting language. If  <i>MRI-cmdfile</i> does not exist, <b>ld</b> looks for it in the directories specified by any  <b>&#45;L</b> options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;d</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;dc</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;dp</b></dt>
<dd>
These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for compatibility with other linkers.  They assign space to common symbols even if a relocatable output file is specified (with  <b>&#45;r</b>).  The script command "FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION" has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;depaudit</b> <i>AUDITLIB</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;P</b> <i>AUDITLIB</i></dt>
<dd>
Adds <i>AUDITLIB</i> to the "DT_DEPAUDIT" entry of the dynamic section.  <i>AUDITLIB</i> is not checked for existence, nor will it use the DT_SONAME specified in the library.  If specified multiple times "DT_DEPAUDIT" will contain a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use.  This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms supporting the rtld-audit interface. The &#45;P option is provided for Solaris compatibility.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;e</b> <i>entry</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;entry=</b><i>entry</i></dt>
<dd>
Use <i>entry</i> as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol named  <i>entry</i>, the linker will try to parse <i>entry</i> as a number, and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in base 10; you may use a leading  <b>0x</b> for base 16, or a leading  <b>0</b> for base 8).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;exclude&#45;libs</b> <i>lib</i><b>,</b><i>lib</i><b>,...</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols should not be automatically exported.  The library names may be delimited by commas or colons.  Specifying "&#45;&#45;exclude&#45;libs ALL" excludes symbols in all archive libraries from automatic export.  This option is available only for the i386 PE targeted port of the linker and for ELF targeted ports.  For i386 PE, symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported, regardless of this option.  For ELF targeted ports, symbols affected by this option will be treated as hidden.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;exclude&#45;modules&#45;for&#45;implib</b> <i>module</i><b>,</b><i>module</i><b>,...</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies a list of object files or archive members, from which symbols should not be automatically exported, but which should be copied wholesale into the import library being generated during the link.  The module names may be delimited by commas or colons, and must match exactly the filenames used by  <b>ld</b> to open the files; for archive members, this is simply the member name, but for object files the name listed must include and match precisely any path used to specify the input file on the linker's command-line.  This option is available only for the i386 PE targeted port of the linker.  Symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported, regardless of this option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;E</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;export&#45;dynamic</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;export&#45;dynamic</b></dt>
<dd>
When creating a dynamically linked executable, using the <b>&#45;E</b> option or the  <b>&#45;&#45;export&#45;dynamic</b> option causes the linker to add all symbols to the dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you do not use either of these options (or use the  <b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;export&#45;dynamic</b> option to restore the default behavior), the dynamic symbol table will normally contain only those symbols which are referenced by some dynamic object mentioned in the link.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you use "dlopen" to load a dynamic object which needs to refer back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when linking the program itself.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can also use the dynamic list to control what symbols should be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it. See the description of  <b>&#45;&#45;dynamic&#45;list</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that this option is specific to ELF targeted ports.  PE targets support a similar function to export all symbols from a DLL or EXE; see the description of  <b>&#45;&#45;export&#45;all&#45;symbols</b> below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;EB</b></dt>
<dd>
Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;EL</b></dt>
<dd>
Link little-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;f</b> <i>name</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;auxiliary=</b><i>name</i></dt>
<dd>
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY field to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the symbol table of the shared object  <i>name</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you run the program, the dynamic linker will see the DT_AUXILIARY field.  If the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it will first check whether there is a definition in the shared object  <i>name</i>.  If there is one, it will be used instead of the definition in the filter object.  The shared object  <i>name</i> need not exist. Thus the shared object  <i>name</i> may be used to provide an alternative implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for machine specific performance.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This option may be specified more than once.  The DT_AUXILIARY entries will be created in the order in which they appear on the command line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;F</b> <i>name</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;filter=</b><i>name</i></dt>
<dd>
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_FILTER field to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter on the symbol table of the shared object  <i>name</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you run the program, the dynamic linker will see the DT_FILTER field.  The dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol table of the filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions found in the shared object  <i>name</i>.  Thus the filter object can be used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the object  <i>name</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Some older linkers used the <b>&#45;F</b> option throughout a compilation toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output object files. The GNU linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the  <b>&#45;b</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;format</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;oformat</b> options, the "TARGET" command in linker scripts, and the "GNUTARGET" environment variable. The GNU linker will ignore the  <b>&#45;F</b> option when not creating an ELF shared object.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;fini=</b><i>name</i></dt>
<dd>
When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting DT_FINI to the address of the function.  By default, the linker uses "_fini" as the function to call.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;g</b></dt>
<dd>
Ignored.  Provided for compatibility with other tools.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;G</b> <i>value</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;gpsize=</b><i>value</i></dt>
<dd>
Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register to  <i>size</i>.  This is only meaningful for object file formats such as MIPS ECOFF which supports putting large and small objects into different sections.  This is ignored for other object file formats.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;h</b> <i>name</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;soname=</b><i>name</i></dt>
<dd>
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object which has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;i</b></dt>
<dd>
Perform an incremental link (same as option <b>&#45;r</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;init=</b><i>name</i></dt>
<dd>
When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the executable or shared object is loaded, by setting DT_INIT to the address of the function.  By default, the linker uses "_init" as the function to call.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;l</b> <i>namespec</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;library=</b><i>namespec</i></dt>
<dd>
Add the archive or object file specified by <i>namespec</i> to the list of files to link.  This option may be used any number of times. If  <i>namespec</i> is of the form <i>:</i><i>filename</i><i></i>, <b>ld</b> will search the library path for a file called  <i>filename</i>, otherwise it will search the library path for a file called  <i>lib</i><i>namespec</i><i>.a</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On systems which support shared libraries, <b>ld</b> may also search for files other than  <i>lib</i><i>namespec</i><i>.a</i>.  Specifically, on ELF and SunOS systems,  <b>ld</b> will search a directory for a library called  <i>lib</i><i>namespec</i><i>.so</i> before searching for one called  <i>lib</i><i>namespec</i><i>.a</i>.  (By convention, a ".so" extension indicates a shared library.)  Note that this behavior does not apply to  <i>:</i><i>filename</i><i></i>, which always specifies a file called  <i>filename</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a symbol which was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the command line, the linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on the command line will not cause the linker to search the archive again.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See the <b>&#45;(</b> option for a way to force the linker to search archives multiple times.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However, if you are using  <b>ld</b> on AIX, note that it is different from the behaviour of the AIX linker.</dd>

<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;library&#45;path=</b><i>searchdir</i></dt>
<dd>
Add path <i>searchdir</i> to the list of paths that <b>ld</b> will search for archive libraries and  <b>ld</b> control scripts.  You may use this option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order in which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified on the command line are searched before the default directories.  All  <b>&#45;L</b> options apply to all <b>&#45;l</b> options, regardless of the order in which the options appear.   <b>&#45;L</b> options do not affect how  <b>ld</b> searches for a linker script unless <b>&#45;T</b> option is specified.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If <i>searchdir</i> begins with "=", then the "=" will be replaced by the  <i>sysroot prefix</i>, a path specified when the linker is configured.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The default set of paths searched (without being specified with  <b>&#45;L</b>) depends on which emulation mode <b>ld</b> is using, and in some cases also on how it was configured.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The paths can also be specified in a link script with the "SEARCH_DIR" command.  Directories specified this way are searched at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;m</b> <i>emulation</i></dt>
<dd>
Emulate the <i>emulation</i> linker.  You can list the available emulations with the  <b>&#45;&#45;verbose</b> or <b>&#45;V</b> options.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the <b>&#45;m</b> option is not used, the emulation is taken from the "LDEMULATION" environment variable, if that is defined.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was configured.</dd>

<b>&#45;M</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;print&#45;map</b></dt>
<dd>
Print a link map to the standard output.  A link map provides information about the link, including the following:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Where object files are mapped into memory.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
How common symbols are allocated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
All archive members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol which caused the archive member to be brought in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The values assigned to symbols.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note &#45; symbols whose values are computed by an expression which involves a reference to a previous value of the same symbol may not have correct result displayed in the link map.  This is because the linker discards intermediate results and only retains the final value of an expression.  Under such circumstances the linker will display the final value enclosed by square brackets.  Thus for example a linker script containing:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
           foo = 1<br>
           foo = foo * 4<br>
           foo = foo + 8<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
will produce the following output in the link map if the <b>&#45;M</b> option is used:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
           0x00000001                foo = 0x1<br>
           [0x0000000c]                foo = (foo * 0x4)<br>

<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;omagic</b></dt>
<dd>
This option negates most of the effects of the <b>&#45;N</b> option.  It sets the text section to be read-only, and forces the data segment to be page-aligned.  Note &#45; this option does not enable linking against shared libraries.  Use  <b>&#45;Bdynamic</b> for this.</dd>

Use <i>output</i> as the name for the program produced by <b>ld</b>; if this option is not specified, the name  <i>a.out</i> is used by default.  The script command "OUTPUT" can also specify the output file name.</dd>

If <i>level</i> is a numeric values greater than zero <b>ld</b> optimizes the output.  This might take significantly longer and therefore probably should only be enabled for the final binary.

<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;relocatable</b></dt>
<dd>
Generate relocatable output&#45;&#45;&#45;i.e., generate an output file that can in turn serve as input to  <b>ld</b>.  This is often called <i>partial</i>  <i>linking</i>.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to "OMAGIC". If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.  When linking C++ programs, this option  <i>will not</i> resolve references to constructors; to do that, use  <b>&#45;Ur</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When an input file does not have the same format as the output file, partial linking is only supported if that input file does not contain any relocations.  Different output formats can have further restrictions; for example some "a.out"&#45;based formats do not support partial linking with input files in other formats at all.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Use <i>scriptfile</i> as the linker script.

&#160;</div>
This option is similar to the <b>&#45;&#45;script</b> option except that processing of the script is delayed until after the rest of the command line has been processed.  This allows options placed after the  <b>&#45;&#45;default&#45;script</b> option on the command line to affect the behaviour of the linker script, which can be important when the linker command line cannot be directly controlled by the user.

Force <i>symbol</i> to be entered in the output file as an undefined symbol.

For anything other than C++ programs, this option is equivalent to  <b>&#45;r</b>: it generates relocatable output&#45;&#45;&#45;i.e., an output file that can in turn serve as input to  <b>ld</b>.  When linking C++ programs, <b>&#45;Ur</b>  <i>does</i> resolve references to constructors, unlike <b>&#45;r</b>. It does not work to use  <b>&#45;Ur</b> on files that were themselves linked with  <b>&#45;Ur</b>; once the constructor table has been built, it cannot be added to.

The <i>archives</i> should be a list of archive files.  They may be either explicit file names, or  <b>&#45;l</b> options.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The specified archives are searched repeatedly until no new undefined references are created.  Normally, an archive is searched only once in the order that it is specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that archive is needed to resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an object in an archive that appears later on the command line, the linker would not be able to resolve that reference.  By grouping the archives, they all be searched repeatedly until all possible references are resolved.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Tells the linker to accept input files whose architecture cannot be recognised.  The assumption is that the user knows what they are doing and deliberately wants to link in these unknown input files.  This was the default behaviour of the linker, before release 2.14.  The default behaviour from release 2.14 onwards is to reject such input files, and so the  <b>&#45;&#45;accept&#45;unknown&#45;input&#45;arch</b> option has been added to restore the old behaviour.</dd>

This option affects ELF DT_NEEDED tags for dynamic libraries mentioned on the command line after the  <b>&#45;&#45;as&#45;needed</b> option.  Normally the linker will add a DT_NEEDED tag for each dynamic library mentioned on the command line, regardless of whether the library is actually needed or not.   <b>&#45;&#45;as&#45;needed</b> causes a DT_NEEDED tag to only be emitted for a library that satisfies an undefined symbol reference from a regular object file or, if the library is not found in the DT_NEEDED lists of other libraries linked up to that point, an undefined symbol reference from another dynamic library.  <b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;as&#45;needed</b> restores the default behaviour.</dd>

<dd>
Asks the linker <i>not</i> to check section addresses after they have been assigned to see if there are any overlaps.  Normally the linker will perform this check, and if it finds any overlaps it will produce suitable error messages.  The linker does know about, and does make allowances for sections in overlays.  The default behaviour can be restored by using the command line switch  <b>&#45;&#45;check&#45;sections</b>. Section overlap is not usually checked for relocatable links.  You can force checking in that case by using the  <b>&#45;&#45;check&#45;sections</b> option.</dd>

<b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;copy&#45;dt&#45;needed&#45;entries</b></dt>
<dd>
This option affects the treatment of dynamic libraries referred to by DT_NEEDED tags  <i>inside</i> ELF dynamic libraries mentioned on the command line.  Normally the linker won't add a DT_NEEDED tag to the output binary for each library mentioned in a DT_NEEDED tag in an input dynamic library.  With  <b>&#45;&#45;copy&#45;dt&#45;needed&#45;entries</b> specified on the command line however any dynamic libraries that follow it will have their DT_NEEDED entries added.  The default behaviour can be restored with  <b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;copy&#45;dt&#45;needed&#45;entries</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This option also has an effect on the resolution of symbols in dynamic libraries.  With  <b>&#45;&#45;copy&#45;dt&#45;needed&#45;entries</b> dynamic libraries mentioned on the command line will be recursively searched, following their DT_NEEDED tags to other libraries, in order to resolve symbols required by the output binary.  With the default setting however the searching of dynamic libraries that follow it will stop with the dynamic library itself.  No DT_NEEDED links will be traversed to resolve symbols.</dd>

<dd>
Output a cross reference table.  If a linker map file is being generated, the cross reference table is printed to the map file. Otherwise, it is printed on the standard output.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it may be easily processed by a script if necessary.  The symbols are printed out, sorted by name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is given.  If the symbol is defined, the first file listed is the location of the definition.  The remaining files contain references to the symbol.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;define&#45;common</b></dt>
<dd>
This option inhibits the assignment of addresses to common symbols. The script command "INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION" has the same effect.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;define&#45;common</b> option allows decoupling the decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the choice of the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type forces assigning addresses to Common symbols. Using  <b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;define&#45;common</b> allows Common symbols that are referenced from a shared library to be assigned addresses only in the main program. This eliminates the unused duplicate space in the shared library, and also prevents any possible confusion over resolving to the wrong duplicate when there are many dynamic modules with specialized search paths for runtime symbol resolution.</dd>

Create a global symbol in the output file, containing the absolute address given by  <i>expression</i>.  You may use this option as many times as necessary to define multiple symbols in the command line.  A limited form of arithmetic is supported for the  <i>expression</i> in this context: you may give a hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing symbol, or use "+" and "&#45;" to add or subtract hexadecimal constants or symbols.  If you need more elaborate expressions, consider using the linker command language from a script.   <i>Note:</i> there should be no white space between  <i>symbol</i>, the equals sign ("<b>=</b>"), and  <i>expression</i>.</dd>

<b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;demangle</b></dt>
<dd>
These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error messages and other output.  When the linker is told to demangle, it tries to present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts C++ mangled symbol names into user readable names.  Different compilers have different mangling styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be used to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.  The linker will demangle by default unless the environment variable  <b>COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE</b> is set.  These options may be used to override the default.</dd>

If a successfully built fully linked output file does not have a ".exe" or ".dll" suffix, this option forces the linker to copy the output file to one of the same name with a ".exe" suffix.

Enable garbage collection of unused input sections.  It is ignored on targets that do not support this option.  The default behaviour (of not performing this garbage collection) can be restored by specifying  <b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;gc&#45;sections</b> on the command line.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>&#45;&#45;gc&#45;sections</b> decides which input sections are used by examining symbols and relocations.  The section containing the entry symbol and all sections containing symbols undefined on the command-line will be kept, as will sections containing symbols referenced by dynamic objects.  Note that when building shared libraries, the linker must assume that any visible symbol is referenced.  Once this initial set of sections has been determined, the linker recursively marks as used any section referenced by their relocations.  See  <b>&#45;&#45;entry</b> and <b>&#45;&#45;undefined</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This option can be set when doing a partial link (enabled with option  <b>&#45;r</b>).  In this case the root of symbols kept must be explicitly specified either by an  <b>&#45;&#45;entry</b> or <b>&#45;&#45;undefined</b> option or by a "ENTRY" command in the linker script.</dd>

Allows or disallows undefined symbols in shared libraries. This switch is similar to  <b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;undefined</b> except that it determines the behaviour when the undefined symbols are in a shared library rather than a regular object file.  It does not affect how undefined symbols in regular object files are handled.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The default behaviour is to report errors for any undefined symbols referenced in shared libraries if the linker is being used to create an executable, but to allow them if the linker is being used to create a shared library.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The reasons for allowing undefined symbol references in shared libraries specified at link time are that:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A shared library specified at link time may not be the same as the one that is available at load time, so the symbol might actually be resolvable at load time.</dd>
</dl>

<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
There are some operating systems, eg BeOS and HPPA, where undefined symbols in shared libraries are normal.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The BeOS kernel for example patches shared libraries at load time to select whichever function is most appropriate for the current architecture.  This is used, for example, to dynamically select an appropriate memset function.</dd>

An option with machine dependent effects. This option is only supported on a few targets.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On some platforms the <b>&#45;&#45;relax</b> option performs target specific, global optimizations that become possible when the linker resolves addressing in the program, such as relaxing address modes, synthesizing new instructions, selecting shorter version of current instructions, and combinig constant values.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On some platforms these link time global optimizations may make symbolic debugging of the resulting executable impossible. This is known to be the case for the Matsushita MN10200 and MN10300 family of processors.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<b>&#45;rpath=</b><i>dir</i></dt>
<dd>
Add a directory to the runtime library search path.  This is used when linking an ELF executable with shared objects.  All  <b>&#45;rpath</b> arguments are concatenated and passed to the runtime linker, which uses them to locate shared objects at runtime.  The  <b>&#45;rpath</b> option is also used when locating shared objects which are needed by shared objects explicitly included in the link; see the description of the  <b>&#45;rpath&#45;link</b> option.  If <b>&#45;rpath</b> is not used when linking an ELF executable, the contents of the environment variable "LD_RUN_PATH" will be used if it is defined.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>&#45;rpath</b> option may also be used on SunOS.  By default, on SunOS, the linker will form a runtime search patch out of all the  <b>&#45;L</b> options it is given.  If a <b>&#45;rpath</b> option is used, the runtime search path will be formed exclusively using the  <b>&#45;rpath</b> options, ignoring the  <b>&#45;L</b> options.  This can be useful when using gcc, which adds many  <b>&#45;L</b> options which may be on NFS mounted file systems.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the <b>&#45;R</b> option is followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is treated as the  <b>&#45;rpath</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;rpath&#45;link=</b><i>dir</i></dt>
<dd>
When using ELF or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This happens when an "ld &#45;shared" link includes a shared library as one of the input files.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non-shared, non-relocatable link, it will automatically try to locate the required shared library and include it in the link, if it is not included explicitly.  In such a case, the  <b>&#45;rpath&#45;link</b> option specifies the first set of directories to search.  The  <b>&#45;rpath&#45;link</b> option may specify a sequence of directory names either by specifying a list of names separated by colons, or by appearing multiple times.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This option should be used with caution as it overrides the search path that may have been hard compiled into a shared library. In such a case it is possible to use unintentionally a different search path than the runtime linker would do.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The linker uses the following search paths to locate required shared libraries:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">

Any directories specified by <b>&#45;rpath</b> options.  The difference between  <b>&#45;rpath</b> and <b>&#45;rpath&#45;link</b> is that directories specified by  <b>&#45;rpath</b> options are included in the executable and used at runtime, whereas the  <b>&#45;rpath&#45;link</b> option is only effective at link time. Searching  <b>&#45;rpath</b> in this way is only supported by native linkers and cross linkers which have been configured with the  <b>&#45;&#45;with&#45;sysroot</b> option.</dd>

This is useful when generating huge relocatable files for downloading into certain real time kernels with the COFF object file format; since COFF cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.  Note that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split up individual input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section contains more than  <i>count</i> relocations one output section will contain that many relocations.   <i>count</i> defaults to a value of 32768.</dd>

For example, on SunOS, <b>ld</b> combines duplicate entries in the symbol string table.  This can reduce the size of an output file with full debugging information by over 30 percent.

Display the version number for <b>ld</b> and list the linker emulations supported.  Display which input files can and cannot be opened.  Display the linker script being used by the linker. If the optional  <i>NUMBER</i> argument &gt; 1, plugin symbol status will also be displayed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;version&#45;script=</b><i>version-scriptfile</i></dt>
<dd>
Specify the name of a version script to the linker.  This is typically used when creating shared libraries to specify additional information about the version hierarchy for the library being created.  This option is only fully supported on ELF platforms which support shared libraries; see  <b>VERSION</b>.  It is partially supported on PE platforms, which can use version scripts to filter symbol visibility in auto-export mode: any symbols marked  <b>local</b> in the version script will not be exported.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;warn&#45;common</b></dt>
<dd>
Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with a symbol definition.  Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practise, but linkers on some other operating systems do not.  This option allows you to find potential problems from combining global symbols. Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practise, so you may get some warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in your programs.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
<b>int i = 1;</b></dt>
<dd>
A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>extern int i;</b></dt>
<dd>
An undefined reference, which does not allocate space. There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the variable somewhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>int i;</b></dt>
<dd>
A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file. The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is a definition of the same variable.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>&#45;&#45;warn&#45;common</b> option can produce five kinds of warnings. Each warning consists of a pair of lines: the first describes the symbol just encountered, and the second describes the previous symbol encountered with the same name.  One or both of the two symbols will be a common symbol.<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>
<dd>
Turning a common symbol into a reference, because there is already a definition for the symbol.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: common of &#768;&lt;symbol&gt;'<br>

        &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: defined here<br>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2.</dt>
<dd>
Turning a common symbol into a reference, because a later definition for the symbol is encountered.  This is the same as the previous case, except that the symbols are encountered in a different order.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: definition of &#768;&lt;symbol&gt;'<br>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;warn&#45;constructors</b></dt>
<dd>
Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a few object file formats.  For formats like COFF or ELF, the linker can not detect the use of global constructors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;warn&#45;multiple&#45;gp</b></dt>
<dd>
Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file. This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha. Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16 bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;warn&#45;once</b></dt>
<dd>
Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module which refers to it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;warn&#45;section&#45;align</b></dt>
<dd>
Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of alignment.  Typically, the alignment will be set by an input section. The address will only be changed if it not explicitly specified; that is, if the "SECTIONS" command does not specify a start address for the section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;warn&#45;shared&#45;textrel</b></dt>
<dd>
Warn if the linker adds a DT_TEXTREL to a shared object.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;warn&#45;alternate&#45;em</b></dt>
<dd>
Warn if an object has alternate ELF machine code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;warn&#45;unresolved&#45;symbols</b></dt>
<dd>
If the linker is going to report an unresolved symbol (see the option  <b>&#45;&#45;unresolved&#45;symbols</b>) it will normally generate an error. This option makes it generate a warning instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;error&#45;unresolved&#45;symbols</b></dt>
<dd>
This restores the linker's default behaviour of generating errors when it is reporting unresolved symbols.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;whole&#45;archive</b></dt>
<dd>
For each archive mentioned on the command line after the  <b>&#45;&#45;whole&#45;archive</b> option, include every object file in the archive in the link, rather than searching the archive for the required object files.  This is normally used to turn an archive file into a shared library, forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared library.  This option may be used more than once.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know about this option, so you have to use  <b>&#45;Wl,&#45;whole&#45;archive</b>. Second, don't forget to use  <b>&#45;Wl,&#45;no&#45;whole&#45;archive</b> after your list of archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to your link and you may not want this flag to affect those as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;wrap=</b><i>symbol</i></dt>
<dd>
Use a wrapper function for <i>symbol</i>.  Any undefined reference to  <i>symbol</i> will be resolved to "__wrap_<i>symbol</i>".  Any undefined reference to "__real_ <i>symbol</i>" will be resolved to  <i>symbol</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The wrapper function should be called "__wrap_ <i>symbol</i>".  If it wishes to call the system function, it should call "__real_ <i>symbol</i>".<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Here is a trivial example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        void *<br>
        __wrap_malloc (size_t c)<br>
        {<br>
          printf ("malloc called with %zu&#92;n", c);<br>
          return __real_malloc (c);<br>
        }<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you link other code with this file using <b>&#45;&#45;wrap malloc</b>, then all calls to "malloc" will call the function "__wrap_malloc" instead.  The call to "__real_malloc" in "__wrap_malloc" will call the real "malloc" function.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You may wish to provide a "__real_malloc" function as well, so that links without the  <b>&#45;&#45;wrap</b> option will succeed.  If you do this, you should not put the definition of "__real_malloc" in the same file as "__wrap_malloc"; if you do, the assembler may resolve the call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to "malloc".</dd>

<b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;ld&#45;generated&#45;unwind&#45;info</b></dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;disable&#45;new&#45;dtags</b></dt>
<dd>
This linker can create the new dynamic tags in ELF. But the older ELF systems may not understand them. If you specify  <b>&#45;&#45;enable&#45;new&#45;dtags</b>, the dynamic tags will be created as needed. If you specify  <b>&#45;&#45;disable&#45;new&#45;dtags</b>, no new dynamic tags will be created. By default, the new dynamic tags are not created. Note that those options are only available for ELF systems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;hash&#45;size=</b><i>number</i></dt>
<dd>
Set the default size of the linker's hash tables to a prime number close to  <i>number</i>.  Increasing this value can reduce the length of time it takes the linker to perform its tasks, at the expense of increasing the linker's memory requirements.  Similarly reducing this value can reduce the memory requirements at the expense of speed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;hash&#45;style=</b><i>style</i></dt>
<dd>
Set the type of linker's hash table(s).  <i>style</i> can be either "sysv" for classic ELF ".hash" section, "gnu" for new style GNU ".gnu.hash" section or "both" for both the classic ELF ".hash" and new style GNU ".gnu.hash" hash tables.  The default is "sysv".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;reduce&#45;memory&#45;overheads</b></dt>
<dd>
This option reduces memory requirements at ld runtime, at the expense of linking speed.  This was introduced to select the old O(n^2) algorithm for link map file generation, rather than the new O(n) algorithm which uses about 40% more memory for symbol storage.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Another effect of the switch is to set the default hash table size to 1021, which again saves memory at the cost of lengthening the linker's run time.  This is not done however if the  <b>&#45;&#45;hash&#45;size</b> switch has been used.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>&#45;&#45;reduce&#45;memory&#45;overheads</b> switch may be also be used to enable other tradeoffs in future versions of the linker.</dd>

<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;build&#45;id=</b><i>style</i></dt>
<dd>
Request creation of ".note.gnu.build&#45;id" ELF note section. The contents of the note are unique bits identifying this linked file.   <i>style</i> can be "uuid" to use 128 random bits, "sha1" to use a 160&#45;bit SHA1 hash on the normative parts of the output contents, "md5" to use a 128&#45;bit MD5 hash on the normative parts of the output contents, or "0x <i>hexstring</i>" to use a chosen bit string specified as an even number of hexadecimal digits ("&#45;" and ":" characters between digit pairs are ignored).  If  <i>style</i> is omitted, "sha1" is used.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The "md5" and "sha1" styles produces an identifier that is always the same in an identical output file, but will be unique among all nonidentical output files.  It is not intended to be compared as a checksum for the file's contents.  A linked file may be changed later by other tools, but the build ID bit string identifying the original linked file does not change.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Passing "none" for <i>style</i> disables the setting from any "&#45;&#45;build&#45;id" options earlier on the command line.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The i386 PE linker supports the <b>&#45;shared</b> option, which causes the output to be a dynamically linked library (DLL) instead of a normal executable.  You should name the output "*.dll" when you use this option.  In addition, the linker fully supports the standard "*.def" files, which may be specified on the linker command line like an object file (in fact, it should precede archives it exports symbols from, to ensure that they get linked in, just like a normal object file).<p>
In addition to the options common to all targets, the i386 PE linker support additional command line options that are specific to the i386 PE target.  Options that take values may be separated from their values by either a space or an equals sign.<dl>

<dd>
The PE variants of the Coff object format add an extension that permits the use of section names longer than eight characters, the normal limit for Coff.  By default, these names are only allowed in object files, as fully-linked executable images do not carry the Coff string table required to support the longer names.  As a GNU extension, it is possible to allow their use in executable images as well, or to (probably pointlessly!) disallow it in object files, by using these two options.  Executable images generated with these long section names are slightly non-standard, carrying as they do a string table, and may generate confusing output when examined with non-GNU PE-aware tools, such as file viewers and dumpers.  However, GDB relies on the use of PE long section names to find Dwarf&#45;2 debug information sections in an executable image at runtime, and so if neither option is specified on the command-line,  <b>ld</b> will enable long section names, overriding the default and technically correct behaviour, when it finds the presence of debug information while linking an executable image and not stripping symbols. [This option is valid for all PE targeted ports of the linker]</dd>

<b>&#45;&#45;disable&#45;stdcall&#45;fixup</b></dt>
<dd>
If the link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it will attempt to do "fuzzy linking" by looking for another defined symbol that differs only in the format of the symbol name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will resolve that symbol by linking to the match.  For example, the undefined symbol "_foo" might be linked to the function "_foo@12", or the undefined symbol "_bar@16" might be linked to the function "_bar".  When the linker does this, it prints a warning, since it normally should have failed to link, but sometimes import libraries generated from third-party dlls may need this feature to be usable.  If you specify  <b>&#45;&#45;enable&#45;stdcall&#45;fixup</b>, this feature is fully enabled and warnings are not printed.  If you specify  <b>&#45;&#45;disable&#45;stdcall&#45;fixup</b>, this feature is disabled and such mismatches are considered to be errors.

If given, all global symbols in the objects used to build a DLL will be exported by the DLL.  Note that this is the default if there otherwise wouldn't be any exported symbols.  When symbols are explicitly exported via DEF files or implicitly exported via function attributes, the default is to not export anything else unless this option is given.  Note that the symbols "DllMain@12", "DllEntryPoint@0", "DllMainCRTStartup@12", and "impure_ptr" will not be automatically exported.  Also, symbols imported from other DLLs will not be re-exported, nor will symbols specifying the DLL's internal layout such as those beginning with "_head_" or ending with "_iname".  In addition, no symbols from "libgcc", "libstd++", "libmingw32", or "crtX.o" will be exported. Symbols whose names begin with "__rtti_" or "__builtin_" will not be exported, to help with C++ DLLs.  Finally, there is an extensive list of cygwin-private symbols that are not exported (obviously, this applies on when building DLLs for cygwin targets). These cygwin-excludes are: "_cygwin_dll_entry@12", "_cygwin_crt0_common@8", "_cygwin_noncygwin_dll_entry@12", "_fmode", "_impure_ptr", "cygwin_attach_dll", "cygwin_premain0", "cygwin_premain1", "cygwin_premain2", "cygwin_premain3", and "environ".

<dd>
When linking dynamically to a dll without an import library, search for "&lt;string&gt;&lt;basename&gt;.dll" in preference to "lib&lt;basename&gt;.dll". This behaviour allows easy distinction between DLLs built for the various "subplatforms": native, cygwin, uwin, pw, etc.  For instance, cygwin DLLs typically use "&#45;&#45;dll&#45;search&#45;prefix=cyg".

<b>&#45;&#45;enable&#45;auto&#45;import</b></dt>
<dd>
Do sophisticated linking of "_symbol" to "__imp__symbol" for DATA imports from DLLs, and create the necessary thunking symbols when building the import libraries with those DATA exports. Note: Use of the 'auto&#45;import' extension will cause the text section of the image file to be made writable. This does not conform to the PE-COFF format specification published by Microsoft.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note &#45; use of the 'auto&#45;import' extension will also cause read only data which would normally be placed into the .rdata section to be placed into the .data section instead.  This is in order to work around a problem with consts that is described here: http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004&#45;09/msg01101<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Using 'auto&#45;import' generally will 'just work' -- but sometimes you may see this message:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
"variable '&lt;var&gt;' can't be auto-imported. Please read the documentation for ld's "&#45;&#45;enable&#45;auto&#45;import" for details."<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only allow one).  Instances where this may occur include accesses to member fields of struct variables imported from a DLL, as well as using a constant index into an array variable imported from a DLL.  Any multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger this error condition.  However, regardless of the exact data type of the offending exported variable, ld will always detect it, issue the warning, and exit.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless of the data type of the exported variable:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
One way is to use &#45;&#45;enable&#45;runtime&#45;pseudo&#45;reloc switch. This leaves the task of adjusting references in your client code for runtime environment, so this method works only when runtime environment supports this feature.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable -- that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time.  For arrays, there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address) a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.  Thus:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        extern type extern_array[];<br>
        extern_array[1] &#45;&#45;&gt;<br>
           { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
or<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        extern type extern_array[];<br>
        extern_array[1] &#45;&#45;&gt;<br>
           { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For structs (and most other multiword data types) the only option is to make the struct itself (or the long long, or the ...) variable:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        extern struct s extern_struct;<br>
        extern_struct.field &#45;&#45;&gt;<br>
           { volatile struct s *t=&amp;extern_struct; t&#45;&gt;field }<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
or<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        extern long long extern_ll;<br>
        extern_ll &#45;&#45;&gt;<br>
          { volatile long long * local_ll=&amp;extern_ll; *local_ll }<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon 'auto&#45;import' for the offending symbol and mark it with "__declspec(dllimport)".  However, in practise that requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you are building a DLL, building client code that will link to the DLL, or merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Original:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        &#45;&#45;foo.h<br>
        extern int arr[];<br>
        &#45;&#45;foo.c<br>
        #include "foo.h"<br>
        void main(int argc, char **argv){<br>
          printf("%d&#92;n",arr[1]);<br>
        }<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Solution 1:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        &#45;&#45;foo.h<br>
        extern int arr[];<br>
        &#45;&#45;foo.c<br>
        #include "foo.h"<br>
        void main(int argc, char **argv){<br>
          /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */<br>
          volatile int *parr = arr;<br>
          printf("%d&#92;n",parr[1]);<br>
        }<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Solution 2:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        &#45;&#45;foo.h<br>
        /* Note: auto&#45;export is assumed (no __declspec(dllexport)) */<br>
        #if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) &amp;&amp; &#92;<br>
          !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))<br>
        #define FOO_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)<br>
        #else<br>
        #define FOO_IMPORT<br>
        #endif<br>
        extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];<br>
        &#45;&#45;foo.c<br>
        #include "foo.h"<br>
        void main(int argc, char **argv){<br>
          printf("%d&#92;n",arr[1]);<br>
        }<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface for the offending variables (e.g.  <i>set_foo()</i> and <i>get_foo()</i> accessor functions). [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</dd>

<div class="section">
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1> You can change the behaviour of  <b>ld</b> with the environment variables "GNUTARGET", "LDEMULATION" and "COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE".<p>
"GNUTARGET" determines the input-file object format if you don't use  <b>&#45;b</b> (or its synonym <b>&#45;&#45;format</b>).  Its value should be one of the BFD names for an input format.  If there is no "GNUTARGET" in the environment,  <b>ld</b> uses the natural format of the target. If "GNUTARGET" is set to "default" then BFD attempts to discover the input format by examining binary input files; this method often succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to specify object-file formats is unique.  However, the configuration procedure for BFD on each system places the conventional format for that system first in the search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.<p>
"LDEMULATION" determines the default emulation if you don't use the  <b>&#45;m</b> option.  The emulation can affect various aspects of linker behaviour, particularly the default linker script.  You can list the available emulations with the  <b>&#45;&#45;verbose</b> or <b>&#45;V</b> options.  If the  <b>&#45;m</b> option is not used, and the "LDEMULATION" environment variable is not defined, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was configured.<p>
Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols.  However, if "COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE" is set in the environment, then it will default to not demangling symbols.  This environment variable is used in a similar fashion by the "gcc" linker wrapper program.  The default may be overridden by the  <b>&#45;&#45;demangle</b> and <b>&#45;&#45;no&#45;demangle</b> options.</div>
