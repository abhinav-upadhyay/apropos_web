<h1>NAME</h1> ksh &#45; Public domain Korn shell</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>  <b>ksh</b> [ <b>&#177;abCefhikmnprsuvxX</b>] [<b>&#177;o</b> <i>option</i>] [ [ <b>&#45;c</b> <i>command-string</i> [<i>command-name</i>] | <b>&#45;s</b> | <i>file</i> ] [<i>argument</i> ...] ]</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <b>ksh</b> is a command interpreter that is intended for both interactive and shell script use. Its command language is a superset of the  <i>sh</i>(1) shell language.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Shell Startup</h2> The following options can be specified only on the command line:<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;c</b> <i>command-string</i></dt>
<dd>
the shell executes the command(s) contained in <i>command-string</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;i</b></dt>
<dd>
interactive mode &#8212; see below</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;l</b></dt>
<dd>
login shell &#8212; see below interactive mode &#8212; see below</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;s</b></dt>
<dd>
the shell reads commands from standard input; all non-option arguments are positional parameters</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;r</b></dt>
<dd>
restricted mode &#8212; see below</dd>
</dl>
<p>
In addition to the above, the options described in the <b>set</b> built-in command can also be used on the command line.<p>
If neither the <b>&#45;c</b> nor the <b>&#45;s</b> options are specified, the first non-option argument specifies the name of a file the shell reads commands from; if there are no non-option arguments, the shell reads commands from standard input. The name of the shell ( <i>i.e.</i>, the contents of the <b>$0</b>) parameter is determined as follows: if the  <b>&#45;c</b> option is used and there is a non-option argument, it is used as the name; if commands are being read from a file, the file is used as the name; otherwise the name the shell was called with ( <i>i.e.</i>, argv[0]) is used.<p>
A shell is <b>interactive</b> if the <b>&#45;i</b> option is used or if both standard input and standard error are attached to a tty. An interactive shell has job control enabled (if available), ignores the INT, QUIT and TERM signals, and prints prompts before reading input (see  <b>PS1</b> and <b>PS2</b> parameters). For non-interactive shells, the  <b>trackall</b> option is on by default (see  <b>set</b> command below).<p>
A shell is <b>restricted</b> if the <b>&#45;r</b> option is used or if either the basename of the name the shell is invoked with or the  <b>SHELL</b> parameter match the pattern *r*sh ( <i>e.g.</i>, rsh, rksh, rpdksh, <i>etc.</i>). The following restrictions come into effect after the shell processes any profile and  <b>$ENV</b> files:<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
the <b>cd</b> command is disabled</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
the <b>SHELL</b>, <b>ENV</b> and <b>PATH</b> parameters can't be changed</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
command names can't be specified with absolute or relative paths</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
the <b>&#45;p</b> option of the <b>command</b> built-in can't be used</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
redirections that create files can't be used (<i>i.e.</i>, <b>&gt;</b>,  <b>&gt;|</b>, <b>&gt;&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;&gt;</b>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>
A shell is <b>privileged</b> if the <b>&#45;p</b> option is used or if the real user-id or group-id does not match the effective user-id or group-id (see  <i>getuid</i>(2), <i>getgid</i>(2)). A privileged shell does not process $HOME/.profile nor the  <b>ENV</b> parameter (see below), instead the file /etc/suid_profile is processed. Clearing the privileged option causes the shell to set its effective user-id (group-id) to its real user-id (group-id).<p>
If the basename of the name the shell is called with (<i>i.e.</i>, argv[0]) starts with  <b>&#45;</b> or if the <b>&#45;l</b> option is used, the shell is assumed to be a login shell and the shell reads and executes the contents of  <b>/etc/profile</b>, <b>$HOME/.profile</b> and <b>$ENV</b> if they exist and are readable.<p>
If the <b>ENV</b> parameter is set when the shell starts (or, in the case of login shells, after any profiles are processed), its value is subjected to parameter, command, arithmetic and tilde substitution and the resulting file (if any) is read and executed. If the  <b>ENV</b> parameter is not set (and not null) the file <b>$HOME/.kshrc</b> is included (after the above mentioned substitutions have been performed).<p>
The exit status of the shell is 127 if the command file specified on the command line could not be opened, or non-zero if a fatal syntax error occurred during the execution of a script. In the absence of fatal errors, the exit status is that of the last command executed, or zero, if no command is executed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Command Syntax</h2> The shell begins parsing its input by breaking it into  <i>word</i>s. Words, which are sequences of characters, are delimited by unquoted  <i>white-space</i> characters (space, tab and newline) or <i>meta-characters</i> ( <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>(</b> and <b>)</b>). Aside from delimiting words, spaces and tabs are ignored, while newlines usually delimit commands. The meta-characters are used in building the following tokens:  <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&lt;&amp;</b>, <b>&lt;&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>&gt;&amp;</b>, <b>&gt;&gt;</b>, <i>etc.</i> are used to specify redirections (see Input/Output Redirection below);  <b>|</b> is used to create pipelines;  <b>|&amp;</b> is used to create co-processes (see Co-Processes below);  <b>;</b> is used to separate commands;  <b>&amp;</b> is used to create asynchronous pipelines;  <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> are used to specify conditional execution;  <b>;;</b> is used in <b>case</b> statements;  <b>((</b> .. <b>))</b> are used in arithmetic expressions; and lastly,  <b>(</b> .. <b>)</b> are used to create subshells.<p>
White-space and meta-characters can be quoted individually using backslash ( <b>&#92;</b>), or in groups using double (<b>"</b>) or single (<b>'</b>) quotes. Note that the following characters are also treated specially by the shell and must be quoted if they are to represent themselves:  <b>&#92;</b>, <b>"</b>, <b>'</b>, <b>#</b>, <b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, <b>~</b>, <b>{</b>,  <b>}</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>?</b> and <b>[</b>. The first three of these are the above mentioned quoting characters (see Quoting below);  <b>#</b>, if used at the beginning of a word, introduces a comment &#8212; everything after the  <b>#</b> up to the nearest newline is ignored;  <b>$</b> is used to introduce parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions (see Substitution below);  <b>`</b> introduces an old-style command substitution (see Substitution below);  <b>~</b> begins a directory expansion (see Tilde Expansion below);  <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> delimit <i>csh</i>(1) style alternations (see Brace Expansion below); and, finally,  <b>*</b>, <b>?</b> and <b>[</b> are used in file name generation (see File Name Patterns below).<p>
As words and tokens are parsed, the shell builds commands, of which there are two basic types:  <i>simple-commands</i>, typically programs that are executed, and  <i>compound-commands</i>, such as <b>for</b> and  <b>if</b> statements, grouping constructs and function definitions.<p>
A simple-command consists of some combination of parameter assignments (see Parameters below), input/output redirections (see Input/Output Redirections below), and command words; the only restriction is that parameter assignments come before any command words. The command words, if any, define the command that is to be executed and its arguments. The command may be a shell built-in command, a function or an  <i>external</i>  <i>command</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a separate executable file that is located using the  <b>PATH</b> parameter (see Command Execution below). Note that all command constructs have an  <i>exit status</i>: for external commands, this is related to the status returned by  <i>wait</i>(2) (if the command could not be found, the exit status is 127, if it could not be executed, the exit status is 126); the exit status of other command constructs (built-in commands, functions, compound-commands, pipelines, lists,  <i>etc.</i>) are all well defined and are described where the construct is described. The exit status of a command consisting only of parameter assignments is that of the last command substitution performed during the parameter assignment or zero if there were no command substitutions.<p>
Commands can be chained together using the <b>|</b> token to form  <i>pipelines</i>, in which the standard output of each command but the last is piped (see  <i>pipe</i>(2)) to the standard input of the following command. The exit status of a pipeline is that of its last command. A pipeline may be prefixed by the  <b>!</b> reserved word which causes the exit status of the pipeline to be logically complemented: if the original status was 0 the complemented status will be 1, and if the original status was not 0, then the complemented status will be 0.<p>
<i>Lists</i> of commands can be created by separating pipelines by any of the following tokens:  <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, <b>||</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>|&amp;</b> and <b>;</b>. The first two are for conditional execution:  <i>cmd1</i> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <i>cmd2</i> executes  <i>cmd2</i> only if the exit status of <i>cmd1</i> is zero;  <b>||</b> is the opposite &#8212; <i>cmd2</i> is executed only if the exit status of  <i>cmd1</i> is non-zero.  <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> have equal precedence which is higher than that of  <b>&amp;</b>, <b>|&amp;</b> and <b>;</b>, which also have equal precedence. The  <b>&amp;</b> token causes the preceding command to be executed asynchronously, that is, the shell starts the command, but does not wait for it to complete (the shell does keep track of the status of asynchronous commands &#8212; see Job Control below). When an asynchronous command is started when job control is disabled ( <i>i.e.</i>, in most scripts), the command is started with signals INT and QUIT ignored and with input redirected from /dev/null (however, redirections specified in the asynchronous command have precedence). The  <b>|&amp;</b> operator starts a <i>co-process</i> which is special kind of asynchronous process (see Co-Processes below). Note that a command must follow the  <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> operators, while a command need not follow  <b>&amp;</b>, <b>|&amp;</b> and <b>;</b>. The exit status of a list is that of the last command executed, with the exception of asynchronous lists, for which the exit status is 0.<p>
Compound commands are created using the following reserved words &#8212; these words are only recognized if they are unquoted and if they are used as the first word of a command ( <i>i.e.</i>, they can't be preceded by parameter assignments or redirections):<table class="tbl">

<b>Note:</b> Some shells (but not this one) execute control structure commands in a subshell when one or more of their file descriptors are redirected, so any environment changes inside them may fail. To be portable, the  <b>exec</b> statement should be used instead to redirect file descriptors before the control structure.<p>
In the following compound command descriptions, command lists (denoted as  <i>list</i>) that are followed by reserved words must end with a semi-colon, a newline or a (syntactically correct) reserved word. For example,<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<b>{ echo foo; echo bar; }</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>{ echo foo; echo bar&lt;newline&gt;}</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>{ { echo foo; echo bar; } }</b></div>
are all valid, but<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<b>{ echo foo; echo bar }</b></div>
is not.<dl>
<dt>
<b>(</b> <i>list</i> <b>)</b></dt>
<dd>
Execute <i>list</i> in a subshell. There is no implicit way to pass environment changes from a subshell back to its parent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>{</b> <i>list</i> <b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
Compound construct; <i>list</i> is executed, but not in a subshell. Note that  <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are reserved words, not meta-characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>case</b> <i>word</i> <b>in</b> [ [<b>(</b>] <i>pattern</i> [<b>|</b> <i>pattern</i>] ... <b>)</b> <i>list</i> <b>;;</b> ] ... <b>esac</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>case</b> statement attempts to match <i>word</i> against the specified  <i>pattern</i>s; the <i>list</i> associated with the first successfully matched pattern is executed. Patterns used in  <b>case</b> statements are the same as those used for file name patterns except that the restrictions regarding  <b>.</b> and <b>/</b> are dropped. Note that any unquoted space before and after a pattern is stripped; any space with a pattern must be quoted. Both the word and the patterns are subject to parameter, command, and arithmetic substitution as well as tilde substitution. For historical reasons, open and close braces may be used instead of  <b>in</b> and <b>esac</b> (<i>e.g.</i>, <b>case $foo { *) echo bar; }</b>). The exit status of a  <b>case</b> statement is that of the executed <i>list</i>; if no  <i>list</i> is executed, the exit status is zero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>for</b> <i>name</i> [ <b>in</b> <i>word</i> ... <i>term</i> ] <b>do</b> <i>list</i> <b>done</b></dt>
<dd>
where <i>term</i> is either a newline or a <b>;</b>. For each  <i>word</i> in the specified word list, the parameter <i>name</i> is set to the word and  <i>list</i> is executed. If  <b>in</b> is not used to specify a word list, the positional parameters ( <b>"$1"</b>, <b>"$2"</b>,  <i>etc.</i>) are used instead. For historical reasons, open and close braces may be used instead of  <b>do</b> and <b>done</b> (<i>e.g.</i>, <b>for i; { echo $i; }</b>). The exit status of a  <b>for</b> statement is the last exit status of  <i>list</i>; if <i>list</i> is never executed, the exit status is zero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>if</b> <i>list</i> <b>then</b> <i>list</i> [<b>elif</b> <i>list</i> <b>then</b> <i>list</i>] ... [<b>else</b> <i>list</i>] <b>fi</b></dt>
<dd>
If the exit status of the first <i>list</i> is zero, the second <i>list</i> is executed; otherwise the  <i>list</i> following the <b>elif</b>, if any, is executed with similar consequences. If all the lists following the  <b>if</b> and  <b>elif</b>s fail (<i>i.e.</i>, exit with non-zero status), the <i>list</i> following the  <b>else</b> is executed. The exit status of an  <b>if</b> statement is that of non-conditional  <i>list</i> that is executed; if no non-conditional  <i>list</i> is executed, the exit status is zero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>select</b> <i>name</i> [ <b>in</b> <i>word</i> ... <i>term</i> ] <b>do</b> <i>list</i> <b>done</b></dt>
<dd>
where <i>term</i> is either a newline or a <b>;</b>. The  <b>select</b> statement provides an automatic method of presenting the user with a menu and selecting from it. An enumerated list of the specified  <i>words</i> is printed on standard error, followed by a prompt ( <b>PS3</b>, normally `<b>#? </b>'). A number corresponding to one of the enumerated words is then read from standard input,  <i>name</i> is set to the selected word (or is unset if the selection is not valid),  <b>REPLY</b> is set to what was read (leading/trailing space is stripped), and  <i>list</i> is executed. If a blank line ( <i>i.e.</i>, zero or more <b>IFS</b> characters) is entered, the menu is re-printed without executing  <i>list</i>. When  <i>list</i> completes, the enumerated list is printed if <b>REPLY</b> is null, the prompt is printed and so on. This process is continues until an end-of-file is read, an interrupt is received or a break statement is executed inside the loop. If  <b>in</b> <i>word</i> <b>...</b> is omitted, the positional parameters are used ( <i>i.e.</i>, <b>"$1"</b>, <b>"$2"</b>, <i>etc.</i>). For historical reasons, open and close braces may be used instead of  <b>do</b> and <b>done</b> (<i>e.g.</i>, <b>select i; { echo $i; }</b>). The exit status of a  <b>select</b> statement is zero if a break statement is used to exit the loop, non-zero otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>until</b> <i>list</i> <b>do</b> <i>list</i> <b>done</b></dt>
<dd>
This works like <b>while</b>, except that the body is executed only while the exit status of the first  <i>list</i> is non-zero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>while</b> <i>list</i> <b>do</b> <i>list</i> <b>done</b></dt>
<dd>
A <b>while</b> is a prechecked loop. Its body is executed as often as the exit status of the first  <i>list</i> is zero. The exit status of a  <b>while</b> statement is the last exit status of the  <i>list</i> in the body of the loop; if the body is not executed, the exit status is zero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>function</b> <i>name</i> <b>{</b> <i>list</i> <b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
Defines the function <i>name</i>. See Functions below. Note that redirections specified after a function definition are performed whenever the function is executed, not when the function definition is executed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>name</i> <b>()</b> <i>command</i></dt>
<dd>
Mostly the same as <b>function</b>. See Functions below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>time</b> [ <b>-p</b> ] [ <i>pipeline</i> ]</dt>
<dd>
The <b>time</b> reserved word is described in the Command Execution section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>((</b> <i>expression</i> <b>))</b></dt>
<dd>
The arithmetic expression <i>expression</i> is evaluated; equivalent to  <b>let "</b><i>expression</i><b>"</b>. See Arithmetic Expressions and the  <b>let</b> command below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>[[</b> <i>expression</i> <b>]]</b></dt>
<dd>
Similar to the <b>test</b> and <b>[</b> ... <b>]</b> commands (described later), with the following exceptions:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Field splitting and file name generation are not performed on arguments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The <b>&#45;a</b> (and) and <b>&#45;o</b> (or) operators are replaced with  <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b>, respectively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Operators (<i>e.g.</i>, <b>&#45;f</b>, <b>=</b>, <b>!</b>, <i>etc.</i>) must be unquoted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The second operand of <b>!=</b> and <b>=</b> expressions are patterns ( <i>e.g.</i>, the comparison in  <b>[[ foobar = f*r ]]</b> succeeds).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
There are two additional binary operators: <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> which return true if their first string operand is less than, or greater than, their second string operand, respectively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The single argument form of  <b>test</b>, which tests if the argument has non-zero length, is not valid - explicit operators must always be used,  <i>e.g.</i>, instead of  <b>[</b> <i>str</i> <b>]</b> use  <b>[[ &#45;n </b><i>str</i><b> ]]</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions are performed as expressions are evaluated and lazy expression evaluation is used for the  <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> operators. This means that in the statement  <b>[[ -r foo &amp;&amp; $(&lt; foo) = b*r ]]</b> the  <b>$(&lt; foo)</b> is evaluated if and only if the file <b>foo</b> exists and is readable.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Quoting</h2> Quoting is used to prevent the shell from treating characters or words specially. There are three methods of quoting: First,  <b>&#92;</b> quotes the following character, unless it is at the end of a line, in which case both the  <b>&#92;</b> and the newline are stripped. Second, a single quote ( <b>'</b>) quotes everything up to the next single quote (this may span lines). Third, a double quote ( <b>"</b>) quotes all characters, except  <b>$</b>, <b>`</b> and <b>&#92;</b>, up to the next unquoted double quote.  <b>$</b> and <b>`</b> inside double quotes have their usual meaning (<i>i.e.</i>, parameter, command or arithmetic substitution) except no field splitting is carried out on the results of double-quoted substitutions. If a  <b>&#92;</b> inside a double-quoted string is followed by <b>&#92;</b>, <b>$</b>,  <b>`</b> or <b>"</b>, it is replaced by the second character; if it is followed by a newline, both the  <b>&#92;</b> and the newline are stripped; otherwise, both the  <b>&#92;</b> and the character following are unchanged.<p>
Note: An earlier version of ksh(1) changed the interpretation of sequences of the form  <b>"</b>...<b>`</b>...<b>&#92;"</b>...<b>`</b>..<b>"</b> according to whether or not POSIX mode was in effect. In the current implementation, the backslash in  <b>&#92;"</b> is seen and removed by the outer  <b>"</b>...<b>"</b>, so the backslash is not seen by the inner  <b>`</b>...<b>`</b>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Aliases</h2> There are two types of aliases: normal command aliases and tracked aliases. Command aliases are normally used as a short hand for a long or often used command. The shell expands command aliases ( <i>i.e.</i>, substitutes the alias name for its value) when it reads the first word of a command. An expanded alias is re-processed to check for more aliases. If a command alias ends in a space or tab, the following word is also checked for alias expansion. The alias expansion process stops when a word that is not an alias is found, when a quoted word is found or when an alias word that is currently being expanded is found.<p>
The following command aliases are defined automatically by the shell:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
autoload='typeset &#45;fu'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
functions='typeset &#45;f'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
hash='alias &#45;t'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
history='fc &#45;l'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
integer='typeset &#45;i'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
local='typeset'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
login='exec login'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
nohup='nohup '<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
r='fc &#45;e &#45;'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
stop='kill &#45;STOP'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
suspend='kill &#45;STOP $$'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
type='whence &#45;v'</div>
<p>
Tracked aliases allow the shell to remember where it found a particular command. The first time the shell does a path search for a command that is marked as a tracked alias, it saves the full path of the command. The next time the command is executed, the shell checks the saved path to see that it is still valid, and if so, avoids repeating the path search. Tracked aliases can be listed and created using  <b>alias &#45;t</b>. Note that changing the  <b>PATH</b> parameter clears the saved paths for all tracked aliases. If the  <b>trackall</b> option is set (<i>i.e.</i>,  <b>set &#45;o trackall</b> or <b>set &#45;h</b>), the shell tracks all commands. This option is set automatically for non-interactive shells. For interactive shells, only the following commands are automatically tracked:  <b>cat</b>, <b>cc</b>, <b>chmod</b>, <b>cp</b>, <b>date</b>, <b>ed</b>,  <b>emacs</b>, <b>grep</b>, <b>ls</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>make</b>, <b>mv</b>,  <b>pr</b>, <b>rm</b>, <b>sed</b>, <b>sh</b>, <b>vi</b> and <b>who</b>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Substitution</h2> The first step the shell takes in executing a simple-command is to perform substitutions on the words of the command. There are three kinds of substitution: parameter, command and arithmetic. Parameter substitutions, which are described in detail in the next section, take the form  <b>$name</b> or <b>${</b>...<b>}</b>; command substitutions take the form  <b>$(</b><i>command</i><b>)</b> or <b>`</b><i>command</i><b>`</b>; and arithmetic substitutions take the form  <b>$((</b><i>expression</i><b>))</b>.<p>
If a substitution appears outside of double quotes, the results of the substitution are generally subject to word or field splitting according to the current value of the  <b>IFS</b> parameter. The  <b>IFS</b> parameter specifies a list of characters which are used to break a string up into several words; any characters from the set space, tab and newline that appear in the IFS characters are called  <i>IFS white space</i>. Sequences of one or more IFS white space characters, in combination with zero or one non-IFS white space characters delimit a field. As a special case, leading and trailing IFS white space is stripped ( <i>i.e.</i>, no leading or trailing empty field is created by it); leading or trailing non-IFS white space does create an empty field. Example: if  <b>IFS</b> is set to `&lt;space&gt;:', the sequence of characters `&lt;space&gt;A&lt;space&gt;:&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;B::D' contains four fields: `A', `B', `' and `D'. Note that if the  <b>IFS</b> parameter is set to the null string, no field splitting is done; if the parameter is unset, the default value of space, tab and newline is used.<p>
The results of substitution are, unless otherwise specified, also subject to brace expansion and file name expansion (see the relevant sections below).<p>
A command substitution is replaced by the output generated by the specified command, which is run in a subshell. For  <b>$(</b><i>command</i><b>)</b> substitutions, normal quoting rules are used when  <i>command</i> is parsed, however, for the  <b>`</b><i>command</i><b>`</b> form, a <b>&#92;</b> followed by any of  <b>$</b>, <b>`</b> or <b>&#92;</b> is stripped (a <b>&#92;</b> followed by any other character is unchanged). As a special case in command substitutions, a command of the form  <b>&lt;</b> <i>file</i> is interpreted to mean substitute the contents of  <i>file</i> ($(&lt; foo) has the same effect as $(cat foo), but it is carried out more efficiently because no process is started).<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
NOTE: <b>$(</b><i>command</i><b>)</b> expressions are currently parsed by finding the matching parenthesis, regardless of quoting. This will hopefully be fixed soon.<p>
Arithmetic substitutions are replaced by the value of the specified expression. For example, the command  <b>echo $((2+3*4))</b> prints 14. See Arithmetic Expressions for a description of an  <i>expression</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Parameters</h2> Parameters are shell variables; they can be assigned values and their values can be accessed using a parameter substitution. A parameter name is either one of the special single punctuation or digit character parameters described below, or a letter followed by zero or more letters or digits (`_' counts as a letter). The later form can be treated as arrays by appending an array index of the form:  <b>[</b><i>expr</i><b>]</b> where <i>expr</i> is an arithmetic expression. Array indices are currently limited to the range 0 through 1023, inclusive. Parameter substitutions take the form  <b>$</b><i>name</i>,  <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>}</b> or  <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[</b><i>expr</i><b>]}</b>, where <i>name</i> is a parameter name. If substitution is performed on a parameter (or an array parameter element) that is not set, a null string is substituted unless the  <b>nounset</b> option (<b>set &#45;o nounset</b> or  <b>set &#45;u</b>) is set, in which case an error occurs.<p>
Parameters can be assigned values in a number of ways. First, the shell implicitly sets some parameters like  <b>#</b>, <b>PWD</b>, etc.; this is the only way the special single character parameters are set. Second, parameters are imported from the shell's environment at startup. Third, parameters can be assigned values on the command line, for example, ` <b>FOO=bar</b>' sets the parameter FOO to bar; multiple parameter assignments can be given on a single command line and they can be followed by a simple-command, in which case the assignments are in effect only for the duration of the command (such assignments are also exported, see below for implications of this). Note that both the parameter name and the  <b>=</b> must be unquoted for the shell to recognize a parameter assignment. The fourth way of setting a parameter is with the  <b>export</b>, <b>readonly</b> and  <b>typeset</b> commands; see their descriptions in the Command Execution section. Fifth,  <b>for</b> and <b>select</b> loops set parameters as well as the  <b>getopts</b>, <b>read</b> and <b>set &#45;A</b> commands. Lastly, parameters can be assigned values using assignment operators inside arithmetic expressions (see Arithmetic Expressions below) or using the  <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i><b>}</b> form of parameter substitution (see below).<p>
Parameters with the export attribute (set using the <b>export</b> or  <b>typeset &#45;x</b> commands, or by parameter assignments followed by simple commands) are put in the environment (see  <i>environ</i>(7)) of commands run by the shell as  <i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> pairs. The order in which parameters appear in the environment of a command is unspecified. When the shell starts up, it extracts parameters and their values from its environment and automatically sets the export attribute for those parameters.<p>
Modifiers can be applied to the <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>}</b> form of parameter substitution:<dl>
<dt>
<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>:-</b><i>word</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
if <i>name</i> is set and not null, it is substituted, otherwise <i>word</i> is substituted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>:+</b><i>word</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
if <i>name</i> is set and not null, <i>word</i> is substituted, otherwise nothing is substituted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>:=</b><i>word</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
if <i>name</i> is set and not null, it is substituted, otherwise it is assigned  <i>word</i> and the resulting value of <i>name</i> is substituted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>:?</b><i>word</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
if <i>name</i> is set and not null, it is substituted, otherwise <i>word</i> is printed on standard error (preceded by  <i>name</i>:) and an error occurs (normally causing termination of a shell script, function or .-script). If word is omitted the string `parameter null or not set' is used instead.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
In the above modifiers, the <b>:</b> can be omitted, in which case the conditions only depend on  <i>name</i> being set (as opposed to set and not null). If  <i>word</i> is needed, parameter, command, arithmetic and tilde substitution are performed on it; if  <i>word</i> is not needed, it is not evaluated.<p>
The following forms of parameter substitution can also be used:<dl>
<dt>
<b>${#</b><i>name</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
The number of positional parameters if <i>name</i> is <b>*</b>, <b>@</b> or is not specified, or the length of the string value of parameter  <i>name</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${#</b><i>name</i><b>[*]}</b>, <b>${#</b><i>name</i><b>[@]}</b></dt>
<dd>
The number of elements in the array <i>name</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>#</b><i>pattern</i><b>}</b>, <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>##</b><i>pattern</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
If <i>pattern</i> matches the beginning of the value of parameter <i>name</i>, the matched text is deleted from the result of substitution. A single  <b>#</b> results in the shortest match, two <b>#</b>'s results in the longest match.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>%</b><i>pattern</i><b>}</b>, <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>%%</b><i>pattern</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
Like <b>${</b>..<b>#</b>..<b>}</b> substitution, but it deletes from the end of the value.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The following special parameters are implicitly set by the shell and cannot be set directly using assignments:<dl>
<dt>
<b>!</b></dt>
<dd>
Process id of the last background process started. If no background processes have been started, the parameter is not set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>0</b></dt>
<dd>
The name the shell was invoked with (<i>i.e.</i>, <b>argv[0]</b>), or the  <b>command-name</b> if it was invoked with the <b>&#45;c</b> option and the  <b>command-name</b> was supplied, or the <i>file</i> argument, if it was supplied. If the  <b>posix</b> option is not set, <b>$0</b> is the name of the current function or script.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>1</b> ... <b>9</b></dt>
<dd>
The first nine positional parameters that were supplied to the shell, function or  <b>.</b>-script. Further positional parameters may be accessed using  <b>${</b><i>number</i><b>}</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>*</b></dt>
<dd>
All positional parameters (except parameter 0),  <i>i.e.</i>, <b>$1 $2 $3</b>.... If used outside of double quotes, parameters are separate words (which are subjected to word splitting); if used within double quotes, parameters are separated by the first character of the  <b>IFS</b> parameter (or the empty string if  <b>IFS</b> is null).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>@</b></dt>
<dd>
Same as <b>$*</b>, unless it is used inside double quotes, in which case a separate word is generated for each positional parameter &#45; if there are no positional parameters, no word is generated ("$@" can be used to access arguments, verbatim, without losing null arguments or splitting arguments with spaces).</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The following parameters are set and/or used by the shell:<dl>
<dt>
<b>_</b> <i>(underscore)</i></dt>
<dd>
When an external command is executed by the shell, this parameter is set in the environment of the new process to the path of the executed command. In interactive use, this parameter is also set in the parent shell to the last word of the previous command. When  <b>MAILPATH</b> messages are evaluated, this parameter contains the name of the file that changed (see  <b>MAILPATH</b> parameter below).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>CDPATH</b></dt>
<dd>
Search path for the <b>cd</b> built-in command. Works the same way as  <b>PATH</b> for those directories not beginning with <b>/</b> in <b>cd</b> commands. Note that if CDPATH is set and does not contain  <b>.</b> nor an empty path, the current directory is not searched.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>COLUMNS</b></dt>
<dd>
Set to the number of columns on the terminal or window. Currently set to the  <b>cols</b> value as reported by <i>stty</i>(1) if that value is non-zero. This parameter is used by the interactive line editing modes, and by  <b>select</b>, <b>set &#45;o</b> and <b>kill &#45;l</b> commands to format information in columns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EDITOR</b></dt>
<dd>
If the <b>VISUAL</b> parameter is not set, this parameter controls the command line editing mode for interactive shells. See  <b>VISUAL</b> parameter below for how this works.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>ENV</b></dt>
<dd>
If this parameter is found to be set after any profile files are executed, the expanded value is used as a shell start-up file. It typically contains function and alias definitions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>ERRNO</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer value of the shell's errno variable &#8212; indicates the reason the last system call failed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Not implemented yet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EXECSHELL</b></dt>
<dd>
If set, this parameter is assumed to contain the shell that is to be used to execute commands that  <i>execve</i>(2) fails to execute and which do not start with a ` <b>#!</b> <i>shell</i>' sequence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>FCEDIT</b></dt>
<dd>
The editor used by the <b>fc</b> command (see below).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>FPATH</b></dt>
<dd>
Like <b>PATH</b>, but used when an undefined function is executed to locate the file defining the function. It is also searched when a command can't be found using  <b>PATH</b>. See Functions below for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>HISTFILE</b></dt>
<dd>
The name of the file used to store history. When assigned to, history is loaded from the specified file. Also, several invocations of the shell running on the same machine will share history if their  <b>HISTFILE</b> parameters all point at the same file.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
NOTE: if HISTFILE isn't set, no history file is used. This is different from the original Korn shell, which uses  <b>$HOME/.sh_history</b>; in future, pdksh may also use a default history file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>HISTSIZE</b></dt>
<dd>
The number of commands normally stored for history, default 128.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>IFS</b></dt>
<dd>
Internal field separator, used during substitution and by the <b>read</b> command, to split values into distinct arguments; normally set to space, tab and newline. See Substitution above for details.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Note:</b> this parameter is not imported from the environment when the shell is started.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>KSH_VERSION</b></dt>
<dd>
The version of shell and the date the version was created (readonly). See also the version commands in Emacs Editing Mode and Vi Editing Mode sections, below.</dd>

The line number of the function or shell script that is currently being executed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>LINES</b></dt>
<dd>

&#160;</div>
Not implemented yet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAIL</b></dt>
<dd>
If set, the user will be informed of the arrival of mail in the named file. This parameter is ignored if the  <b>MAILPATH</b> parameter is set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAILCHECK</b></dt>
<dd>
How often, in seconds, the shell will check for mail in the file(s) specified by  <b>MAIL</b> or <b>MAILPATH</b>. If 0, the shell checks before each prompt. The default is 600 (10 minutes).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAILPATH</b></dt>
<dd>
A list of files to be checked for mail. The list is colon separated, and each file may be followed by a  <b>?</b> and a message to be printed if new mail has arrived. Command, parameter and arithmetic substitution is performed on the message, and, during substitution, the parameter  <b>$_</b> contains the name of the file. The default message is  <b>you have mail in $_</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>OLDPWD</b></dt>
<dd>
The previous working directory. Unset if  <b>cd</b> has not successfully changed directories since the shell started, or if the shell doesn't know where it is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>OPTARG</b></dt>
<dd>
When using <b>getopts</b>, it contains the argument for a parsed option, if it requires one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>OPTIND</b></dt>
<dd>
The index of the last argument processed when using <b>getopts</b>. Assigning 1 to this parameter causes  <b>getopts</b> to process arguments from the beginning the next time it is invoked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PATH</b></dt>
<dd>
A colon separated list of directories that are searched when looking for commands and  <b>.</b>'d files. An empty string resulting from a leading or trailing colon, or two adjacent colons is treated as a `.', the current directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b></dt>
<dd>
If set, this parameter causes the <b>posix</b> option to be enabled. See POSIX Mode below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PPID</b></dt>
<dd>
The process ID of the shell's parent (readonly).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PS1</b></dt>
<dd>
<b>PS1</b> is the primary prompt for interactive shells. Parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions are performed, and  <b>!</b> is replaced with the current command number (see <b>fc</b> command below). A literal ! can be put in the prompt by placing !! in PS1. Note that since the command line editors try to figure out how long the prompt is (so they know how far it is to edge of the screen), escape codes in the prompt tend to mess things up. You can tell the shell not to count certain sequences (such as escape codes) by prefixing your prompt with a non-printing character (such as control-A) followed by a carriage return and then delimiting the escape codes with this non-printing character. If you don't have any non-printing characters, you're out of luck... BTW, don't blame me for this hack; it's in the original ksh. Default is ` <b>$&#160;</b>' for non-root users, `<b>#&#160;</b>' for root.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PS2</b></dt>
<dd>
Secondary prompt string, by default `<b>&gt;</b> ', used when more input is needed to complete a command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PS3</b></dt>
<dd>
Prompt used by <b>select</b> statement when reading a menu selection. Default is ` <b>#?&#160;</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PS4</b></dt>
<dd>
Used to prefix commands that are printed during execution tracing (see  <b>set &#45;x</b> command below). Parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions are performed before it is printed. Default is ` <b>+&#160;</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PWD</b></dt>
<dd>
The current working directory. Maybe unset or null if shell doesn't know where it is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>RANDOM</b></dt>
<dd>
A simple random number generator. Every time  <b>RANDOM</b> is referenced, it is assigned the next number in a random number series. The point in the series can be set by assigning a number to  <b>RANDOM</b> (see <i>rand</i>(3)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>REPLY</b></dt>
<dd>
Default parameter for the <b>read</b> command if no names are given. Also used in  <b>select</b> loops to store the value that is read from standard input.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>SECONDS</b></dt>
<dd>
The number of seconds since the shell started or, if the parameter has been assigned an integer value, the number of seconds since the assignment plus the value that was assigned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>TMOUT</b></dt>
<dd>
If set to a positive integer in an interactive shell, it specifies the maximum number of seconds the shell will wait for input after printing the primary prompt ( <b>PS1</b>). If the time is exceeded, the shell exits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>TMPDIR</b></dt>
<dd>
The directory shell temporary files are created in. If this parameter is not set, or does not contain the absolute path of a writable directory, temporary files are created in  <b>/tmp</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>VISUAL</b></dt>
<dd>
If set, this parameter controls the command line editing mode for interactive shells. If the last component of the path specified in this parameter contains the string  <b>vi</b>, <b>emacs</b> or <b>gmacs</b>, the vi, emacs or gmacs (Gosling emacs) editing mode is enabled, respectively.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Tilde Expansion</h2> Tilde expansion, which is done in parallel with parameter substitution, is done on words starting with an unquoted  <b>~</b>. The characters following the tilde, up to the first  <b>/</b>, if any, are assumed to be a login name. If the login name is empty,  <b>+</b> or <b>&#45;</b>, the value of the  <b>HOME</b>, <b>PWD</b>, or <b>OLDPWD</b> parameter is substituted, respectively. Otherwise, the password file is searched for the login name, and the tilde expression is substituted with the user's home directory. If the login name is not found in the password file or if any quoting or parameter substitution occurs in the login name, no substitution is performed.<p>
In parameter assignments (those preceding a simple-command or those occurring in the arguments of  <b>alias</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>readonly</b>, and  <b>typeset</b>), tilde expansion is done after any unquoted colon ( <b>:</b>), and login names are also delimited by colons.<p>
The home directory of previously expanded login names are cached and re-used. The  <b>alias &#45;d</b> command may be used to list, change and add to this cache ( <i>e.g.</i>, `alias &#45;d fac=/usr/local/facilities; cd ~fac/bin').</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Brace Expansion (alternation)</h2> Brace expressions, which take the form<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<i>prefix</i><b>{</b><i>str</i>1<b>,</b>...<b>,</b><i>str</i>N<b>}</b><i>suffix</i></div>
are expanded to N words, each of which is the concatenation of  <i>prefix</i>, <i>str</i>i and <i>suffix</i> ( <i>e.g.</i>, `a{c,b{X,Y},d}e' expands to four word: ace, abXe, abYe, and ade). As noted in the example, brace expressions can be nested and the resulting words are not sorted. Brace expressions must contain an unquoted comma ( <b>,</b>) for expansion to occur ( <i>i.e.</i>, <b>{}</b> and <b>{foo}</b> are not expanded). Brace expansion is carried out after parameter substitution and before file name generation.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>File Name Patterns</h2> A file name pattern is a word containing one or more unquoted  <b>?</b> or  <b>*</b> characters or <b>[</b>..<b>]</b> sequences. Once brace expansion has been performed, the shell replaces file name patterns with the sorted names of all the files that match the pattern (if no files match, the word is left unchanged). The pattern elements have the following meaning:<dl>
<dt>
<b>?</b></dt>
<dd>
matches any single character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>*</b></dt>
<dd>
matches any sequence of characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>[</b>..<b>]</b></dt>
<dd>
matches any of the characters inside the brackets. Ranges of characters can be specified by separating two characters by a  <b>&#45;</b>, <i>e.g.</i>,  <b>[a0&#45;9]</b> matches the letter <b>a</b> or any digit. In order to represent itself, a  <b>&#45;</b> must either be quoted or the first or last character in the character list. Similarly, a  <b>]</b> must be quoted or the first character in the list if it is represent itself instead of the end of the list. Also, a  <b>!</b> appearing at the start of the list has special meaning (see below), so to represent itself it must be quoted or appear later in the list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>[!</b>..<b>]</b></dt>
<dd>
like <b>[</b>..<b>]</b>, except it matches any character not inside the brackets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>*(</b><i>pattern</i><b>|</b> ... <b>|</b><i>pattern</i><b>)</b></dt>
<dd>
matches any string of characters that matches zero or more occurrences of the specified patterns. Example: the pattern  <b>*(foo|bar)</b> matches the strings `', `foo', `bar', `foobarfoo',  <i>etc.</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>+(</b><i>pattern</i><b>|</b> ... <b>|</b><i>pattern</i><b>)</b></dt>
<dd>
matches any string of characters that matches one or more occurrences of the specified patterns. Example: the pattern  <b>+(foo|bar)</b> matches the strings `foo', `bar', `foobarfoo',  <i>etc.</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>?(</b><i>pattern</i><b>|</b> ... <b>|</b><i>pattern</i><b>)</b></dt>
<dd>
matches the empty string or a string that matches one of the specified patterns. Example: the pattern  <b>?(foo|bar)</b> only matches the strings `', `foo' and `bar'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>@(</b><i>pattern</i><b>|</b> ... <b>|</b><i>pattern</i><b>)</b></dt>
<dd>
matches a string that matches one of the specified patterns. Example: the pattern  <b>@(foo|bar)</b> only matches the strings `foo' and `bar'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>!(</b><i>pattern</i><b>|</b> ... <b>|</b><i>pattern</i><b>)</b></dt>
<dd>
matches any string that does not match one of the specified patterns. Examples: the pattern  <b>!(foo|bar)</b> matches all strings except `foo' and `bar'; the pattern  <b>!(*)</b> matches no strings; the pattern  <b>!(?)*</b> matches all strings (think about it).</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Note that pdksh currently never matches <b>.</b> and <b>..</b>, but the original ksh, Bourne sh and bash do, so this may have to change (too bad).<p>
Note that none of the above pattern elements match either a period (<b>.</b>) at the start of a file name or a slash ( <b>/</b>), even if they are explicitly used in a  <b>[</b>..<b>]</b> sequence; also, the names <b>.</b> and <b>..</b> are never matched, even by the pattern  <b>.*</b>.<p>
If the <b>markdirs</b> option is set, any directories that result from file name generation are marked with a trailing  <b>/</b>.<p>
The POSIX character classes (<i>i.e.</i>,  <b>[:</b><i>class-name</i><b>:]</b> inside a <b>[</b>..<b>]</b> expression) are not yet implemented.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Input/Output Redirection</h2> When a command is executed, its standard input, standard output and standard error (file descriptors 0, 1 and 2, respectively) are normally inherited from the shell. Three exceptions to this are commands in pipelines, for which standard input and/or standard output are those set up by the pipeline, asynchronous commands created when job control is disabled, for which standard input is initially set to be from  <b>/dev/null</b>, and commands for which any of the following redirections have been specified:<dl>
<dt>
<b>&gt;</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
standard output is redirected to <i>file</i>. If  <i>file</i> does not exist, it is created; if it does exist, is a regular file and the  <b>noclobber</b> option is set, an error occurs, otherwise the file is truncated. Note that this means the command  <i>cmd &lt; foo &gt; foo</i> will open  <i>foo</i> for reading and then truncate it when it opens it for writing, before  <i>cmd</i> gets a chance to actually read <i>foo</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&gt;|</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
same as <b>&gt;</b>, except the file is truncated, even if the <b>noclobber</b> option is set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&gt;&gt;</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
same as <b>&gt;</b>, except the file an existing file is appended to instead of being truncated. Also, the file is opened in append mode, so writes always go to the end of the file (see  <i>open</i>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&lt;</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
standard input is redirected from <i>file</i>, which is opened for reading.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&lt;&gt;</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
same as <b>&lt;</b>, except the file is opened for reading and writing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&lt;&lt;</b> <i>marker</i></dt>
<dd>
after reading the command line containing this kind of redirection (called a here document), the shell copies lines from the command source into a temporary file until a line matching  <i>marker</i> is read. When the command is executed, standard input is redirected from the temporary file. If  <i>marker</i> contains no quoted characters, the contents of the temporary file are processed as if enclosed in double quotes each time the command is executed, so parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions are performed, along with backslash ( <b>&#92;</b>) escapes for  <b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, <b>&#92;</b> and <b>&#92;newline</b>. If multiple here documents are used on the same command line, they are saved in order.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&lt;&lt;-</b> <i>marker</i></dt>
<dd>
same as <b>&lt;&lt;</b>, except leading tabs are stripped from lines in the here document.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&lt;&amp;</b> <i>fd</i></dt>
<dd>
standard input is duplicated from file descriptor <i>fd</i>.  <i>fd</i> can be a single digit, indicating the number of an existing file descriptor, the letter  <b>p</b>, indicating the file descriptor associated with the output of the current co-process, or the character  <b>&#45;</b>, indicating standard input is to be closed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&gt;&amp;</b> <i>fd</i></dt>
<dd>
same as <b>&lt;&amp;</b>, except the operation is done on standard output.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
In any of the above redirections, the file descriptor that is redirected ( <i>i.e.</i>, standard input or standard output) can be explicitly given by preceding the redirection with a single digit. Parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions, tilde substitutions and (if the shell is interactive) file name generation are all performed on the  <i>file</i>, <i>marker</i> and <i>fd</i> arguments of redirections. Note however, that the results of any file name generation are only used if a single file is matched; if multiple files match, the word with the unexpanded file name generation characters is used. Note that in restricted shells, redirections which can create files cannot be used.<p>
For simple-commands, redirections may appear anywhere in the command, for compound-commands ( <b>if</b> statements, <i>etc.</i>), any redirections must appear at the end. Redirections are processed after pipelines are created and in the order they are given, so<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<b>cat /foo/bar 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; /dev/null | cat &#45;n</b></div>
will print an error with a line number prepended to it.</div>

<h2>Arithmetic Expressions</h2> Integer arithmetic expressions can be used with the  <b>let</b> command, inside  <b>$((</b>..<b>))</b> expressions, inside array references ( <i>e.g.</i>, <i>name</i><b>[</b><i>expr</i><b>]</b>), as numeric arguments to the  <b>test</b> command, and as the value of an assignment to an integer parameter.<p>

<h2>Co-Processes</h2> A co-process, which is a pipeline created with the  <b>|&amp;</b> operator, is an asynchronous process that the shell can both write to (using  <b>print &#45;p</b>) and read from (using <b>read &#45;p</b>). The input and output of the co-process can also be manipulated using  <b>&gt;&amp;p</b> and <b>&lt;&amp;p</b> redirections, respectively. Once a co-process has been started, another can't be started until the co-process exits, or until the co-process input has been redirected using an  <b>exec </b><i>n</i><b>&gt;&amp;p</b> redirection. If a co-process's input is redirected in this way, the next co-process to be started will share the output with the first co-process, unless the output of the initial co-process has been redirected using an  <b>exec </b><i>n</i><b>&lt;&amp;p</b> redirection.<p>
Some notes concerning co-processes:<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
the only way to close the co-process input (so the co-process reads an end-of-file) is to redirect the input to a numbered file descriptor and then close that file descriptor ( <i>e.g.</i>, <b>exec 3&gt;&amp;p;exec 3&gt;&amp;-</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
in order for co-processes to share a common output, the shell must keep the write portion of the output pipe open. This means that end of file will not be detected until all co-processes sharing the co-process output have exited (when they all exit, the shell closes its copy of the pipe). This can be avoided by redirecting the output to a numbered file descriptor (as this also causes the shell to close its copy). Note that this behaviour is slightly different from the original Korn shell which closes its copy of the write portion of the co-processes' output when the most recently started co-process (instead of when all sharing co-processes) exits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<b>print &#45;p</b> will ignore SIGPIPE signals during writes if the signal is not being trapped or ignored; the same is not true if the co-process input has been duplicated to another file descriptor and  <b>print &#45;u</b><i>n</i> is used.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Functions</h2> Functions are defined using either Korn shell  <b>function</b> <i>name</i> syntax or the Bourne/POSIX shell  <i>name</i><b>()</b> syntax (see below for the difference between the two forms). Functions are like  <b>.</b>-scripts in that they are executed in the current environment, however, unlike  <b>.</b>-scripts, shell arguments ( <i>i.e.</i>, positional parameters, <b>$1</b>, <i>etc.</i>) are never visible inside them. When the shell is determining the location of a command, functions are searched after special built-in commands, and before regular and non-regular built-ins, and before the  <b>PATH</b> is searched.<p>
An existing function may be deleted using <b>unset &#45;f</b> <i>function-name</i>. A list of functions can be obtained using  <b>typeset +f</b> and the function definitions can be listed using  <b>typeset &#45;f</b>.  <b>autoload</b> (which is an alias for <b>typeset &#45;fu</b>) may be used to create undefined functions; when an undefined function is executed, the shell searches the path specified in the  <b>FPATH</b> parameter for a file with the same name as the function, which, if found is read and executed. If after executing the file, the named function is found to be defined, the function is executed, otherwise, the normal command search is continued ( <i>i.e.</i>, the shell searches the regular built-in command table and  <b>PATH</b>). Note that if a command is not found using  <b>PATH</b>, an attempt is made to autoload a function using  <b>FPATH</b> (this is an undocumented feature of the original Korn shell).<p>
Functions can have two attributes, trace and export, which can be set with  <b>typeset &#45;ft</b> and <b>typeset &#45;fx</b>, respectively. When a traced function is executed, the shell's  <b>xtrace</b> option is turned on for the functions duration, otherwise the  <b>xtrace</b> option is turned off. The export attribute of functions is currently not used. In the original Korn shell, exported functions are visible to shell scripts that are executed.<p>
Since functions are executed in the current shell environment, parameter assignments made inside functions are visible after the function completes. If this is not the desired effect, the  <b>typeset</b> command can be used inside a function to create a local parameter. Note that special parameters ( <i>e.g.</i>, <b>$$</b>, <b>$!</b>) can't be scoped in this way.<p>
The exit status of a function is that of the last command executed in the function. A function can be made to finish immediately using the  <b>return</b> command; this may also be used to explicitly specify the exit status.<p>
Functions defined with the <b>function</b> reserved word are treated differently in the following ways from functions defined with the  <b>()</b> notation:<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
the <b>$0</b> parameter is set to the name of the function (Bourne-style functions leave  <b>$0</b> untouched).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
parameter assignments preceding function calls are not kept in the shell environment (executing Bourne-style functions will keep assignments).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<b>OPTIND</b> is saved/reset and restored on entry and exit from the function so  <b>getopts</b> can be used properly both inside and outside the function (Bourne-style functions leave  <b>OPTIND</b> untouched, so using <b>getopts</b> inside a function interferes with using  <b>getopts</b> outside the function). In the future, the following differences will also be added:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A separate trap/signal environment will be used during the execution of functions. This will mean that traps set inside a function will not affect the shell's traps and signals that are not ignored in the shell (but may be trapped) will have their default effect in a function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The EXIT trap, if set in a function, will be executed after the function returns.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>POSIX Mode</h2> The shell is intended to be POSIX compliant, however, in some cases, POSIX behaviour is contrary either to the original Korn shell behaviour or to user convenience. How the shell behaves in these cases is determined by the state of the posix option ( <b>set &#45;o posix</b>) &#8212; if it is on, the POSIX behaviour is followed, otherwise it is not. The  <b>posix</b> option is set automatically when the shell starts up if the environment contains the  <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> parameter. (The shell can also be compiled so that it is in POSIX mode by default, however this is usually not desirable).<p>
The following is a list of things that are affected by the state of the  <b>posix</b> option:<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<b>kill &#45;l</b> output: in posix mode, signal names are listed one a single line; in non-posix mode, signal numbers, names and descriptions are printed in columns. In future, a new option ( <b>&#45;v</b> perhaps) will be added to distinguish the two behaviours.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<b>fg</b> exit status: in posix mode, the exit status is 0 if no errors occur; in non-posix mode, the exit status is that of the last foregrounded job.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<b>eval</b> exit status: if eval gets to see an empty command (<i>e.g.</i>,  <b>eval "`false`"</b>), its exit status in posix mode will be 0. In non-posix mode, it will be the exit status of the last command substitution that was done in the processing of the arguments to eval (or 0 if there were no command substitutions).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<b>getopts</b>: in posix mode, options must start with a <b>&#45;</b>; in non-posix mode, options can start with either  <b>&#45;</b> or <b>+</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
brace expansion (also known as alternation): in posix mode, brace expansion is disabled; in non-posix mode, brace expansion enabled. Note that  <b>set &#45;o posix</b> (or setting the <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> parameter) automatically turns the  <b>braceexpand</b> option off, however it can be explicitly turned on later.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<b>set &#45;</b>: in posix mode, this does not clear the <b>verbose</b> or  <b>xtrace</b> options; in non-posix mode, it does.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<b>set</b> exit status: in posix mode, the exit status of set is 0 if there are no errors; in non-posix mode, the exit status is that of any command substitutions performed in generating the set command. For example, ` <b>set &#45;&#45; `false`; echo $?</b>' prints 0 in posix mode, 1 in non-posix mode. This construct is used in most shell scripts that use the old  <i>getopt</i>(1) command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
argument expansion of <b>alias</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>readonly</b>, and  <b>typeset</b> commands: in posix mode, normal argument expansion done; in non-posix mode, field splitting, file globing, brace expansion and (normal) tilde expansion are turned off, and assignment tilde expansion is turned on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
signal specification: in posix mode, signals can be specified as digits only if signal numbers match POSIX values ( <i>i.e.</i>, HUP=1, INT=2, QUIT=3, ABRT=6, KILL=9, ALRM=14, and TERM=15); in non-posix mode, signals can be always digits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
alias expansion: in posix mode, alias expansion is only carried out when reading command words; in non-posix mode, alias expansion is carried out on any word following an alias that ended in a space. For example, the following for loop</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
alias a='for ' i='j'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
a i in 1 2; do echo i=$i j=$j; done</div>
uses parameter <b>i</b> in posix mode, <b>j</b> in non-posix mode.<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
test: in posix mode, the expression "<b>-t</b>" (preceded by some number of " <b>!</b>" arguments) is always true as it is a non-zero length string; in non-posix mode, it tests if file descriptor 1 is a tty ( <i>i.e.</i>, the  <i>fd</i> argument to the <b>-t</b> test may be left out and defaults to 1).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Command Execution</h2> After evaluation of command line arguments, redirections and parameter assignments, the type of command is determined: a special built-in, a function, a regular built-in or the name of a file to execute found using the  <b>PATH</b> parameter. The checks are made in the above order. Special built-in commands differ from other commands in that the  <b>PATH</b> parameter is not used to find them, an error during their execution can cause a non-interactive shell to exit and parameter assignments that are specified before the command are kept after the command completes. Just to confuse things, if the posix option is turned off (see  <b>set</b> command below) some special commands are very special in that no field splitting, file globing, brace expansion nor tilde expansion is performed on arguments that look like assignments. Regular built-in commands are different only in that the  <b>PATH</b> parameter is not used to find them.<p>
The original ksh and POSIX differ somewhat in which commands are considered special or regular:<dl>

In the future, the additional ksh special and regular commands may be treated differently from the POSIX special and regular commands.<p>
Once the type of the command has been determined, any command line parameter assignments are performed and exported for the duration of the command.<p>
The following describes the special and regular built-in commands:<dl>
<dt>
<b>.</b> <i>file</i> [<i>arg1</i> ...]</dt>
<dd>
Execute the commands in <i>file</i> in the current environment. The file is searched for in the directories of  <b>PATH</b>. If arguments are given, the positional parameters may be used to access them while  <i>file</i> is being executed. If no arguments are given, the positional parameters are those of the environment the command is used in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>:</b> [ ... ]</dt>
<dd>
The null command. Exit status is set to zero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>alias</b> [ <b>&#45;d</b> | <b>&#177;t</b> [<b>&#45;r</b>] ] [<b>&#177;px</b>] [<b>&#177;</b>] [<i>name1</i>[<b>=</b><i>value1</i>] ...]</dt>
<dd>
Without arguments, <b>alias</b> lists all aliases. For any name without a value, the existing alias is listed. Any name with a value defines an alias (see Aliases above).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When listing aliases, one of two formats is used: normally, aliases are listed as  <i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>, where  <i>value</i> is quoted; if options were preceded with <b>+</b> or a lone  <b>+</b> is given on the command line, only <i>name</i> is printed. In addition, if the  <b>&#45;p</b> option is used, each alias is prefixed with the string " <b>alias</b>&#160;".<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>&#45;x</b> option sets (<b>+x</b> clears) the export attribute of an alias, or, if no names are given, lists the aliases with the export attribute (exporting an alias has no affect).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>&#45;t</b> option indicates that tracked aliases are to be listed/set (values specified on the command line are ignored for tracked aliases). The  <b>&#45;r</b> option indicates that all tracked aliases are to be reset.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>&#45;d</b> causes directory aliases, which are used in tilde expansion, to be listed or set (see Tilde Expansion above).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>bg</b> [<i>job</i> ...]</dt>
<dd>
Resume the specified stopped job(s) in the background. If no jobs are specified,  <b>%+</b> is assumed. This command is only available on systems which support job control. See Job Control below for more information.</dd>

<dt>
<b>cd</b> [<b>&#45;LP</b>] [<i>dir</i>]</dt>
<dd>
Set the working directory to <i>dir</i>. If the parameter  <b>CDPATH</b> is set, it lists directories to search in for  <i>dir</i>. An empty entry in the  <b>CDPATH</b> entry means the current directory. If a non-empty directory from  <b>CDPATH</b> is used, the resulting full path is printed to standard output. If  <i>dir</i> is missing, the home directory  <b>$HOME</b> is used. If  <i>dir</i> is  <b>&#45;</b>, the previous working directory is used (see OLDPWD parameter). If  <b>&#45;L</b> option (logical path) is used or if the <b>physical</b> option (see  <b>set</b> command below) isn't set, references to <b>..</b> in <i>dir</i> are relative to the path used get to the directory. If  <b>&#45;P</b> option (physical path) is used or if the <b>physical</b> option is set,  <b>..</b> is relative to the filesystem directory tree. The  <b>PWD</b> and <b>OLDPWD</b> parameters are updated to reflect the current and old wording directory, respectively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>cd</b> [<b>&#45;LP</b>] <i>old new</i></dt>
<dd>
The string <i>new</i> is substituted for <i>old</i> in the current directory, and the shell attempts to change to the new directory.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>command</b> [<b>&#45;pvV</b>] <i>cmd</i> [<i>arg1</i> ...]</dt>
<dd>
If neither the <b>&#45;v</b> nor <b>&#45;V</b> options are given,  <i>cmd</i> is executed exactly as if the  <b>command</b> had not been specified, with two exceptions: first,  <i>cmd</i> cannot be a shell function, and second, special built-in commands lose their specialness ( <i>i.e.</i>, redirection and utility errors do not cause the shell to exit, and command assignments are not permanent). If the  <b>&#45;p</b> option is given, a default search path is used instead of the current value of  <b>PATH</b> (the actual value of the default path is system dependent: on POSIXish systems, it is the value returned by  <b>getconf CS_PATH</b> ).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the <b>&#45;v</b> option is given, instead of executing <i>cmd</i>, information about what would be executed is given (and the same is done for  <i>arg1</i> ...): for special and regular built-in commands and functions, their names are simply printed, for aliases, a command that defines them is printed, and for commands found by searching the  <b>PATH</b> parameter, the full path of the command is printed. If no command is found, ( <i>i.e.</i>, the path search fails), nothing is printed and  <b>command</b> exits with a non-zero status. The  <b>&#45;V</b> option is like the <b>&#45;v</b> option, except it is more verbose.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>continue</b> [<i>levels</i>]</dt>

<dt>
<b>echo</b> [<b>&#45;neE</b>] [<i>arg</i> ...]</dt>
<dd>
Prints its arguments (separated by spaces) followed by a newline, to standard out. The newline is suppressed if any of the arguments contain the backslash sequence  <b>&#92;c</b>. See  <b>print</b> command below for a list of other backslash sequences that are recognized.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The options are provided for compatibility with BSD shell scripts:  <b>&#45;n</b> suppresses the trailing newline, <b>&#45;e</b> enables backslash interpretation (a no-op, since this is normally done), and  <b>&#45;E</b> suppresses backslash interpretation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>eval</b> <i>command ...</i></dt>
<dd>
The arguments are concatenated (with spaces between them) to form a single string which the shell then parses and executes in the current environment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>exec</b> [<i>command</i> [<i>arg</i> ...]]</dt>
<dd>
The command is executed without forking, replacing the shell process.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If no arguments are given, any IO redirection is permanent and the shell is not replaced. Any file descriptors greater than 2 which are opened or  <i>dup</i>(2)-ed in this way are not made available to other executed commands ( <i>i.e.</i>, commands that are not built-in to the shell). Note that the Bourne shell differs here: it does pass these file descriptors on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>exit</b> [<i>status</i>]</dt>
<dd>
The shell exits with the specified exit status. If  <i>status</i> is not specified, the exit status is the current value of the  <b>?</b> parameter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>export</b> [<b>&#45;p</b>] [<i>parameter</i>[<b>=</b><i>value</i>]] ...</dt>
<dd>
Sets the export attribute of the named parameters. Exported parameters are passed in the environment to executed commands. If values are specified, the named parameters also assigned.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If no parameters are specified, the names of all parameters with the export attribute are printed one per line, unless the  <b>&#45;p</b> option is used, in which case  <b>export</b> commands defining all exported parameters, including their values, are printed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>false</b></dt>

<b>fc</b> [<b>&#45;e</b> <i>editor</i> | <b>&#45;l</b> [<b>&#45;n</b>]] [<b>&#45;r</b>] [<i>first</i> [<i>last</i>]]</dt>
<dd>
<i>first</i> and <i>last</i> select commands from the history. Commands can be selected by history number, or a string specifying the most recent command starting with that string. The  <b>&#45;l</b> option lists the command on stdout, and  <b>&#45;n</b> inhibits the default command numbers. The  <b>&#45;r</b> option reverses the order of the list. Without  <b>&#45;l</b>, the selected commands are edited by the editor specified with the  <b>&#45;e</b> option, or if no  <b>&#45;e</b> is specified, the editor specified by the  <b>FCEDIT</b> parameter (if this parameter is not set, <b>/bin/ed</b> is used), and then executed by the shell.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>fc</b> [<b>&#45;e &#45;</b> | <b>&#45;s</b>] [<b>&#45;g</b>] [<i>old</i><b>=</b><i>new</i>] [<i>prefix</i>]</dt>
<dd>
Re-execute the selected command (the previous command by default) after performing the optional substitution of  <i>old</i> with <i>new</i>. If  <b>&#45;g</b> is specified, all occurrences of <i>old</i> are replaced with  <i>new</i>. This command is usually accessed with the predefined alias  <b>r='fc &#45;e &#45;'</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>fg</b> [<i>job</i> ...]</dt>
<dd>
Resume the specified job(s) in the foreground. If no jobs are specified,  <b>%+</b> is assumed. This command is only available on systems which support job control. See Job Control below for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>getopts</b> <i>optstring</i> <i>name</i> [<i>arg</i> ...]</dt>
<dd>
<b>getopts</b> is used by shell procedures to parse the specified arguments (or positional parameters, if no arguments are given) and to check for legal options.  <i>optstring</i> contains the option letters that  <b>getopts</b> is to recognize. If a letter is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an argument. Options that do not take arguments may be grouped in a single argument. If an option takes an argument and the option character is not the last character of the argument it is found in, the remainder of the argument is taken to be the option's argument, otherwise, the next argument is the option's argument.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Each time <b>getopts</b> is invoked, it places the next option in the shell parameter  <i>name</i> and the index of the next argument to be processed in the shell parameter  <b>OPTIND</b>. If the option was introduced with a  <b>+</b>, the option placed in  <i>name</i> is prefixed with a <b>+</b>. When an option requires an argument,  <b>getopts</b> places it in the shell parameter  <b>OPTARG</b>. When an illegal option or a missing option argument is encountered a question mark or a colon is placed in  <i>name</i> (indicating an illegal option or missing argument, respectively) and  <b>OPTARG</b> is set to the option character that caused the problem. An error message is also printed to standard error if  <i>optstring</i> does not begin with a colon.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When the end of the options is encountered, <b>getopts</b> exits with a non-zero exit status. Options end at the first (non-option) argument that does not start with a &#45;, or when a  <b>&#45;&#45;</b> argument is encountered.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Option parsing can be reset by setting <b>OPTIND</b> to 1 (this is done automatically whenever the shell or a shell procedure is invoked).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Warning: Changing the value of the shell parameter <b>OPTIND</b> to a value other than 1, or parsing different sets of arguments without resetting  <b>OPTIND</b> may lead to unexpected results.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>hash</b> [<b>&#45;r</b>] [<i>name ...</i>]</dt>
<dd>
Without arguments, any hashed executable command pathnames are listed. The  <b>&#45;r</b> option causes all hashed commands to be removed from the hash table. Each  <i>name</i> is searched as if it where a command name and added to the hash table if it is an executable command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>jobs</b> [<b>&#45;lpn</b>] [<i>job</i> ...]</dt>
<dd>
Display information about the specified jobs; if no jobs are specified, all jobs are displayed. The  <b>&#45;n</b> option causes information to be displayed only for jobs that have changed state since the last notification. If the  <b>&#45;l</b> option is used, the process-id of each process in a job is also listed. The  <b>&#45;p</b> option causes only the process group of each job to be printed. See Job Control below for the format of  <i>job</i> and the displayed job.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>kill</b> [<b>&#45;s</b> <i>signame</i> | <b>&#45;signum</b> | <b>&#45;signame</b> ] { <i>job</i> | <i>pid</i> | <b>&#45;</b><i>pgrp</i> } ...</dt>
<dd>
Send the specified signal to the specified jobs, process ids, or process groups. If no signal is specified, the signal TERM is sent. If a job is specified, the signal is sent to the job's process group. See Job Control below for the format of  <i>job</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>kill &#45;l</b> [<i>exit-status</i> ...]</dt>
<dd>
Print the name of the signal that killed a process which exited with the specified  <i>exit-status</i>es. If no arguments are specified, a list of all the signals, their numbers and a short description of them are printed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>let</b> [<i>expression</i> ...]</dt>
<dd>
Each expression is evaluated, see Arithmetic Expressions above. If all expressions are successfully evaluated, the exit status is 0 (1) if the last expression evaluated to non-zero (zero). If an error occurs during the parsing or evaluation of an expression, the exit status is greater than 1. Since expressions may need to be quoted,  <b>((</b> <i>expr</i> <b>))</b> is syntactic sugar for <b>let</b>  <b>"</b><i>expr</i><b>"</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>print</b> [<b>&#45;nprsu</b><i>n</i> | <b>&#45;R</b> [<b>&#45;en</b>]] [<i>argument ...</i>]</dt>
<dd>
<b>Print</b> prints its arguments on the standard output, separated by spaces, and terminated with a newline. The  <b>&#45;n</b> option suppresses the newline. By default, certain C escapes are translated. These include &#92;b, &#92;f, &#92;n, &#92;r, &#92;t, &#92;v, and &#92;0### (# is an octal digit, of which there may be 0 to 3). &#92;c is equivalent to using the  <b>&#45;n</b> option. &#92; expansion may be inhibited with the  <b>&#45;r</b> option. The  <b>&#45;s</b> option prints to the history file instead of standard output, the  <b>&#45;u</b> option prints to file descriptor <i>n</i> (<i>n</i> defaults to 1 if omitted), and the  <b>&#45;p</b> option prints to the co-process (see Co-Processes above).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>&#45;R</b> option is used to emulate, to some degree, the BSD echo command, which does not process &#92; sequences unless the  <b>&#45;e</b> option is given. As above, the  <b>&#45;n</b> option suppresses the trailing newline.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>pwd</b> [<b>&#45;LP</b>]</dt>
<dd>
Print the present working directory. If  <b>&#45;L</b> option is used or if the <b>physical</b> option (see  <b>set</b> command below) isn't set, the logical path is printed ( <i>i.e.</i>, the path used to <b>cd</b> to the current directory). If  <b>&#45;P</b> option (physical path) is used or if the <b>physical</b> option is set, the path determined from the filesystem (by following  <b>..</b> directories to the root directory) is printed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>read</b> [<b>&#45;prsu</b><i>n</i>] [<i>parameter ...</i>]</dt>
<dd>
Reads a line of input from standard input, separate the line into fields using the  <b>IFS</b> parameter (see Substitution above), and assign each field to the specified parameters. If there are more parameters than fields, the extra parameters are set to null, or alternatively, if there are more fields than parameters, the last parameter is assigned the remaining fields (inclusive of any separating spaces). If no parameters are specified, the  <b>REPLY</b> parameter is used. If the input line ends in a backslash and the  <b>&#45;r</b> option was not used, the backslash and newline are stripped and more input is read. If no input is read,  <b>read</b> exits with a non-zero status.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The first parameter may have a question mark and a string appended to it, in which case the string is used as a prompt (printed to standard error before any input is read) if the input is a tty ( <i>e.g.</i>, <b>read nfoo?'number of foos: '</b>).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>&#45;u</b><i>n</i> and <b>&#45;p</b> options cause input to be read from file descriptor  <i>n</i> or the current co-process (see Co-Processes above for comments on this), respectively. If the  <b>&#45;s</b> option is used, input is saved to the history file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>readonly</b> [<b>&#45;p</b>] [<i>parameter</i>[<b>=</b><i>value</i>]] ...</dt>
<dd>
Sets the readonly attribute of the named parameters. If values are given, parameters are set to them before setting the attribute. Once a parameter is made readonly, it cannot be unset and its value cannot be changed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If no parameters are specified, the names of all parameters with the readonly attribute are printed one per line, unless the  <b>&#45;p</b> option is used, in which case  <b>readonly</b> commands defining all readonly parameters, including their values, are printed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>return</b> [<i>status</i>]</dt>
<dd>
Returns from a function or <b>.</b> script, with exit status <i>status</i>. If no  <i>status</i> is given, the exit status of the last executed command is used. If used outside of a function or  <b>.</b> script, it has the same effect as  <b>exit</b>. Note that pdksh treats both profile and  <b>$ENV</b> files as <b>.</b> scripts, while the original Korn shell only treats profiles as  <b>.</b> scripts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>set</b> [<b>&#177;abCefhkmnpsuvxX</b>] [<b>&#177;o</b> [<i>option</i>]] [<b>&#177;A</b> <i>name</i>] [<b>&#45;&#45;</b>] [<i>arg</i> ...]</dt>
<dd>
The set command can be used to set (<b>&#45;</b>) or clear (<b>+</b>) shell options, set the positional parameters, or set an array parameter. Options can be changed using the  <b>&#177;o</b> <i>option</i> syntax, where  <i>option</i> is the long name of an option, or using the  <b>&#177;</b><i>letter</i> syntax, where <i>letter</i> is the option's single letter name (not all options have a single letter name). The following table lists both option letters (if they exist) and long names along with a description of what the option does.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

On operating systems not supporting <b>/dev/fd/</b><i>n</i> devices (where  <i>n</i> is a file descriptor number), the  <b>test</b> command will attempt to fake it for all tests that operate on files (except the  <b>-e</b> test). I.e.,  <b>[ -w /dev/fd/2 ]</b> tests if file descriptor 2 is writable.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that some special rules are applied (courtesy of POSIX) if the number of arguments to  <b>test</b> or <b>[</b> ... <b>]</b> is less than five: if leading  <b>!</b> arguments can be stripped such that only one argument remains then a string length test is performed (again, even if the argument is a unary operator); if leading  <b>!</b> arguments can be stripped such that three arguments remain and the second argument is a binary operator, then the binary operation is performed (even if first argument is a unary operator, including an unstripped  <b>!</b>).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Note:</b> A common mistake is to use <b>if [ $foo = bar ]</b> which fails if parameter  <b>foo</b> is null or unset, if it has embedded spaces ( <i>i.e.</i>, <b>IFS</b> characters), or if it is a unary operator like <b>!</b> or  <b>&#45;n</b>. Use tests like  <b>if [ "X$foo" = Xbar ]</b> instead.</dd>

<b>time</b> [<b>-p</b>] [ <i>pipeline</i> ]</dt>
<dd>
If a pipeline is given, the times used to execute the pipeline are reported. If no pipeline is given, then the user and system time used by the shell itself, and all the commands it has run since it was started, are reported. The times reported are the real time (elapsed time from start to finish), the user CPU time (time spent running in user mode) and the system CPU time (time spent running in kernel mode). Times are reported to standard error; the format of the output is:<br>
    0.00s real     0.00s user     0.00s system<br>
unless the -p option is given (only possible if <i>pipeline</i> is a simple command), in which case the output is slightly longer:<br>
    real   0.00<br>
    user   0.00<br>
    sys    0.00<br>
(the number of digits after the decimal may vary from system to system). Note that simple redirections of standard error do not effect the output of the time command:  <b>time sleep 1 2&gt; </b><i>afile</i>  <b>{ time sleep 1; } 2&gt; </b><i>afile</i> times for the first command do not go to  <i>afile</i>, but those of the second command do.</dd>

<b>trap</b> [<i>handler</i> <i>signal ...</i>]</dt>

Sets trap handler that is to be executed when any of the specified signals are received.  <b>Handler</b> is either a null string, indicating the signals are to be ignored, a minus ( <b>&#45;</b>), indicating that the default action is to be taken for the signals (see signal(3)), or a string containing shell commands to be evaluated and executed at the first opportunity ( <i>i.e.</i>, when the current command completes, or before printing the next  <b>PS1</b> prompt) after receipt of one of the signals.  <b>Signal</b> is the name of a signal (<i>e.g.</i>, PIPE or ALRM) or the number of the signal (see  <b>kill &#45;l</b> command above). There are two special signals:  <b>EXIT</b> (also known as <b>0</b>), which is executed when the shell is about to exit, and  <b>ERR</b> which is executed after an error occurs (an error is something that would cause the shell to exit if the  <b>&#45;e</b> or <b>errexit</b> option were set &#8212; see  <b>set</b> command above).  <b>EXIT</b> handlers are executed in the environment of the last executed command. Note that for non-interactive shells, the trap handler cannot be changed for signals that were ignored when the shell started.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With no arguments, <b>trap</b> lists, as a series of <b>trap</b> commands, the current state of the traps that have been set since the shell started. Note that the output of  <b>trap</b> can not be usefully piped to another process (an artifact of the fact that traps are cleared when subprocesses are created).<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Display or set parameter attributes.

&#160;</div>
If <i>name</i> arguments are given, the attributes of the named parameters are set ( <b>&#45;</b>) or cleared (<b>+</b>). Values for parameters may optionally be specified. If typeset is used inside a function, any newly created parameters are local to the function.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When <b>&#45;f</b> is used, typeset operates on the attributes of functions.

<h2>Job Control</h2> Job control refers to the shell's ability to monitor and control  <b>jobs</b>, which are processes or groups of processes created for commands or pipelines. At a minimum, the shell keeps track of the status of the background ( <i>i.e.</i>, asynchronous) jobs that currently exist; this information can be displayed using the  <b>jobs</b> command. If job control is fully enabled (using  <b>set &#45;m</b> or  <b>set &#45;o monitor</b>), as it is for interactive shells, the processes of a job are placed in their own process group, foreground jobs can be stopped by typing the suspend character from the terminal (normally ^Z), jobs can be restarted in either the foreground or background, using the  <b>fg</b> and <b>bg</b> commands, respectively, and the state of the terminal is saved or restored when a foreground job is stopped or restarted, respectively.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that only commands that create processes (<i>e.g.</i>, asynchronous commands, subshell commands, and non-built-in, non-function commands) can be stopped; commands like  <b>read</b> cannot be.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When a job is created, it is assigned a job-number. For interactive shells, this number is printed inside  <b>[</b>..<b>]</b>, followed by the process-ids of the processes in the job when an asynchronous command is run. A job may be referred to in  <b>bg</b>, <b>fg</b>, <b>jobs</b>, <b>kill</b> and  <b>wait</b> commands either by the process id of the last process in the command pipeline (as stored in the  <b>$!</b> parameter) or by prefixing the job-number with a percent sign ( <b>%</b>). Other percent sequences can also be used to refer to jobs:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<p>
When an attempt is made to exit the shell while there are jobs in the stopped state, the shell warns the user that there are stopped jobs and does not exit. If another attempt is immediately made to exit the shell, the stopped jobs are sent a  <b>HUP</b> signal and the shell exits. Similarly, if the  <b>nohup</b> option is not set and there are running jobs when an attempt is made to exit a login shell, the shell warns the user and does not exit. If another attempt is immediately made to exit the shell, the running jobs are sent a  <b>HUP</b> signal and the shell exits.</div>

<h2>Interactive Input Line Editing</h2> The shell supports three modes of reading command lines from a tty in an interactive session. Which is used is controlled by the  <b>emacs</b>, <b>gmacs</b> and <b>vi</b>  <b>set</b> options (at most one of these can be set at once). If none of these options is enabled, the shell simply reads lines using the normal tty driver. If the  <b>emacs</b> or <b>gmacs</b> option is set, the shell allows emacs like editing of the command; similarly, if the  <b>vi</b> option is set, the shell allows vi like editing of the command. These modes are described in detail in the following sections.<p>
In these editing modes, if a line is longer that the screen width (see  <b>COLUMNS</b> parameter), a  <b>&gt;</b>, <b>+</b> or <b>&lt;</b> character is displayed in the last column indicating that there are more characters after, before and after, or before the current position, respectively. The line is scrolled horizontally as necessary.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Emacs Editing Mode</h2> When the  <b>emacs</b> option is set, interactive input line editing is enabled.  <b>Warning</b>: This mode is slightly different from the emacs mode in the original Korn shell and the 8th bit is stripped in emacs mode. In this mode various editing commands (typically bound to one or more control characters) cause immediate actions without waiting for a new-line. Several editing commands are bound to particular control characters when the shell is invoked; these bindings can be changed using the following commands:<dl>
<dt>
<b>bind</b></dt>
<dd>
The current bindings are listed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>bind</b> <i>string</i><b>=</b>[<i>editing-command</i>]</dt>
<dd>
The specified editing command is bound to the given <b>string</b>, which should consist of a control character (which may be written using caret notation  <b>^</b><i>X</i>), optionally preceded by one of the two prefix characters. Future input of the  <i>string</i> will cause the editing command to be immediately invoked. Note that although only two prefix characters (usually ESC and ^X) are supported, some multi-character sequences can be supported. The following binds the arrow keys on an ANSI terminal, or xterm (these are in the default bindings). Of course some escape sequences won't work out quite this nicely:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dd>
The specified input <i>string</i> will afterwards be immediately replaced by the given  <i>substitute</i> string, which may contain editing commands.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The following is a list of editing commands available. Each description starts with the name of the command, a  <i>n</i>, if the command can be prefixed with a count, and any keys the command is bound to by default (written using caret notation,  <i>e.g.</i>, ASCII ESC character is written as ^[). A count prefix for a command is entered using the sequence  <b>^[</b><i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is a sequence of 1 or more digits; unless otherwise specified, if a count is omitted, it defaults to 1. Note that editing command names are used only with the  <b>bind</b> command. Furthermore, many editing commands are useful only on terminals with a visible cursor. The default bindings were chosen to resemble corresponding EMACS key bindings. The users tty characters ( <i>e.g.</i>, ERASE) are bound to reasonable substitutes and override the default bindings.<dl>

<h2>Vi Editing Mode</h2> The vi command line editor in ksh has basically the same commands as the vi editor (see  <i>vi</i>(1)), with the following exceptions:<dl>
<dt>

<dd>
you start out in insert mode,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
there are file name and command completion commands ( <b>=</b>, <b>&#92;</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>^X</b>, <b>^E</b>, <b>^F</b> and, optionally,  <b>&lt;tab&gt;</b>),</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
the <b>_</b> command is different (in ksh it is the last argument command, in vi it goes to the start of the current line),</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
the <b>/</b> and <b>G</b> commands move in the opposite direction as the <b>j</b> command</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#160;&#160;&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
and commands which don't make sense in a single line editor are not available ( <i>e.g.</i>, screen movement commands, ex <b>:</b> commands, <i>etc.</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Note that the <b>^X</b> stands for control-X; also <b>&lt;esc&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;space&gt;</b> and  <b>&lt;tab&gt;</b> are used for escape, space and tab, respectively (no kidding).<p>
Like vi, there are two modes: insert mode and command mode. In insert mode, most characters are simply put in the buffer at the current cursor position as they are typed, however, some characters are treated specially. In particular, the following characters are taken from current tty settings (see  <i>stty</i>(1)) and have their usual meaning (normal values are in parentheses): kill ( <b>^U</b>), erase (<b>^?</b>), werase (<b>^W</b>), eof (<b>^D</b>), intr ( <b>^C</b>) and quit (<b>^&#92;</b>). In addition to the above, the following characters are also treated specially in insert mode:<table class="tbl">
<col style="width: 5.00ex;">

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

<p>
In command mode, each character is interpreted as a command. Characters that don't correspond to commands, are illegal combinations of commands or are commands that can't be carried out all cause beeps. In the following command descriptions, a  <i>n</i> indicates the command may be prefixed by a number ( <i>e.g.</i>, <b>10l</b> moves right 10 characters); if no number prefix is used,  <i>n</i> is assumed to be 1 unless otherwise specified. The term `current position' refers to the position between the cursor and the character preceding the cursor. A `word' is a sequence of letters, digits and underscore characters or a sequence of non-letter, non-digit, non-underscore, non-white-space characters ( <i>e.g.</i>, ab2*&amp;^ contains two words) and a `big-word' is a sequence of non-white-space characters.<dl>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
<i>n</i><b>_</b></dt>
<dd>
insert a space followed by the <i>n</i>th big-word from the last command in the history at the current position and enter insert mode; if  <i>n</i> is not specified, the last word is inserted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>#</b></dt>
<dd>
insert the comment character (<b>#</b>) at the start of the current line and return the line to the shell (equivalent to  <b>I#^J</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>n</i><b>g</b></dt>
<dd>
like <b>G</b>, except if <i>n</i> is not specified, it goes to the most recent remembered line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>n</i><b>v</b></dt>
<dd>
edit line <i>n</i> using the vi editor; if  <i>n</i> is not specified, the current line is edited. The actual command executed is ` <b>fc &#45;e ${VISUAL:-${EDITOR:-vi}}</b> <i>n</i>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>*</b> and <b>^X</b></dt>
<dd>
command or file name expansion is applied to the current big-word (with an appended *, if the word contains no file globing characters) - the big-word is replaced with the resulting words. If the current big-word is the first on the line (or follows one of the following characters:  <b>;</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>(</b>, <b>)</b>) and does not contain a slash ( <b>/</b>) then command expansion is done, otherwise file name expansion is done. Command expansion will match the big-word against all aliases, functions and built-in commands as well as any executable files found by searching the directories in the  <b>PATH</b> parameter. File name expansion matches the big-word against the files in the current directory. After expansion, the cursor is placed just past the last word and the editor is in insert mode.</dd>

<h1>BUGS</h1> Any bugs in pdksh should be reported to pdksh@cs.mun.ca. Please include the version of pdksh (echo $KSH_VERSION shows it), the machine, operating system and compiler you are using and a description of how to repeat the bug (a small shell script that demonstrates the bug is best). The following, if relevant (if you are not sure, include them), can also helpful: options you are using (both options.h options and set &#45;o options) and a copy of your config.h (the file generated by the configure script). New versions of pdksh can be obtained from ftp://ftp.cs.mun.ca/pub/pdksh/.<p>
BTW, the most frequently reported bug is<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<b> echo hi | read a; echo $a</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;# Does not print hi</div>
I'm aware of this and there is no need to report it.</div>
