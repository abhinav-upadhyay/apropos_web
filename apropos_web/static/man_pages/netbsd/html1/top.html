<h1>NAME</h1> top &#45; display and update information about the top cpu processes</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>top</b> [ <b>&#45;1CISTabcinqtuv</b> ] [ <b>&#45;d</b><i>count</i> ] [ <b>&#45;m</b><i>mode</i> ] [ <b>&#45;o</b><i>field</i> ] [ <b>&#45;p</b><i>pid</i> ] [ <b>&#45;s</b><i>time</i> ] [ <b>&#45;U</b><i>username</i> ] [ <i>number</i> ]</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <i>Top</i> displays the top processes on the system and periodically updates this information. If standard output is an intelligent terminal (see below) then as many processes as will fit on the terminal screen are displayed by default.  Otherwise, a good number of them are shown (around 20). Raw cpu percentage is used to rank the processes.  If <i>number</i> is given, then the top <i>number</i> processes will be displayed instead of the default.<p>
<i>Top</i> makes a distinction between terminals that support advanced capabilities and those that do not.  This distinction affects the choice of defaults for certain options.  In the remainder of this document, an "intelligent" terminal is one that supports cursor addressing, clear screen, and clear to end of line. Conversely, a "dumb" terminal is one that does not support such features.  If the output of <i>top</i> is redirected to a file, it acts as if it were being run on a dumb terminal.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;1, &#45;&#45;percpustates</b></dt>
<dd>
Display per-cpu states on a multi-processor machine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;C, &#45;&#45;color</b></dt>
<dd>
Turn off the use of color in the display.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;I, &#45;&#45;idle-procs</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not display idle processes. By default, top displays both active and idle processes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;S, &#45;&#45;system-procs</b></dt>
<dd>
Show system processes in the display.  Normally, system processes such as the pager and the swapper are not shown.  This option makes them visible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;T, &#45;&#45;tag-names</b></dt>
<dd>
List all available color tags and the current set of tests used for color highlighting, then exit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;a, &#45;&#45;all</b></dt>
<dd>
Show all processes for as long as possible.  This is shorthand for "-d all all".  This option is especially handy in batch mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;b, &#45;n, &#45;&#45;batch</b></dt>
<dd>
Use "batch" mode.  In this mode, all input from the terminal is ignored.  Interrupt characters (such as ^C and ^&#92;) still have an effect. This is the default on a dumb terminal, or when the output is not a terminal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;c, &#45;&#45;full-commands</b></dt>
<dd>
Show the full command line for each process. Default is to show just the command name.  This option is not supported on all platforms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;i, &#45;&#45;interactive</b></dt>
<dd>
Use "interactive" mode.  In this mode, any input is immediately read for processing.  See the section on "Interactive Mode" for an explanation of which keys perform what functions.  After the command is processed, the screen will immediately be updated, even if the command was not understood.  This mode is the default when standard output is an intelligent terminal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;q, &#45;&#45;quick</b></dt>
<dd>
Renice <i>top</i> to -20 so that it will run faster.  This can be used when the system is being very sluggish to improve the possibility of discovering the problem. This option can only be used by root.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;t, &#45;&#45;threads</b></dt>
<dd>
Show individual threads on separate lines.  By default, on systems which support threading, each process is shown with a count of the number of threads. This option shows each thread on a separate line.  This option is not supported on all platforms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;u, &#45;&#45;uids</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not take the time to map uid numbers to usernames.  Normally, <i>top</i> will read as much of the file "/etc/passwd" as is necessary to map all the user id numbers it encounters into login names.  This option disables all that, while possibly decreasing execution time.  The uid numbers are displayed instead of the names.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;v, &#45;&#45;version</b></dt>
<dd>
Write version number information to stderr then exit immediately. No other processing takes place when this option is used.  To see current revision information while top is running, use the help command "?".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;d <i>count</i>, &#45;&#45;displays <i>count</i></b></dt>
<dd>
Show only <i>count</i> displays, then exit.  A display is considered to be one update of the screen.  This option allows the user to select the number of displays he wants to see before <i>top</i> automatically exits.  Any proper prefix of the words "infinity", "maximum", or "all" can be used to indicate an infinite number of displays. The default for intelligent terminals is infinity. The default for dumb terminals is 1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;m <i>mode</i>, &#45;&#45;mode=<i>mode</i></b></dt>
<dd>
Start the display in an alternate mode.  Some platforms support multiple process displays to show additional process information.  The value  <i>mode</i> is a number indicating which mode to display.  The default is 0.  On platforms that do not have multiple display modes this option has no effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;o <i>field</i>, &#45;&#45;sort-order=<i>field</i></b></dt>
<dd>
Sort the process display area on the specified field.  The field name is the name of the column as seen in the output, but in lower case.  Likely values are "cpu", "size", "res", and "time", but may vary on different operating systems.  Note that not all operating systems support this option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;p <i>pid</i>, &#45;&#45;pid=<i>pid</i></b></dt>
<dd>
Only display the specified pid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;s <i>time</i>, &#45;&#45;delay=<i>time</i></b></dt>
<dd>
Set the delay between screen updates to <i>time</i> seconds.  The default delay between updates is seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;U <i>username</i>, &#45;&#45;user=<i>username</i></b></dt>
<dd>
Show only those processes owned by <i>username</i>. This option currently only accepts usernames and will not understand uid numbers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Both <i>count</i> and <i>number</i> fields can be specified as "infinite", indicating that they can stretch as far as possible.  This is accomplished by using any proper prefix of the keywords "infinity", "maximum", or "all". The default for <i>count</i> on an intelligent terminal is, in fact,  <b>infinity</b>.<p>
The environment variable <b>TOP</b> is examined for options before the command line is scanned.  This enables a user to set his or her own defaults.  The number of processes to display can also be specified in the environment variable <b>TOP</b>. The options <b>&#45;C</b>, <b>&#45;I</b>, <b>&#45;S</b>, and <b>&#45;u</b> are actually toggles.  A second specification of any of these options will negate the first.  Thus a user who has the environment variable <b>TOP</b> set to "&#45;I" may use the command "top &#45;I" to see idle processes.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>INTERACTIVE MODE</h1> When <i>top</i> is running in "interactive mode", it reads commands from the terminal and acts upon them accordingly.  In this mode, the terminal is put in "CBREAK", so that a character will be processed as soon as it is typed.  Almost always, a key will be pressed when <i>top</i> is between displays; that is, while it is waiting for <i>time</i> seconds to elapse.  If this is the case, the command will be processed and the display will be updated immediately thereafter (reflecting any changes that the command may have specified).  This happens even if the command was incorrect.  If a key is pressed while <i>top</i> is in the middle of updating the display, it will finish the update and then process the command.  Some commands require additional information, and the user will be prompted accordingly.  While typing this information in, the user's erase and kill keys (as set up by the command <i>stty</i>) are recognized, and a newline terminates the input.  Note that a control-L (^L) always redraws the current screen and a space forces an immediate update to the screen using new data.<p>
These commands are currently recognized:<dl>
<dt>

<h1>THE DISPLAY</h1> The actual display varies depending on the specific variant of Unix that the machine is running.  This description may not exactly match what is seen by top running on this particular machine.  Differences are listed at the end of this manual entry.<p>
The top lines of the display show general information about the state of the system.  The first line shows (on some systems) the last process id assigned to a process, the three load averages, the system uptime, and the current time. The second line displays the total number of processes followed by a breakdown of processes per state.  Examples of states common to Unix systems are sleeping, running, starting, stopped, and zombie. The next line displays a percentage of time spent in each of the processor states (typically user, nice, system, idle, and iowait). These percentages show the processor activity during the time since the last update.  For multi-processor systems, this information is a summation of time across all processors.  The next line shows kernel-related activity (not available on all systems).  The numbers shown on this line are per-second rates sampled since the last update. The exact information displayed varies between systems, but some examples are: context switches, interrupts, traps, forks, and page faults.  The last one or two lines show a summary of memory and swap activity.  These lines vary between systems.<p>
The remainder of the screen displays information about individual processes.  This display is similar in spirit to <i>ps</i>(1) but it is not exactly the same.  The columns displayed by top will differ slightly between operating systems.  Generally, the following fields are displayed:<dl>
<dt>
<b>PID</b></dt>
<dd>
The process id.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>USERNAME</b></dt>
<dd>
Username of the process's owner (if <b>&#45;u</b> is specified, a UID column will be substituted for USERNAME).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>THR</b></dt>
<dd>
The number of threads in the processes (this column may also be labeled NLWP).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PRI</b></dt>
<dd>
Current priority of the process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>NICE</b></dt>
<dd>
Nice amount in the range &#45;20 to 20, as established by the use of the command <i>nice</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>SIZE</b></dt>
<dd>
Total size of the process (text, data, and stack) given in kilobytes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>RES</b></dt>
<dd>
Resident memory: current amount of process memory that resides in physical memory, given in kilobytes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>STATE</b></dt>
<dd>
Current state (typically one of "sleep", "run", "idl", "zomb", or "stop").</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>TIME</b></dt>
<dd>
Number of system and user cpu seconds that the process has used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>CPU</b></dt>
<dd>
Percentage of available cpu time used by this process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>COMMAND</b></dt>
<dd>
Name of the command that the process is currently running.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>COLOR</h1> Top supports the use of ANSI color in its output. By default, color is available but not used.  The environment variable <b>TOPCOLORS</b> specifies colors to use and conditions for which they should be used. At the present time, only numbers in the summay display area can be colored. In a future version it will be possible to highlight numbers in the process display area as well.  The environment variable is the only way to specify color: there is no equivalent command line option. Note that the environment variable <b>TOPCOLOURS</b> is also understood. The British spelling takes precedence.  The use of color only works on terminals that understand and process ANSI color escape sequences.<p>
The environment variable is a sequence of color specifications, separated by colons. Each specification takes the form tag=min,max#code where <i>tag</i> is the name of the value to check, <i>min</i> and <i>max</i> specify a range for the value, and <i>code</i> is an ANSI color code.  Multiple color codes can be listed and separated with semi-colons.  A missing <i>min</i> implies the lowest possible value (usually 0) and a missing <i>max</i> implies infinity. The comma must always be present. When specifying numbers for load averages, they should be multiplied by 100. For example, the specification <b>1min=500,1000#31</b> indicates that a 1 minute load average between 5 and 10 should be displayed in red. Color attributes can be combined. For example, the specification <b>5min=1000,#37;41</b> indicates that a 5 minute load average higher than 10 should be displayed with white characters on a red background. A special tag named <i>header</i> is used to control the color of the header for process display.  It should be specified with no lower and upper limits, specifically <b>header=,#</b> followed by the ANSI color code.<p>
You can see a list of color codes recognized by this installation of top with the <b>&#45;T</b> option.  This will also show the current set of tests used for color highligting, as specified in the environment.</div>
