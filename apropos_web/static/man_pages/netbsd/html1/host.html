<h1>NAME</h1> host &#45; DNS lookup utility</div>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <b>host</b> is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is normally used to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no arguments or options are given,  <b>host</b> prints a short summary of its command line arguments and options.<p>
<i>name</i> is the domain name that is to be looked up. It can also be a dotted&#45;decimal IPv4 address or a colon&#45;delimited IPv6 address, in which case  <b>host</b> will by default perform a reverse lookup for that address.  <i>server</i> is an optional argument which is either the name or IP address of the name server that  <b>host</b> should query instead of the server or servers listed in  <i>/etc/resolv.conf</i>.<p>
The  <b>&#45;a</b> (all) option is equivalent to setting the  <b>&#45;v</b> option and asking  <b>host</b> to make a query of type ANY.<p>
When the  <b>&#45;C</b> option is used,  <b>host</b> will attempt to display the SOA records for zone  <i>name</i> from all the listed authoritative name servers for that zone. The list of name servers is defined by the NS records that are found for the zone.<p>
The  <b>&#45;c</b> option instructs to make a DNS query of class  <i>class</i>. This can be used to lookup Hesiod or Chaosnet class resource records. The default class is IN (Internet).<p>
Verbose output is generated by  <b>host</b> when the  <b>&#45;d</b> or  <b>&#45;v</b> option is used. The two options are equivalent. They have been provided for backwards compatibility. In previous versions, the  <b>&#45;d</b> option switched on debugging traces and  <b>&#45;v</b> enabled verbose output.<p>
List mode is selected by the  <b>&#45;l</b> option. This makes  <b>host</b> perform a zone transfer for zone  <i>name</i>. Transfer the zone printing out the NS, PTR and address records (A/AAAA). If combined with  <b>&#45;a</b> all records will be printed.<p>
The  <b>&#45;i</b> option specifies that reverse lookups of IPv6 addresses should use the IP6.INT domain as defined in RFC1886. The default is to use IP6.ARPA.<p>
The  <b>&#45;N</b> option sets the number of dots that have to be in  <i>name</i> for it to be considered absolute. The default value is that defined using the ndots statement in  <i>/etc/resolv.conf</i>, or 1 if no ndots statement is present. Names with fewer dots are interpreted as relative names and will be searched for in the domains listed in the  <b>search</b> or  <b>domain</b> directive in  <i>/etc/resolv.conf</i>.<p>
The number of UDP retries for a lookup can be changed with the  <b>&#45;R</b> option.  <i>number</i> indicates how many times  <b>host</b> will repeat a query that does not get answered. The default number of retries is 1. If  <i>number</i> is negative or zero, the number of retries will default to 1.<p>
Non&#45;recursive queries can be made via the  <b>&#45;r</b> option. Setting this option clears the  <b>RD</b> &#8212; recursion desired &#8212; bit in the query which  <b>host</b> makes. This should mean that the name server receiving the query will not attempt to resolve  <i>name</i>. The  <b>&#45;r</b> option enables  <b>host</b> to mimic the behavior of a name server by making non&#45;recursive queries and expecting to receive answers to those queries that are usually referrals to other name servers.<p>
By default,  <b>host</b> uses UDP when making queries. The  <b>&#45;T</b> option makes it use a TCP connection when querying the name server. TCP will be automatically selected for queries that require it, such as zone transfer (AXFR) requests.<p>
The  <b>&#45;4</b> option forces  <b>host</b> to only use IPv4 query transport. The  <b>&#45;6</b> option forces  <b>host</b> to only use IPv6 query transport.<p>
The  <b>&#45;t</b> option is used to select the query type.  <i>type</i> can be any recognized query type: CNAME, NS, SOA, SIG, KEY, AXFR, etc. When no query type is specified,  <b>host</b> automatically selects an appropriate query type. By default, it looks for A, AAAA, and MX records, but if the  <b>&#45;C</b> option was given, queries will be made for SOA records, and if  <i>name</i> is a dotted&#45;decimal IPv4 address or colon&#45;delimited IPv6 address,  <b>host</b> will query for PTR records. If a query type of IXFR is chosen the starting serial number can be specified by appending an equal followed by the starting serial number (e.g. &#45;t IXFR=12345678).<p>
The time to wait for a reply can be controlled through the  <b>&#45;W</b> and  <b>&#45;w</b> options. The  <b>&#45;W</b> option makes  <b>host</b> wait for  <i>wait</i> seconds. If  <i>wait</i> is less than one, the wait interval is set to one second. When the  <b>&#45;w</b> option is used,  <b>host</b> will effectively wait forever for a reply. The time to wait for a response will be set to the number of seconds given by the hardware's maximum value for an integer quantity.<p>
The  <b>&#45;s</b> option tells  <b>host</b>  <i>not</i> to send the query to the next nameserver if any server responds with a SERVFAIL response, which is the reverse of normal stub resolver behavior.<p>
The  <b>&#45;m</b> can be used to set the memory usage debugging flags  <i>record</i>,  <i>usage</i> and  <i>trace</i>.<p>
The  <b>&#45;V</b> option causes  <b>host</b> to print the version number and exit.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>IDN SUPPORT</h1> If  <b>host</b> has been built with IDN (internationalized domain name) support, it can accept and display non&#45;ASCII domain names.  <b>host</b> appropriately converts character encoding of domain name before sending a request to DNS server or displaying a reply from the server. If you'd like to turn off the IDN support for some reason, defines the  <b>IDN_DISABLE</b> environment variable. The IDN support is disabled if the variable is set when  <b>host</b> runs.</div>
