<h1>NAME</h1> grep, egrep, fgrep &#45; print lines matching a pattern</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>grep</b> [<i>options</i>] <i>PATTERN</i> [<i>FILE</i>...]<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>grep</b> [<i>options</i>] [<b>&#45;e</b> <i>PATTERN</i> | <b>&#45;f</b> <i>FILE</i>] [<i>FILE</i>...]</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <b>Grep</b> searches the named input <i>FILE</i>s (or standard input if no files are named, or the file name <b>&#45;</b> is given) for lines containing a match to the given <i>PATTERN</i>. By default, <b>grep</b> prints the matching lines.<p>
In addition, two variant programs <b>egrep</b> and <b>fgrep</b> are available. <b>Egrep</b> is the same as <b>grep&#160;&#45;E</b>. <b>Fgrep</b> is the same as <b>grep&#160;&#45;F</b>.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;A</b><i> NUM</i><b>, &#45;&#45;after-context=</b><i>NUM</i></dt>
<dd>
Print <i>NUM</i> lines of trailing context after matching lines. Places a line containing <b>&#45;&#45;</b> between contiguous groups of matches.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;a</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;text</b></dt>
<dd>
Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the <b>&#45;&#45;binary-files=text</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;B</b><i> NUM</i><b>, &#45;&#45;before-context=</b><i>NUM</i></dt>
<dd>
Print <i>NUM</i> lines of leading context before matching lines. Places a line containing <b>&#45;&#45;</b> between contiguous groups of matches.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;b</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;byte-offset</b></dt>
<dd>
Print the byte offset within the input file before each line of output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;binary-files=</b><i>TYPE</i></dt>
<dd>
If the first few bytes of a file indicate that the file contains binary data, assume that the file is of type <i>TYPE</i>. By default, <i>TYPE</i> is <b>binary</b>, and <b>grep</b> normally outputs either a one-line message saying that a binary file matches, or no message if there is no match. If <i>TYPE</i> is <b>without-match</b>, <b>grep</b> assumes that a binary file does not match; this is equivalent to the <b>&#45;I</b> option. If <i>TYPE</i> is <b>text</b>, <b>grep</b> processes a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the <b>&#45;a</b> option. <i>Warning:</i> <b>grep &#45;&#45;binary-files=text</b> might output binary garbage, which can have nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and if the terminal driver interprets some of it as commands.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;C</b><i> NUM</i><b>, &#45;&#45;context=</b><i>NUM</i></dt>
<dd>
Print <i>NUM</i> lines of output context. Places a line containing <b>&#45;&#45;</b> between contiguous groups of matches.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;c</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;count</b></dt>
<dd>
Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file. With the <b>&#45;v</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;invert-match</b> option (see below), count non-matching lines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;colour[=<i>WHEN</i>]</b><i>, </i><b>&#45;&#45;color[=<i>WHEN</i>]</b></dt>
<dd>
Surround the matching string with the marker find in <b>GREP_COLOR</b> environment variable. WHEN may be `never', `always', or `auto'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;D</b><i> ACTION</i><b>, &#45;&#45;devices=</b><i>ACTION</i></dt>
<dd>
If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use <i>ACTION</i> to process it.  By default, <i>ACTION</i> is <b>read</b>, which means that devices are read just as if they were ordinary files. If <i>ACTION</i> is <b>skip</b>, devices are silently skipped.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;d</b><i> ACTION</i><b>, &#45;&#45;directories=</b><i>ACTION</i></dt>
<dd>
If an input file is a directory, use <i>ACTION</i> to process it.  By default, <i>ACTION</i> is <b>read</b>, which means that directories are read just as if they were ordinary files. If <i>ACTION</i> is <b>skip</b>, directories are silently skipped. If <i>ACTION</i> is <b>recurse</b>, <b>grep</b> reads all files under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent to the <b>&#45;r</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;E</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;extended-regexp</b></dt>
<dd>
Interpret <i>PATTERN</i> as an extended regular expression (see below).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;e</b><i> PATTERN</i><b>, &#45;&#45;regexp=</b><i>PATTERN</i></dt>
<dd>
Use <i>PATTERN</i> as the pattern; useful to protect patterns beginning with <b>&#45;</b>. May be specified more than once.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;F</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;fixed-strings</b></dt>
<dd>
Interpret <i>PATTERN</i> as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines, any of which is to be matched.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;f</b><i> FILE</i><b>, &#45;&#45;file=</b><i>FILE</i></dt>
<dd>
Obtain patterns from <i>FILE</i>, one per line. The empty file contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;G</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;basic-regexp</b></dt>
<dd>
Interpret <i>PATTERN</i> as a basic regular expression (see below).  This is the default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;H</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;with-filename</b></dt>
<dd>
Print the filename for each match.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;h</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;no-filename</b></dt>
<dd>
Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when multiple files are searched.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;help</b></dt>
<dd>
Output a brief help message.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;I</b></dt>
<dd>
Process a binary file as if it did not contain matching data; this is equivalent to the <b>&#45;&#45;binary-files=without-match</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;i</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;ignore-case</b></dt>
<dd>
Ignore case distinctions in both the <i>PATTERN</i> and the input files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;L</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;files-without-match</b></dt>
<dd>
Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which no output would normally have been printed.  The scanning will stop on the first match.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;l</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;files-with-matches</b></dt>
<dd>
Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which output would normally have been printed.  The scanning will stop on the first match.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;label=</b><i>LABEL</i></dt>
<dd>
Displays input actually coming from standard input as input coming from file <i>LABEL.</i> This is especially useful for tools like zgrep, e.g. <b>gzip -cd foo.gz |grep --label=foo something</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;line-buffered</b></dt>
<dd>
Use line buffering, it can be a performance penalty.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;m</b><i> NUM</i><b>, &#45;&#45;max-count=</b><i>NUM</i></dt>
<dd>
Stop reading a file after <i>NUM</i> matching lines.  If the input is standard input from a regular file, and <i>NUM</i> matching lines are output, <b>grep</b> ensures that the standard input is positioned to just after the last matching line before exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing context lines.  This enables a calling process to resume a search. When <b>grep</b> stops after <i>NUM</i> matching lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.  When the <b>&#45;c</b> or <b>&#45;&#45;count</b> option is also used, <b>grep</b> does not output a count greater than <i>NUM</i>. When the <b>&#45;v</b> or <b>&#45;&#45;invert-match</b> option is also used, <b>grep</b> stops after outputting <i>NUM</i> non-matching lines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;&#45;mmap</b></dt>
<dd>
If possible, use the <b>mmap</b>(2) system call to read input, instead of the default <b>read</b>(2) system call.  In some situations, <b>&#45;&#45;mmap</b> yields better performance.  However, <b>&#45;&#45;mmap</b> can cause undefined behavior (including core dumps) if an input file shrinks while <b>grep</b> is operating, or if an I/O error occurs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;n</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;line-number</b></dt>
<dd>
Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;o</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;only-matching</b></dt>
<dd>
Show only the part of a matching line that matches <i>PATTERN.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;q</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;quiet</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;silent</b></dt>
<dd>
Quiet; do not write anything to standard output. Exit immediately with zero status if any match is found, even if an error was detected. Also see the <b>&#45;s</b> or <b>&#45;&#45;no-messages</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;R</b>, <b>&#45;r</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;recursive</b></dt>
<dd>
Read all files under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent to the <b>&#45;d recurse</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>  &#45;&#45;include=</b>PATTERN</dt>
<dd>
Recurse in directories only searching file matching <i>PATTERN.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>  &#45;&#45;exclude=</b>PATTERN</dt>
<dd>
Recurse in directories skip file matching <i>PATTERN.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;s</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;no-messages</b></dt>
<dd>
Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files. Portability note: unlike GNU <b>grep</b>, traditional <b>grep</b> did not conform to POSIX.2, because traditional <b>grep</b> lacked a <b>&#45;q</b> option and its <b>&#45;s</b> option behaved like GNU <b>grep</b>'s <b>&#45;q</b> option. Shell scripts intended to be portable to traditional <b>grep</b> should avoid both <b>&#45;q</b> and <b>&#45;s</b> and should redirect output to /dev/null instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;U</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;binary</b></dt>
<dd>
Treat the file(s) as binary.  By default, under MS-DOS and MS-Windows, <b>grep</b> guesses the file type by looking at the contents of the first 32KB read from the file.  If <b>grep</b> decides the file is a text file, it strips the CR characters from the original file contents (to make regular expressions with <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> work correctly).  Specifying <b>&#45;U</b> overrules this guesswork, causing all files to be read and passed to the matching mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF pairs at the end of each line, this will cause some regular expressions to fail. This option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;u</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;unix-byte-offsets</b></dt>
<dd>
Report Unix-style byte offsets.  This switch causes <b>grep</b> to report byte offsets as if the file were Unix-style text file, i.e. with CR characters stripped off.  This will produce results identical to running <b>grep</b> on a Unix machine.  This option has no effect unless <b>&#45;b</b> option is also used; it has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;V</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;version</b></dt>
<dd>
Print the version number of <b>grep</b> to standard error.  This version number should be included in all bug reports (see below).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;v</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;invert-match</b></dt>
<dd>
Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;w</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;word-regexp</b></dt>
<dd>
Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words. The test is that the matching substring must either be at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a non-word constituent character.  Similarly, it must be either at the end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent character.  Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;x</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;line-regexp</b></dt>
<dd>
Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;y</b></dt>
<dd>
Obsolete synonym for <b>&#45;i</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;Z</b>, <b>&#45;&#45;null</b></dt>
<dd>
Output a zero byte (the ASCII <b>NUL</b> character) instead of the character that normally follows a file name. For example, <b>grep &#45;lZ</b> outputs a zero byte after each file name instead of the usual newline. This option makes the output unambiguous, even in the presence of file names containing unusual characters like newlines.  This option can be used with commands like <b>find &#45;print0</b>, <b>perl &#45;0</b>, <b>sort &#45;z</b>, and <b>xargs &#45;0</b> to process arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters.</dd>

<h1>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS</h1> A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings. Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.<p>
<b>Grep</b> understands two different versions of regular expression syntax: &#8220;basic&#8221; and &#8220;extended.&#8221;  In GNU&#160;<b>grep</b>, there is no difference in available functionality using either syntax. In other implementations, basic regular expressions are less powerful. The following description applies to extended regular expressions; differences for basic regular expressions are summarized afterwards.<p>
The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a single character.  Most characters, including all letters and digits, are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any metacharacter with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.<p>
A <i>bracket expression</i> is a list of characters enclosed by <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. It matches any single character in that list; if the first character of the list is the caret <b>^</b> then it matches any character <i>not</i> in the list. For example, the regular expression <b>[0123456789]</b> matches any single digit.<p>
Within a bracket expression, a <i>range expression</i> consists of two characters separated by a hyphen. It matches any single character that sorts between the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's collating sequence and character set. For example, in the default C locale, <b>[a&#45;d]</b> is equivalent to <b>[abcd]</b>. Many locales sort characters in dictionary order, and in these locales <b>[a&#45;d]</b> is typically not equivalent to <b>[abcd]</b>; it might be equivalent to <b>[aBbCcDd]</b>, for example. To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by setting the <b>LC_ALL</b> environment variable to the value <b>C</b>.<p>
Finally, certain named classes of characters are predefined within bracket expressions, as follows. Their names are self explanatory, and they are <b>[:alnum:]</b>, <b>[:alpha:]</b>, <b>[:cntrl:]</b>, <b>[:digit:]</b>, <b>[:graph:]</b>, <b>[:lower:]</b>, <b>[:print:]</b>, <b>[:punct:]</b>, <b>[:space:]</b>, <b>[:upper:]</b>, and <b>[:xdigit:].</b> For example, <b>[[:alnum:]]</b> means <b>[0&#45;9A&#45;Za&#45;z]</b>, except the latter form depends upon the C locale and the ASCII character encoding, whereas the former is independent of locale and character set. (Note that the brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket list.)  Most metacharacters lose their special meaning inside lists.  To include a literal <b>]</b> place it first in the list.  Similarly, to include a literal <b>^</b> place it anywhere but first.  Finally, to include a literal <b>&#45;</b> place it last.<p>
The period <b>.</b> matches any single character. The symbol <b>&#92;w</b> is a synonym for <b>[[:alnum:]]</b> and <b>&#92;W</b> is a synonym for <b>[^[:alnum:]]</b>.<p>
The caret <b>^</b> and the dollar sign <b>$</b> are metacharacters that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line. The symbols <b>&#92;&lt;</b> and <b>&#92;&gt;</b> respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a word. The symbol <b>&#92;b</b> matches the empty string at the edge of a word, and <b>&#92;B</b> matches the empty string provided it's <i>not</i> at the edge of a word.<p>
A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:<dl>
<dt>
<b>?</b></dt>
<dd>
The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>*</b></dt>
<dd>
The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>+</b></dt>
<dd>
The preceding item will be matched one or more times.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>{</b><i>n</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
The preceding item is matched exactly <i>n</i> times.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>{</b><i>n</i><b>,}</b></dt>
<dd>
The preceding item is matched <i>n</i> or more times.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>{</b><i>n</i><b>,</b><i>m</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
The preceding item is matched at least <i>n</i> times, but not more than <i>m</i> times.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular expression matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings that respectively match the concatenated subexpressions.<p>
Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator <b>|</b>; the resulting regular expression matches any string matching either subexpression.<p>
Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes precedence over alternation.  A whole subexpression may be enclosed in parentheses to override these precedence rules.<p>
The backreference <b>&#92;</b><i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is a single digit, matches the substring previously matched by the <i>n</i>th parenthesized subexpression of the regular expression.<p>
In basic regular expressions the metacharacters <b>?</b>, <b>+</b>, <b>{</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>(</b>, and <b>)</b> lose their special meaning; instead use the backslashed versions <b>&#92;?</b>, <b>&#92;+</b>, <b>&#92;{</b>, <b>&#92;|</b>, <b>&#92;(</b>, and <b>&#92;)</b>.<p>
Traditional <b>egrep</b> did not support the <b>{</b> metacharacter, and some <b>egrep</b> implementations support <b>&#92;{</b> instead, so portable scripts should avoid <b>{</b> in <b>egrep</b> patterns and should use <b>[{]</b> to match a literal <b>{</b>.<p>
GNU <b>egrep</b> attempts to support traditional usage by assuming that <b>{</b> is not special if it would be the start of an invalid interval specification.  For example, the shell command <b>egrep '{1'</b> searches for the two-character string <b>{1</b> instead of reporting a syntax error in the regular expression. POSIX.2 allows this behavior as an extension, but portable scripts should avoid it.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h1> Grep's behavior is affected by the following environment variables.<p>
A locale <b>LC_</b><i>foo</i> is specified by examining the three environment variables <b>LC_ALL</b>, <b>LC_<i>foo</i></b>, <b>LANG</b>, in that order. The first of these variables that is set specifies the locale. For example, if <b>LC_ALL</b> is not set, but <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> is set to <b>pt_BR</b>, then Brazilian Portuguese is used for the <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> locale. The C locale is used if none of these environment variables are set, or if the locale catalog is not installed, or if <b>grep</b> was not compiled with national language support (NLS).<dl>
<dt>
<b>GREP_OPTIONS</b></dt>
<dd>
This variable specifies default options to be placed in front of any explicit options.  For example, if <b>GREP_OPTIONS</b> is <b>'&#45;&#45;binary-files=without-match &#45;&#45;directories=skip'</b>, <b>grep</b> behaves as if the two options <b>&#45;&#45;binary-files=without-match</b> and <b>&#45;&#45;directories=skip</b> had been specified before any explicit options. Option specifications are separated by whitespace. A backslash escapes the next character, so it can be used to specify an option containing whitespace or a backslash.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>GREP_COLOR</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the marker for highlighting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>LC_ALL</b>, <b>LC_COLLATE</b>, <b>LANG</b></dt>
<dd>
These variables specify the <b>LC_COLLATE</b> locale, which determines the collating sequence used to interpret range expressions like <b>[a&#45;z]</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>LC_ALL</b>, <b>LC_CTYPE</b>, <b>LANG</b></dt>
<dd>
These variables specify the <b>LC_CTYPE</b> locale, which determines the type of characters, e.g., which characters are whitespace.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>LC_ALL</b>, <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>, <b>LANG</b></dt>
<dd>
These variables specify the <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> locale, which determines the language that <b>grep</b> uses for messages. The default C locale uses American English messages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b></dt>
<dd>
If set, <b>grep</b> behaves as POSIX.2 requires; otherwise, <b>grep</b> behaves more like other GNU programs. POSIX.2 requires that options that follow file names must be treated as file names; by default, such options are permuted to the front of the operand list and are treated as options. Also, POSIX.2 requires that unrecognized options be diagnosed as &#8220;illegal&#8221;, but since they are not really against the law the default is to diagnose them as &#8220;invalid&#8221;. <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> also disables  <b>_</b><i>N</i><b>_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_</b>, described below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>_</b><i>N</i><b>_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_</b></dt>
<dd>
(Here <i>N</i> is <b>grep</b>'s numeric process ID.)  If the <i>i</i>th character of this environment variable's value is <b>1</b>, do not consider the <i>i</i>th operand of <b>grep</b> to be an option, even if it appears to be one. A shell can put this variable in the environment for each command it runs, specifying which operands are the results of file name wildcard expansion and therefore should not be treated as options. This behavior is available only with the GNU C library, and only when <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> is not set.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1> Normally, exit status is 0 if selected lines are found and 1 otherwise. But the exit status is 2 if an error occurred, unless the <b>&#45;q</b> or <b>&#45;&#45;quiet</b> or <b>&#45;&#45;silent</b> option is used and a selected line is found.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS</h1> Email bug reports to <b>bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org</b>. Be sure to include the word &#8220;grep&#8221; somewhere in the &#8220;Subject:&#8221; field.<p>
Large repetition counts in the <b>{</b><i>n</i><b>,</b><i>m</i><b>}</b> construct may cause grep to use lots of memory. In addition, certain other obscure regular expressions require exponential time and space, and may cause <b>grep</b> to run out of memory.<p>
Backreferences are very slow, and may require exponential time.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
