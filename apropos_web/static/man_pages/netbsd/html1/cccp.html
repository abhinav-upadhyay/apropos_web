<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The C preprocessor, often known as  <i>cpp</i>, is a <i>macro processor</i> that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before compilation.  It is called a macro processor because it allows you to define  <i>macros</i>, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.<p>
The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and Objective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a general text processor.  It will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical rules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it preserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to C&#45;family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs will be removed, and the Makefile will not work.<p>
Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which are not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe (Pascal, Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.   <b>&#45;traditional&#45;cpp</b> mode preserves more white space, and is otherwise more permissive.  Many of the problems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments instead of native language comments, and keeping macros simple.<p>
Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language you are writing in.  Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macro facilities.  Most high level programming languages have their own conditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails, try a true general text processor, such as GNU M4.<p>
C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the GNU C preprocessor, which provides a small superset of the features of ISO Standard C.  In its default mode, the GNU C preprocessor does not do a few things required by the standard.  These are features which are rarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising changes to the meaning of a program which does not expect them.  To get strict ISO Standard C, you should use the  <b>&#45;std=c90</b>, <b>&#45;std=c99</b> or  <b>&#45;std=c11</b> options, depending on which version of the standard you want.  To get all the mandatory diagnostics, you must also use  <b>&#45;pedantic</b>.<p>
This manual describes the behavior of the ISO preprocessor.  To minimize gratuitous differences, where the ISO preprocessor's behavior does not conflict with traditional semantics, the traditional preprocessor should behave the same way.  The various differences that do exist are detailed in the section  <b>Traditional</b>  <b>Mode</b>.<p>
For clarity, unless noted otherwise, references to <b>CPP</b> in this manual refer to GNU CPP.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> The C preprocessor expects two file names as arguments,  <i>infile</i> and  <i>outfile</i>.  The preprocessor reads <i>infile</i> together with any other files it specifies with  <b>#include</b>.  All the output generated by the combined input files is written in  <i>outfile</i>.<p>
Either <i>infile</i> or <i>outfile</i> may be <b>&#45;</b>, which as  <i>infile</i> means to read from standard input and as <i>outfile</i> means to write to standard output.  Also, if either file is omitted, it means the same as if  <b>&#45;</b> had been specified for that file.<p>
Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in <b>=</b>, all options which take an argument may have that argument appear either immediately after the option, or with a space between option and argument:  <b>&#45;Ifoo</b> and <b>&#45;I foo</b> have the same effect.<p>
Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options may  <i>not</i> be grouped: <b>&#45;dM</b> is very different from  <b>&#45;d&#160;&#45;M</b>.<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;D</b> <i>name</i></dt>
<dd>
Predefine <i>name</i> as a macro, with definition 1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;D</b> <i>name</i><b>=</b><i>definition</i></dt>
<dd>
The contents of <i>definition</i> are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a  <b>#define</b> directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded newline characters.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need to quote the option.  With  <b>sh</b> and <b>csh</b>,  <b>&#45;D'</b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>args...</i><b>)=</b><i>definition</i><b>'</b> works.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>&#45;D</b> and <b>&#45;U</b> options are processed in the order they are given on the command line.  All  <b>&#45;imacros</b> <i>file</i> and  <b>&#45;include</b> <i>file</i> options are processed after all  <b>&#45;D</b> and <b>&#45;U</b> options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;U</b> <i>name</i></dt>
<dd>
Cancel any previous definition of <i>name</i>, either built in or provided with a  <b>&#45;D</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;undef</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The standard predefined macros remain defined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;I</b> <i>dir</i></dt>
<dd>
Add the directory <i>dir</i> to the list of directories to be searched for header files.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Directories named by <b>&#45;I</b> are searched before the standard system include directories.  If the directory  <i>dir</i> is a standard system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the default search order for system directories and the special treatment of system headers are not defeated . If  <i>dir</i> begins with "=", then the "=" will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see  <b>&#45;&#45;sysroot</b> and <b>&#45;isysroot</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;o</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
Write output to <i>file</i>.  This is the same as specifying <i>file</i> as the second non-option argument to  <b>cpp</b>.  <b>gcc</b> has a different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must use  <b>&#45;o</b> to specify the output file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;Wall</b></dt>
<dd>
Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code. At present this is  <b>&#45;Wcomment</b>, <b>&#45;Wtrigraphs</b>,  <b>&#45;Wmultichar</b> and a warning about integer promotion causing a change of sign in "#if" expressions.  Note that many of the preprocessor's warnings are on by default and have no options to control them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;Wcomment</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;Wcomments</b></dt>
<dd>
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <b>/*</b> appears in a <b>/*</b> comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a  <b>//</b> comment. (Both forms have the same effect.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;Wtrigraphs</b></dt>
<dd>
Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program. However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline ( <b>??/</b> at the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins or ends. Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce warnings inside a comment.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This option is implied by <b>&#45;Wall</b>.  If <b>&#45;Wall</b> is not given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other  <b>&#45;Wall</b> warnings, use <b>&#45;trigraphs &#45;Wall &#45;Wno&#45;trigraphs</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;Wtraditional</b></dt>
<dd>
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C equivalent, and problematic constructs which should be avoided.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;Wundef</b></dt>
<dd>
Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an  <b>#if</b> directive, outside of <b>defined</b>.  Such identifiers are replaced with zero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;Wunused&#45;macros</b></dt>
<dd>
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro is  <i>used</i> if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once. The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the time it is redefined or undefined.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros defined in include files are not warned about.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>Note:</i> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as unused.  To avoid the warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block. Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning<br>
        #endif<br>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;Wendif&#45;labels</b></dt>
<dd>
Warn whenever an <b>#else</b> or an <b>#endif</b> are followed by text. This usually happens in code of the form<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        #if FOO<br>
        ...<br>
        #else FOO<br>
        ...<br>
        #endif FOO<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The second and third "FOO" should be in comments, but often are not in older programs.  This warning is on by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;Werror</b></dt>
<dd>
Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings will be rejected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;Wsystem&#45;headers</b></dt>
<dd>
Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;w</b></dt>
<dd>
Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;pedantic</b></dt>
<dd>
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;pedantic&#45;errors</b></dt>
<dd>
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that GCC issues without  <b>&#45;pedantic</b> but treats as warnings.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;M</b></dt>
<dd>
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for  <b>make</b> describing the dependencies of the main source file.  The preprocessor outputs one  <b>make</b> rule containing the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the included files, including those coming from  <b>&#45;include</b> or  <b>&#45;imacros</b> command line options.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Unless specified explicitly (with <b>&#45;MT</b> or <b>&#45;MQ</b>), the object file name consists of the name of the source file with any suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is split into several lines using  <b>&#92;</b>&#45;newline.  The rule has no commands.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as  <b>&#45;dM</b>.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with  <b>&#45;MF</b>, or use an environment variable like  <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>.  Debug output will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Passing <b>&#45;M</b> to the driver implies <b>&#45;E</b>, and suppresses warnings with an implicit  <b>&#45;w</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;MM</b></dt>
<dd>
Like <b>&#45;M</b> but do not mention header files that are found in system header directories, nor header files that are included, directly or indirectly, from such a header.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an  <b>#include</b> directive does not in itself determine whether that header will appear in  <b>&#45;MM</b> dependency output.  This is a slight change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;MF</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
When used with <b>&#45;M</b> or <b>&#45;MM</b>, specifies a file to write the dependencies to.  If no  <b>&#45;MF</b> switch is given the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent preprocessed output.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When used with the driver options <b>&#45;MD</b> or <b>&#45;MMD</b>,  <b>&#45;MF</b> overrides the default dependency output file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;MG</b></dt>
<dd>
In conjunction with an option such as <b>&#45;M</b> requesting dependency generation,  <b>&#45;MG</b> assumes missing header files are generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the "#include" directive without prepending any path.   <b>&#45;MG</b> also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders this useless.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;MP</b></dt>
<dd>
This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These dummy rules work around errors  <b>make</b> gives if you remove header files without updating the  <i>Makefile</i> to match.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is typical output:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        test.o: test.c test.h<br>
        <br>
        test.h:<br>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;MT</b> <i>target</i></dt>
<dd>
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any directory components and any file suffix such as  <b>.c</b>, and appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An <b>&#45;MT</b> option will set the target to be exactly the string you specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single argument to  <b>&#45;MT</b>, or use multiple <b>&#45;MT</b> options.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For example, <b>&#45;MT&#160;'$(objpfx)foo.o'</b> might give<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c<br>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;MQ</b> <i>target</i></dt>
<dd>
Same as <b>&#45;MT</b>, but it quotes any characters which are special to Make.   <b>&#45;MQ&#160;'$(objpfx)foo.o'</b> gives<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with  <b>&#45;MQ</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;MD</b></dt>
<dd>
<b>&#45;MD</b> is equivalent to <b>&#45;M &#45;MF</b> <i>file</i>, except that  <b>&#45;E</b> is not implied.  The driver determines <i>file</i> based on whether an  <b>&#45;o</b> option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a suffix of  <i>.d</i>, otherwise it takes the name of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and applies a  <i>.d</i> suffix.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If <b>&#45;MD</b> is used in conjunction with <b>&#45;E</b>, any  <b>&#45;o</b> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without <b>&#45;E</b>, each <b>&#45;o</b> is understood to specify a target object file.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Since <b>&#45;E</b> is not implied, <b>&#45;MD</b> can be used to generate a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;MMD</b></dt>
<dd>
Like <b>&#45;MD</b> except mention only user header files, not system header files.</dd>

<b>&#45;x objective-c</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;x assembler-with-cpp</b></dt>
<dd>
Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options, cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:  <b>.c</b>, <b>.cc</b>, <b>.m</b>, or <b>.S</b>.  Some other common extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most generic mode.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>Note:</i> Previous versions of cpp accepted a <b>&#45;lang</b> option which selected both the language and the standards conformance level. This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the  <b>&#45;l</b> option.</dd>

<dt>
<b>&#45;iprefix</b> <i>prefix</i></dt>

<dd>
</dd>

<b>&#45;iwithprefixbefore</b> <i>dir</i></dt>
<dd>
Append <i>dir</i> to the prefix specified previously with  <b>&#45;iprefix</b>, and add the resulting directory to the include search path.   <b>&#45;iwithprefixbefore</b> puts it in the same place <b>&#45;I</b> would;  <b>&#45;iwithprefix</b> puts it where <b>&#45;idirafter</b> would.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;isysroot</b> <i>dir</i></dt>
<dd>
This option is like the <b>&#45;&#45;sysroot</b> option, but applies only to header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies to both header files and libraries).  See the  <b>&#45;&#45;sysroot</b> option for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;imultilib</b> <i>dir</i></dt>

<b>&#45;isystem</b> <i>dir</i></dt>
<dd>
Search <i>dir</i> for header files, after all directories specified by  <b>&#45;I</b> but before the standard system directories.  Mark it as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as is applied to the standard system directories.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;fdirectives&#45;only</b></dt>
<dd>
When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The option's behavior depends on the <b>&#45;E</b> and <b>&#45;fpreprocessed</b> options.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With <b>&#45;E</b>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives such as "#define", "#ifdef", and "#error".  Other preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph conversion are not performed.  In addition, the  <b>&#45;dD</b> option is implicitly enabled.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With <b>&#45;fpreprocessed</b>, predefinition of command line and most builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as "__LINE__", which are contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of files previously preprocessed with "&#45;E &#45;fdirectives&#45;only".<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With both <b>&#45;E</b> and <b>&#45;fpreprocessed</b>, the rules for  <b>&#45;fpreprocessed</b> take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of files previously preprocessed with "&#45;E &#45;fdirectives&#45;only".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;iremap</b> <i>src</i><b>:</b><i>dst</i></dt>
<dd>
Replace the prefix <i>src</i> in __FILE__ with <i>dst</i> at expansion time. This option can be specified more than once.  Processing stops at the first match.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;fdollars&#45;in&#45;identifiers</b></dt>
<dd>
Accept <b>$</b> in identifiers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;fextended&#45;identifiers</b></dt>
<dd>
Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is experimental; in a future version of GCC, it will be enabled by default for C99 and C++.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;fno&#45;canonical&#45;system&#45;headers</b></dt>
<dd>
When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;fpreprocessed</b></dt>
<dd>
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives. The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can pass a file preprocessed with  <b>&#45;C</b> to the compiler without problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>&#45;fpreprocessed</b> is implicit if the input file has one of the extensions  <b>.i</b>, <b>.ii</b> or <b>.mi</b>.  These are the extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by  <b>&#45;save&#45;temps</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;ftabstop=</b><i>width</i></dt>
<dd>
Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is ignored.  The default is 8.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;fdebug&#45;cpp</b></dt>
<dd>
This option is only useful for debugging GCC.  When used with  <b>&#45;E</b>, dumps debugging information about location maps.  Every token in the output is preceded by the dump of the map its location belongs to.  The dump of the map holding the location of a token would be:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        {"P":F&lt;/file/path&gt;;"F":F&lt;/includer/path&gt;;"L":&lt;line_num&gt;;"C":&lt;col_num&gt;;"S":&lt;system_header_p&gt;;"M":&lt;map_address&gt;;"E":&lt;macro_expansion_p&gt;,"loc":&lt;location&gt;}<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When used without <b>&#45;E</b>, this option has no effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;ftrack&#45;macro&#45;expansion</b>[<b>=</b><i>level</i>]</dt>
<dd>
Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more memory. The  <i>level</i> parameter can be used to choose the level of precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if necessary. Value  <b>0</b> of <i>level</i> de-activates this option just as if no  <b>&#45;ftrack&#45;macro&#45;expansion</b> was present on the command line. Value  <b>1</b> tracks tokens locations in a degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a function-like macro have the same location. Value  <b>2</b> tracks tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry. When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is  <b>2</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that &#45;ftrack&#45;macro&#45;expansion=2 is activated by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;fexec&#45;charset=</b><i>charset</i></dt>
<dd>
Set the execution character set, used for string and character constants.  The default is UTF&#45;8.   <i>charset</i> can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;fwide&#45;exec&#45;charset=</b><i>charset</i></dt>
<dd>
Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and character constants.  The default is UTF&#45;32 or UTF&#45;16, whichever corresponds to the width of "wchar_t".  As with  <b>&#45;fexec&#45;charset</b>, <i>charset</i> can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine; however, you will have problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in "wchar_t".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;finput&#45;charset=</b><i>charset</i></dt>
<dd>
Set the input character set, used for translation from the character set of the input file to the source character set used by GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this information from the locale, the default is UTF&#45;8.  This can be overridden by either the locale or this command line option.  Currently the command line option takes precedence if there's a conflict.   <i>charset</i> can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;fworking&#45;directory</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the current working directory followed by two slashes.  GCC will use this directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated form  <b>&#45;fno&#45;working&#45;directory</b>.  If the <b>&#45;P</b> flag is present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no "#line" directives are emitted whatsoever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;fno&#45;show&#45;column</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not understand the column numbers, such as  <b>dejagnu</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;A</b> <i>predicate</i><b>=</b><i>answer</i></dt>
<dd>
Make an assertion with the predicate <i>predicate</i> and answer  <i>answer</i>.  This form is preferred to the older form <b>&#45;A</b>  <i>predicate</i><b>(</b><i>answer</i><b>)</b>, which is still supported, because it does not use shell special characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;A &#45;</b><i>predicate</i><b>=</b><i>answer</i></dt>
<dd>
Cancel an assertion with the predicate <i>predicate</i> and answer  <i>answer</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;dCHARS</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>CHARS</i> is a sequence of one or more of the following characters, and must not be preceded by a space.  Other characters are interpreted by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and so are silently ignored.  If you specify characters whose behavior conflicts, the result is undefined.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
<b>M</b></dt>
<dd>
Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <b>#define</b> directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a way of finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor. Assuming you have no file  <i>foo.h</i>, the command<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br>
        touch foo.h; cpp &#45;dM foo.h<br>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
will show all the predefined macros.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you use <b>&#45;dM</b> without the <b>&#45;E</b> option, <b>&#45;dM</b> is interpreted as a synonym for  <b>&#45;fdump&#45;rtl&#45;mach</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>D</b></dt>
<dd>
Like <b>M</b> except in two respects: it does <i>not</i> include the predefined macros, and it outputs  <i>both</i> the <b>#define</b> directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to the standard output file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>N</b></dt>
<dd>
Like <b>D</b>, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>I</b></dt>
<dd>
Output <b>#include</b> directives in addition to the result of preprocessing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>U</b></dt>
<dd>
Like <b>D</b> except that only macros that are expanded, or whose definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output; the output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and  <b>#undef</b> directives are also output for macros tested but undefined at the time.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;P</b></dt>
<dd>
Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor. This might be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the linemarkers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;C</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted along with the directive.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You should be prepared for side effects when using <b>&#45;C</b>; it causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right. For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a  <b>#</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#45;CC</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is like  <b>&#45;C</b>, except that comments contained within macros are also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In addition to the side-effects of the <b>&#45;C</b> option, the  <b>&#45;CC</b> option causes all C++&#45;style comments inside a macro to be converted to C&#45;style comments.  This is to prevent later use of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <b>&#45;CC</b> option is generally used to support lint comments.</dd>

</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1> This section describes the environment variables that affect how CPP operates.  You can use them to specify directories or prefixes to use when searching for include files, or to control dependency output.<p>
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as  <b>&#45;I</b>, and control dependency output with options like  <b>&#45;M</b>.  These take precedence over environment variables, which in turn take precedence over the configuration of GCC.<dl>
<dt>
<b>CPATH</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>C_INCLUDE_PATH</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</b></dt>
<dd>
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special character, much like  <b>PATH</b>, in which to look for header files. The special character, "PATH_SEPARATOR", is target-dependent and determined at GCC build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>CPATH</b> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified with  <b>&#45;I</b>, but after any paths given with <b>&#45;I</b> options on the command line.  This environment variable is used regardless of which language is being preprocessed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified with  <b>&#45;isystem</b>, but after any paths given with  <b>&#45;isystem</b> options on the command line.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of  <b>CPATH</b> is ":/special/include", that has the same effect as  <b>&#45;I.&#160;&#45;I/special/include</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b></dt>
<dd>
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency output.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The value of <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> can be just a file name, in which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form  <i>file</i><b> </b><i>target</i>, in which case the rules are written to file  <i>file</i> using <i>target</i> as the target name.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining the options  <b>&#45;MM</b> and <b>&#45;MF</b>, with an optional  <b>&#45;MT</b> switch too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</b></dt>
<dd>
This variable is the same as <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> (see above), except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies  <b>&#45;M</b> rather than <b>&#45;MM</b>.  However, the dependence on the main input file is omitted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>CPP_RESTRICTED</b></dt>
<dd>
If this variable is defined, cpp will skip any include file which is not a regular file, and will continue searching for the requested name (this is always done if the found file is a directory).</dd>
</dl>
