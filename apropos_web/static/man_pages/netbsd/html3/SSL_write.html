<h1>NAME</h1> SSL_write &#45; write bytes to a TLS/SSL connection.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>LIBRARY</h1> libcrypto, -lcrypto</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br>
 #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;<br>
<br>
 int SSL_write(SSL *ssl, const void *buf, int num);<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <i>SSL_write()</i> writes <b>num</b> bytes from the buffer <b>buf</b> into the specified  <b>ssl</b> connection.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> If necessary,  <i>SSL_write()</i> will negotiate a TLS/SSL session, if not already explicitly performed by  <i>SSL_connect</i>(3) or  <i>SSL_accept</i>(3). If the peer requests a re-negotiation, it will be performed transparently during the  <i>SSL_write()</i> operation. The behaviour of <i>SSL_write()</i> depends on the underlying BIO. <p>
For the transparent negotiation to succeed, the <b>ssl</b> must have been initialized to client or server mode. This is being done by calling  <i>SSL_set_connect_state</i>(3) or <i>SSL_set_accept_state()</i> before the first call to an  <i>SSL_read</i>(3) or <i>SSL_write()</i> function.<p>
If the underlying BIO is <b>blocking</b>, <i>SSL_write()</i> will only return, once the write operation has been finished or an error occurred, except when a renegotiation take place, in which case a SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ may occur. This behaviour can be controlled with the SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag of the  <i>SSL_CTX_set_mode</i>(3) call.<p>
If the underlying BIO is <b>non-blocking</b>, <i>SSL_write()</i> will also return, when the underlying BIO could not satisfy the needs of  <i>SSL_write()</i> to continue the operation. In this case a call to  <i>SSL_get_error</i>(3) with the return value of  <i>SSL_write()</i> will yield <b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</b> or  <b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</b>. As at any time a re-negotiation is possible, a call to  <i>SSL_write()</i> can also cause read operations! The calling process then must repeat the call after taking appropriate action to satisfy the needs of  <i>SSL_write()</i>. The action depends on the underlying BIO. When using a non-blocking socket, nothing is to be done, but  <i>select()</i> can be used to check for the required condition. When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO pair, data must be written into or retrieved out of the BIO before being able to continue.<p>
<i>SSL_write()</i> will only return with success, when the complete contents of  <b>buf</b> of length <b>num</b> has been written. This default behaviour can be changed with the SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE option of  <i>SSL_CTX_set_mode</i>(3). When this flag is set,  <i>SSL_write()</i> will also return with success, when a partial write has been successfully completed. In this case the  <i>SSL_write()</i> operation is considered completed. The bytes are sent and a new  <i>SSL_write()</i> operation with a new buffer (with the already sent bytes removed) must be started. A partial write is performed with the size of a message block, which is 16kB for SSLv3/TLSv1.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>WARNING</h1> When an  <i>SSL_write()</i> operation has to be repeated because of  <b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</b> or <b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</b>, it must be repeated with the same arguments.<p>
When calling <i>SSL_write()</i> with num=0 bytes to be sent the behaviour is undefined.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUES</h1> The following return values can occur:<dl>
<dt>
&gt;0</dt>
<dd>
The write operation was successful, the return value is the number of bytes actually written to the TLS/SSL connection.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
0</dt>
<dd>
The write operation was not successful. Probably the underlying connection was closed. Call  <i>SSL_get_error()</i> with the return value <b>ret</b> to find out, whether an error occurred or the connection was shut down cleanly (SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
SSLv2 (deprecated) does not support a shutdown alert protocol, so it can only be detected, whether the underlying connection was closed. It cannot be checked, why the closure happened.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&lt;0</dt>
<dd>
The write operation was not successful, because either an error occurred or action must be taken by the calling process. Call  <i>SSL_get_error()</i> with the return value  <b>ret</b> to find out the reason.</dd>
</dl>
