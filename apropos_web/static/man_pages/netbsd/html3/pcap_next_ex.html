<h1>NAME</h1> pcap_next_ex, pcap_next &#45; read the next packet from a pcap_t</div>

<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br>
#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;<p>
<br>
int pcap_next_ex(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_pkthdr **pkt_header,<br>
const u_char **pkt_data);<br>
const u_char *pcap_next(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_pkthdr *h);<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <b>pcap_next_ex()</b> reads the next packet and returns a success/failure indication. If the packet was read without problems, the pointer pointed to by the <i>pkt_header</i> argument is set to point to the <i>pcap_pkthdr</i> struct for the packet, and the pointer pointed to by the <i>pkt_data</i> argument is set to point to the data in the packet.  The <i>struct pcap_pkthdr</i> and the packet data are not to be freed by the caller, and are not guaranteed to be valid after the next call to <b>pcap_next_ex()</b>, <b>pcap_next()</b>, <b>pcap_loop()</b>, or <b>pcap_dispatch()</b>; if the code needs them to remain valid, it must make a copy of them.<p>
<b>pcap_next()</b> reads the next packet (by calling <b>pcap_dispatch()</b> with a <i>cnt</i> of 1) and returns a <i>u_char</i> pointer to the data in that packet.  The packet data is not to be freed by the caller, and is not guaranteed to be valid after the next call to <b>pcap_next_ex()</b>, <b>pcap_next()</b>, <b>pcap_loop()</b>, or <b>pcap_dispatch()</b>; if the code needs it to remain valid, it must make a copy of it. The <i>pcap_pkthdr</i> structure pointed to by <i>h</i> is filled in with the appropriate values for the packet.<p>
The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.  The format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the <b>pcap_datalink()</b> routine when handed the <b>pcap_t</b> value also passed to <b>pcap_loop()</b> or <b>pcap_dispatch()</b>. <i>http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes</i> lists the values <b>pcap_datalink()</b> can return and describes the packet formats that correspond to those values.  The value it returns will be valid for all packets received unless and until <b>pcap_set_datalink()</b> is called; after a successful call to <b>pcap_set_datalink()</b>, all subsequent packets will have a link-layer header of the type specified by the link-layer header type value passed to <b>pcap_set_datalink()</b>.<p>
Do <b>NOT</b> assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile`` will have any given link-layer header type, such as <b>DLT_EN10MB</b> for Ethernet.  For example, the "any" device on Linux will have a link-layer header type of <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL</b> even if all devices on the system at the time the "any" device is opened have some other data link type, such as <b>DLT_EN10MB</b> for Ethernet.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> <b>pcap_next_ex()</b> returns 1 if the packet was read without problems, 0 if packets are being read from a live capture and the timeout expired, &#45;1 if an error occurred while reading the packet, and &#45;2 if packets are being read from a ``savefile'' and there are no more packets to read from the savefile. If &#45;1 is returned, <b>pcap_geterr()</b> or <b>pcap_perror()</b> may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to fetch or display the error text.<p>
<b>pcap_next()</b> returns a pointer to the packet data on success, and returns <b>NULL</b> if an error occurred, or if no packets were read from a live capture (if, for example, they were discarded because they didn't pass the packet filter, or if, on platforms that support a read timeout that starts before any packets arrive, the timeout expires before any packets arrive, or if the file descriptor for the capture device is in non-blocking mode and no packets were available to be read), or if no more packets are available in a ``savefile.''  Unfortunately, there is no way to determine whether an error occurred or not.</div>
