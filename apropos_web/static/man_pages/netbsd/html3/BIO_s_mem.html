<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <i>BIO_s_mem()</i> return the memory BIO method function.<p>
A memory BIO is a source/sink BIO which uses memory for its I/O. Data written to a memory BIO is stored in a BUF_MEM structure which is extended as appropriate to accommodate the stored data.<p>
Any data written to a memory BIO can be recalled by reading from it. Unless the memory BIO is read only any data read from it is deleted from the BIO.<p>
Memory BIOs support <i>BIO_gets()</i> and <i>BIO_puts()</i>.<p>
If the BIO_CLOSE flag is set when a memory BIO is freed then the underlying BUF_MEM structure is also freed.<p>
Calling <i>BIO_reset()</i> on a read write memory BIO clears any data in it. On a read only BIO it restores the BIO to its original state and the read only data can be read again.<p>
<i>BIO_eof()</i> is true if no data is in the BIO.<p>
<i>BIO_ctrl_pending()</i> returns the number of bytes currently stored.<p>
<i>BIO_set_mem_eof_return()</i> sets the behaviour of memory BIO <b>b</b> when it is empty. If the  <b>v</b> is zero then an empty memory BIO will return EOF (that is it will return zero and BIO_should_retry(b) will be false. If  <b>v</b> is non zero then it will return  <b>v</b> when it is empty and it will set the read retry flag (that is BIO_read_retry(b) is true). To avoid ambiguity with a normal positive return value  <b>v</b> should be set to a negative value, typically &#45;1.<p>
<i>BIO_get_mem_data()</i> sets <b>pp</b> to a pointer to the start of the memory BIOs data and returns the total amount of data available. It is implemented as a macro.<p>
<i>BIO_set_mem_buf()</i> sets the internal BUF_MEM structure to <b>bm</b> and sets the close flag to  <b>c</b>, that is <b>c</b> should be either BIO_CLOSE or BIO_NOCLOSE. It is a macro.<p>
<i>BIO_get_mem_ptr()</i> places the underlying BUF_MEM structure in <b>pp</b>. It is a macro.<p>
<i>BIO_new_mem_buf()</i> creates a memory BIO using <b>len</b> bytes of data at <b>buf</b>, if  <b>len</b> is &#45;1 then the <b>buf</b> is assumed to be null terminated and its length is determined by  <b>strlen</b>. The BIO is set to a read only state and as a result cannot be written to. This is useful when some data needs to be made available from a static area of memory in the form of a BIO. The supplied data is read directly from the supplied buffer: it is  <b>not</b> copied first, so the supplied area of memory must be unchanged until the BIO is freed.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> Writes to memory BIOs will always succeed if memory is available: that is their size can grow indefinitely.<p>
Every read from a read write memory BIO will remove the data just read with an internal copy operation, if a BIO contains a lot of data and it is read in small chunks the operation can be very slow. The use of a read only memory BIO avoids this problem. If the BIO must be read write then adding a buffering BIO to the chain will speed up the process.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS</h1> There should be an option to set the maximum size of a memory BIO.<p>
There should be a way to "rewind" a read write BIO without destroying its contents.<p>
The copying operation should not occur after every small read of a large BIO to improve efficiency.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLE</h1> Create a memory BIO and write some data to it:<p>
<br>
 BIO *mem = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());<br>
 BIO_puts(mem, "Hello World&#92;n");<br>
<p>
Create a read only memory BIO:<p>
<br>
 char data[] = "Hello World";<br>
 BIO *mem;<br>
 mem = BIO_new_mem_buf(data, &#45;1);<br>
<p>
Extract the BUF_MEM structure from a memory BIO and then free up the BIO:<p>
<br>
 BUF_MEM *bptr;<br>
 BIO_get_mem_ptr(mem, &amp;bptr);<br>
 BIO_set_close(mem, BIO_NOCLOSE); /* So BIO_free() leaves BUF_MEM alone */<br>
 BIO_free(mem);<br>
