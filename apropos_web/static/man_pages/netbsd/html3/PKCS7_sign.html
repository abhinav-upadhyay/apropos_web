<h1>NAME</h1> PKCS7_sign &#45; create a PKCS#7 signedData structure</div>

<h1>LIBRARY</h1> libcrypto, -lcrypto</div>

<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br>
 #include &lt;openssl/pkcs7.h&gt;<br>
<br>
 PKCS7 *PKCS7_sign(X509 *signcert, EVP_PKEY *pkey, STACK_OF(X509) *certs, BIO *data, int flags);<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <i>PKCS7_sign()</i> creates and returns a PKCS#7 signedData structure. <b>signcert</b> is the certificate to sign with,  <b>pkey</b> is the corresponsding private key.  <b>certs</b> is an optional additional set of certificates to include in the PKCS#7 structure (for example any intermediate CAs in the chain).<p>
The data to be signed is read from BIO <b>data</b>.<p>
<b>flags</b> is an optional set of flags.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> Any of the following flags (ored together) can be passed in the  <b>flags</b> parameter.<p>
Many S/MIME clients expect the signed content to include valid MIME headers. If the  <b>PKCS7_TEXT</b> flag is set MIME headers for type <b>text/plain</b> are prepended to the data.<p>
If <b>PKCS7_NOCERTS</b> is set the signer's certificate will not be included in the PKCS7 structure, the signer's certificate must still be supplied in the  <b>signcert</b> parameter though. This can reduce the size of the signature if the signers certificate can be obtained by other means: for example a previously signed message.<p>
The data being signed is included in the PKCS7 structure, unless  <b>PKCS7_DETACHED</b> is set in which case it is omitted. This is used for PKCS7 detached signatures which are used in S/MIME plaintext signed messages for example.<p>
Normally the supplied content is translated into MIME canonical format (as required by the S/MIME specifications) if  <b>PKCS7_BINARY</b> is set no translation occurs. This option should be used if the supplied data is in binary format otherwise the translation will corrupt it.<p>
The signedData structure includes several PKCS#7 autenticatedAttributes including the signing time, the PKCS#7 content type and the supported list of ciphers in an SMIMECapabilities attribute. If  <b>PKCS7_NOATTR</b> is set then no authenticatedAttributes will be used. If  <b>PKCS7_NOSMIMECAP</b> is set then just the SMIMECapabilities are omitted.<p>
If present the SMIMECapabilities attribute indicates support for the following algorithms: triple DES, 128 bit RC2, 64 bit RC2, DES and 40 bit RC2. If any of these algorithms is disabled then it will not be included.<p>
If the flags <b>PKCS7_STREAM</b> is set then the returned <b>PKCS7</b> structure is just initialized ready to perform the signing operation. The signing is however  <b>not</b> performed and the data to be signed is not read from the <b>data</b> parameter. Signing is deferred until after the data has been written. In this way data can be signed in a single pass.<p>
If the <b>PKCS7_PARTIAL</b> flag is set a partial <b>PKCS7</b> structure is output to which additional signers and capabilities can be added before finalization.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> If the flag  <b>PKCS7_STREAM</b> is set the returned <b>PKCS7</b> structure is <b>not</b> complete and outputting its contents via a function that does not properly finalize the  <b>PKCS7</b> structure will give unpredictable results.<p>
Several functions including <i>SMIME_write_PKCS7()</i>, <i>i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream()</i>,  <i>PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream()</i> finalize the structure. Alternatively finalization can be performed by obtaining the streaming ASN1  <b>BIO</b> directly using  <i>BIO_new_PKCS7()</i>.<p>
If a signer is specified it will use the default digest for the signing algorithm. This is  <b>SHA1</b> for both RSA and DSA keys.<p>
In OpenSSL 1.0.0 the <b>certs</b>, <b>signcert</b> and <b>pkey</b> parameters can all be  <b>NULL</b> if the <b>PKCS7_PARTIAL</b> flag is set. One or more signers can be added using the function  <b></b><b><i>PKCS7_sign_add_signer()</i></b><b></b>. <b></b><b><i>PKCS7_final()</i></b><b></b> must also be called to finalize the structure if streaming is not enabled. Alternative signing digests can also be specified using this method.<p>
In OpenSSL 1.0.0 if <b>signcert</b> and <b>pkey</b> are NULL then a certificates only PKCS#7 structure is output.<p>
In versions of OpenSSL before 1.0.0 the <b>signcert</b> and <b>pkey</b> parameters must  <b>NOT</b> be NULL.</div>

<h1>BUGS</h1> Some advanced attributes such as counter signatures are not supported.</div>

<h1>RETURN VALUES</h1>  <i>PKCS7_sign()</i> returns either a valid PKCS7 structure or NULL if an error occurred.  The error can be obtained from  <i>ERR_get_error</i>(3).</div>
