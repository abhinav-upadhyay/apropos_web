<div class="section">
<h1 id="x4445534352495054494f4e">DESCRIPTION</h1> Symbolic links are files that act as pointers to other files. To understand their behavior, you must first understand how hard links work.<p>
A hard link to a file is indistinguishable from the original file because it is a reference to the object underlying the original file name. Changes to a file are independent of the name used to reference the file. Hard links may not refer to directories and may not reference files on different file systems.<p>
A symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is linked, i.e. it is a pointer to another name, and not to an underlying object. For this reason, symbolic links may reference directories and may span file systems.<p>
Because a symbolic link and its referenced object coexist in the filesystem name space, confusion can arise in distinguishing between the link itself and the referenced object. Historically, commands and system calls have adopted their own link following conventions in a somewhat ad-hoc fashion. Rules for more a uniform approach, as they are implemented in this system, are outlined here. It is important that local applications conform to these rules, too, so that the user interface can be as consistent as possible.<p>
Symbolic links are handled either by operating on the link itself, or by operating on the object referenced by the link. In the latter case, an application or system call is said to &#8220;follow&#8221; the link.<p>
Symbolic links may reference other symbolic links, in which case the links are dereferenced until an object that is not a symbolic link is found, a symbolic link which references a file which doesn't exist is found, or a loop is detected. Loop detection is done by placing an upper limit on the number of links that may be followed, and an error results if this limit is exceeded.<p>
There are three separate areas that need to be discussed. They are as follows:<p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="list list-enum">
<li class="list-enum" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
Symbolic links used as file name arguments for system calls.</li>
<li class="list-enum" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
Symbolic links specified as command line arguments to utilities that are not traversing a file tree.</li>
<li class="list-enum" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
Symbolic links encountered by utilities that are traversing a file tree (either specified on the command line or encountered as part of the file hierarchy walk).</li>
</ol>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x53797374656d2063616c6c73">System calls</h2> The first area is symbolic links used as file name arguments for system calls.<p>
Except as noted below, all system calls follow symbolic links. For example, if there were a symbolic link &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221; which pointed to a file named &#8220;<code class="lit">afile</code>&#8221;, the system call &#8220;<code class="lit">open("slink" ...)</code>&#8221; would return a file descriptor to the file &#8220;afile&#8221;.<p>
There are eight system calls that do not follow links, and which operate on the symbolic link itself. They are: <a class="link-man" href="../2/lchflags">lchflags(2)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../2/lchmod">lchmod(2)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../2/lchown">lchown(2)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../2/lstat">lstat(2)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../2/lutimes">lutimes(2)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../2/readlink">readlink(2)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../2/rename">rename(2)</a>, and <a class="link-man" href="../2/unlink">unlink(2)</a>. Because <a class="link-man" href="../3/remove">remove(3)</a> is an alias for <a class="link-man" href="../2/unlink">unlink(2)</a>, it also does not follow symbolic links.<p>
The <span class="unix">4.4BSD</span> system differs from historical <span class="unix">4BSD</span> systems in that the system call <a class="link-man" href="../2/chown">chown(2)</a> has been changed to follow symbolic links.<p>
If the filesystem is mounted with the <span class="emph">symperm</span> <a class="link-man" href="../8/mount">mount(8)</a> option, the symbolic link file permission bits have the following effects:<p>
The <a class="link-man" href="../2/readlink">readlink(2)</a> system call requires read permissions on the symbolic link.<p>
System calls that follow symbolic links will fail without execute/search permissions on all the symbolic links followed.<p>
The write, sticky, set-user-ID-on-execution and set-group-ID-on-execution symbolic link mode bits have no effect on any system calls (including <a class="link-man" href="../2/execve">execve(2)</a>).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x436f6d6d616e6473206e6f742074726176657273696e6720612066696c652074726565">Commands not traversing a file tree</h2> The second area is symbolic links, specified as command line file name arguments, to commands which are not traversing a file tree.<p>
Except as noted below, commands follow symbolic links named as command line arguments. For example, if there were a symbolic link &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221; which pointed to a file named &#8220;<code class="lit">afile</code>&#8221;, the command &#8220;<code class="lit">cat slink</code>&#8221; would display the contents of the file &#8220;<code class="lit">afile</code>&#8221;.<p>
It is important to realize that this rule includes commands which may optionally traverse file trees, e.g. the command &#8220;<code class="lit">chown file</code>&#8221; is included in this rule, while the command &#8220;<code class="lit">chown -R file</code>&#8221; is not (The latter is described in the third area, below).<p>
If it is explicitly intended that the command operate on the symbolic link instead of following the symbolic link, e.g., it is desired that &#8220;<code class="lit">file slink</code>&#8221; display the type of file that &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221; is, whether it is a symbolic link or not, the <b class="flag">&#45;h</b> option should be used. In the above example, &#8220;<code class="lit">file slink</code>&#8221; would report the type of the file referenced by &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221;, while &#8220;<code class="lit">file -h slink</code>&#8221; would report that &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221; was a symbolic link.<p>
There are three exceptions to this rule. The <a class="link-man" href="../1/mv">mv(1)</a> and <a class="link-man" href="../1/rm">rm(1)</a> commands do not follow symbolic links named as arguments, but respectively attempt to rename and delete them. (Note, if the symbolic link references a file via a relative path, moving it to another directory may very well cause it to stop working, since the path may no longer be correct).<p>
The <a class="link-man" href="../1/ls">ls(1)</a> command is also an exception to this rule. For compatibility with historic systems (when <b class="name">ls</b> is not doing a tree walk, i.e. the <b class="flag">&#45;R</b> option is not specified), the <b class="name">ls</b> command follows symbolic links named as arguments if the <b class="flag">&#45;L</b> option is specified, or if the <b class="flag">&#45;F</b>, <b class="flag">&#45;d</b> or <b class="flag">&#45;l</b> options are not specified. (If the <b class="flag">&#45;L</b> option is specified, <b class="name">ls</b> always follows symbolic links. <b class="name">ls</b> is the only command where the <b class="flag">&#45;L</b> option affects its behavior even though it is not doing a walk of a file tree).<p>
The <span class="unix">4.4BSD</span> system differs from historical <span class="unix">4BSD</span> systems in that the <b class="name">chown</b>, <b class="name">chgrp</b> and <b class="name">file</b> commands follow symbolic links specified on the command line.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="x436f6d6d616e64732074726176657273696e6720612066696c652074726565">Commands traversing a file tree</h2> The following commands either optionally or always traverse file trees: <a class="link-man" href="../1/chflags">chflags(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/chgrp">chgrp(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/chmod">chmod(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/cp">cp(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/du">du(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/find">find(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/ls">ls(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/pax">pax(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/rm">rm(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/tar">tar(1)</a> and <a class="link-man" href="../8/chown">chown(8)</a>.<p>
It is important to realize that the following rules apply equally to symbolic links encountered during the file tree traversal and symbolic links listed as command line arguments.<p>
The first rule applies to symbolic links that reference files that are not of type directory. Operations that apply to symbolic links are performed on the links themselves, but otherwise the links are ignored.<p>
For example, the command &#8220;<code class="lit">chown -R user slink directory</code>&#8221; will ignore &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221;, because the <b class="flag">&#45;h</b> flag must be used to change owners of symbolic links. Any symbolic links encountered during the tree traversal will also be ignored. The command &#8220;<code class="lit">rm -r slink directory</code>&#8221; will remove &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221;, as well as any symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal of &#8220;<code class="lit">directory</code>&#8221;, because symbolic links may be removed. In no case will either <b class="name">chown</b> or <b class="name">rm</b> affect the file which &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221; references in any way.<p>
The second rule applies to symbolic links that reference files of type directory. Symbolic links which reference files of type directory are never &#8220;followed&#8221; by default. This is often referred to as a &#8220;physical&#8221; walk, as opposed to a &#8220;logical&#8221; walk (where symbolic links referencing directories are followed).<p>
As consistently as possible, you can make commands doing a file tree walk follow any symbolic links named on the command line, regardless of the type of file they reference, by specifying the <b class="flag">&#45;H</b> (for &#8220;half&#45;logical&#8221;) flag. This flag is intended to make the command line name space look like the logical name space. (Note, for commands that do not always do file tree traversals, the <b class="flag">&#45;H</b> flag will be ignored if the <b class="flag">&#45;R</b> flag is not also specified).<p>
For example, the command &#8220;<code class="lit">chown -HR user slink</code>&#8221; will traverse the file hierarchy rooted in the file pointed to by &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221;. Note, the <b class="flag">&#45;H</b> is not the same as the previously discussed <b class="flag">&#45;h</b> flag. The <b class="flag">&#45;H</b> flag causes symbolic links specified on the command line to be dereferenced both for the purposes of the action to be performed and the tree walk, and it is as if the user had specified the name of the file to which the symbolic link pointed.<p>
As consistently as possible, you can make commands doing a file tree walk follow any symbolic links named on the command line, as well as any symbolic links encountered during the traversal, regardless of the type of file they reference, by specifying the <b class="flag">&#45;L</b> (for &#8220;logical&#8221;) flag. This flag is intended to make the entire name space look like the logical name space. (Note, for commands that do not always do file tree traversals, the <b class="flag">&#45;L</b> flag will be ignored if the <b class="flag">&#45;R</b> flag is not also specified).<p>
For example, the command &#8220;<code class="lit">chown -LR user slink</code>&#8221; will change the owner of the file referenced by &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221;. If &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221; references a directory, <b class="name">chown</b> will traverse the file hierarchy rooted in the directory that it references. In addition, if any symbolic links are encountered in any file tree that <b class="name">chown</b> traverses, they will be treated in the same fashion as &#8220;<code class="lit">slink</code>&#8221;.<p>
As consistently as possible, you can specify the default behavior by specifying the <b class="flag">&#45;P</b> (for &#8220;physical&#8221;) flag. This flag is intended to make the entire name space look like the physical name space.<p>
For commands that do not by default do file tree traversals, the <b class="flag">&#45;H</b>, <b class="flag">&#45;L</b> and <b class="flag">&#45;P</b> flags are ignored if the <b class="flag">&#45;R</b> flag is not also specified. In addition, you may specify the <b class="flag">&#45;H</b>, <b class="flag">&#45;L</b> and <b class="flag">&#45;P</b> options more than once; the last one specified determines the command's behavior. This is intended to permit you to alias commands to behave one way or the other, and then override that behavior on the command line.<p>
The <a class="link-man" href="../1/ls">ls(1)</a> and <a class="link-man" href="../1/rm">rm(1)</a> commands have exceptions to these rules. The <b class="name">rm</b> command operates on the symbolic link, and not the file it references, and therefore never follows a symbolic link. The <b class="name">rm</b> command does not support the <b class="flag">&#45;H</b>, <b class="flag">&#45;L</b> or <b class="flag">&#45;P</b> options.<p>
To maintain compatibility with historic systems, the <b class="name">ls</b> command never follows symbolic links unless the <b class="flag">&#45;L</b> flag is specified. If the <b class="flag">&#45;L</b> flag is specified, <b class="name">ls</b> follows all symbolic links, regardless of their type, whether specified on the command line or encountered in the tree walk. The <b class="name">ls</b> command does not support the <b class="flag">&#45;H</b> or <b class="flag">&#45;P</b> options.</div>

<h2 id="x4d616769632073796d6c696e6b73">Magic symlinks</h2> So-called &#8220;magic symlinks&#8221; can be enabled by setting the &#8220;vfs.generic.magiclinks&#8221; variable with <a class="link-man" href="../8/sysctl">sysctl(8)</a>. When magic symlinks are enabled &#8220;magic&#8221; patterns in symlinks are expanded. Those patterns begin with &#8220;@&#8221; (an at-sign), and end at the end of the pathname component (i.e. at the next &#8220;/&#8221;, or at the end of the symbolic link if there are no more slashes).<p>
To illustrate the pattern matching rules, assume that &#8220;@foo&#8221; is a valid magic string:<p>
<dl style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="list list-tag">
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
@foo</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 13.00ex;">
would be matched</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
@foo/bar</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 13.00ex;">
would be matched</dd>
<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
bar@foo</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 13.00ex;">

<dt class="list-tag" style="margin-top: 0.00em;">
@foobar</dt>
<dd class="list-tag" style="margin-left: 13.00ex;">
would not be matched</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Magic strings may also be delimited with &#8216;{&#8217; and &#8216;}&#8217; characters, allowing for more complex patterns in symbolic links such as:<p>
<pre style="margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="lit display">
@{var1}-@{var2}.@{var3}</pre>
<p>
The following patterns are supported:<dl style="margin-top: 0.00em;margin-bottom: 0.00em;margin-left: 5.00ex;" class="list list-tag">
