<div class="section">
<h1 id="x53594e4f50534953">SYNOPSIS</h1> Special. See below.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x4445534352495054494f4e">DESCRIPTION</h1> Once upon time, the only Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) software easily available was &#8220;sendmail&#8221;. This famous MTA was written by <span class="author">Eric Allman</span> and first appeared in <span class="unix">4.1BSD</span>. The legacy of this MTA affected most Mail User Agents (MUAs) such as <a class="link-man" href="../1/mail">mail(1)</a>; the path and calling conventions expected by &#8220;sendmail&#8221; were compiled in.<p>
But times changed. On a modern <span class="unix">NetBSD</span> system, the administrator may wish to use one of several available MTAs.<p>
It would be difficult to modify all MUA software typically available on a system, so most of the authors of alternative MTAs have written their front end message submission programs that may appear in the place of <i class="file">/usr/sbin/sendmail</i>, but still follow the same calling conventions as &#8220;sendmail&#8221;.<p>
The &#8220;sendmail&#8221; MTA also typically has aliases named <a class="link-man" href="../1/mailq">mailq(1)</a> and <a class="link-man" href="../1/newaliases">newaliases(1)</a> linked to it. The program knows to behave differently when its <b class="var">argv[0]</b> is &#8220;mailq&#8221; or &#8220;newaliases&#8221; and behaves appropriately. Typically, replacement MTAs provide similar functionality, either through a program that also switches behavior based on calling name, or through a set of programs that provide similar functionality.<p>
Although having replacement programs that plug replace &#8220;sendmail&#8221; helps in installing alternative MTAs, it essentially makes the configuration of the system depend on hand installing new programs in <i class="file">/usr</i>. This leads to configuration problems for many administrators, since they may wish to install a new MTA without altering the system provided <i class="file">/usr</i>. (This may be, for example, to avoid having upgrade problems when a new version of the system is installed over the old.) They may also have a shared <i class="file">/usr</i> among several machines, and may wish to avoid placing implicit configuration information in a read-only <i class="file">/usr</i>.<p>
The <b class="name">mailwrapper</b> program is designed to replace <i class="file">/usr/sbin/sendmail</i> and to invoke an appropriate MTA based on configuration information placed in <i class="file">/etc/mailer.conf</i>. This permits the administrator to configure which MTA is to be invoked on the system at run time.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x46494c4553">FILES</h1> Configuration for <b class="name">mailwrapper</b> is kept in <i class="file">/etc/mailer.conf</i>. <i class="file">/usr/sbin/sendmail</i> is typically set up as a symlink to <b class="name">mailwrapper</b> which is not usually invoked on its own.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x4558495420535441545553">EXIT STATUS</h1> <b class="name">mailwrapper</b> exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x444941474e4f5354494353">DIAGNOSTICS</h1> <b class="name">mailwrapper</b> will print a diagnostic if its configuration file is missing or malformed, or does not contain a mapping for the name under which it was invoked.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1 id="x53454520414c534f">SEE ALSO</h1> <a class="link-man" href="../1/mail">mail(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/mailq">mailq(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/newaliases">newaliases(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../1/postfix">postfix(1)</a>, <a class="link-man" href="../5/mailer.conf">mailer.conf(5)</a></div>

<div class="section">
<h1 id="x42554753">BUGS</h1> The entire reason this program exists is a crock. Instead, a command for how to submit mail should be standardized, and all the &#8220;behave differently if invoked with a different name&#8221; behavior of things like <a class="link-man" href="../1/mailq">mailq(1)</a> should go away.</div>
