<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <b>dnssec&#45;keyfromlabel</b> generates a key pair of files that referencing a key object stored in a cryptographic hardware service module (HSM). The private key file can be used for DNSSEC signing of zone data as if it were a conventional signing key created by  <b>dnssec&#45;keygen</b>, but the key material is stored within the HSM, and the actual signing takes place there.<p>
The  <b>name</b> of the key is specified on the command line. This must match the name of the zone for which the key is being generated.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> &#45;a  <i>algorithm</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Selects the cryptographic algorithm. The value of  <b>algorithm</b> must be one of RSAMD5, RSASHA1, DSA, NSEC3RSASHA1, NSEC3DSA, RSASHA256, RSASHA512, ECCGOST, ECDSAP256SHA256 or ECDSAP384SHA384. These values are case insensitive.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If no algorithm is specified, then RSASHA1 will be used by default, unless the  <b>&#45;3</b> option is specified, in which case NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used instead. (If  <b>&#45;3</b> is used and an algorithm is specified, that algorithm will be checked for compatibility with NSEC3.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note 1: that for DNSSEC, RSASHA1 is a mandatory to implement algorithm, and DSA is recommended.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note 2: DH automatically sets the &#45;k flag.</div>
<p>
&#45;3<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Use an NSEC3&#45;capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC key. If this option is used and no algorithm is explicitly set on the command line, NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used by default.</div>
<p>
&#45;E <i>engine</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Specifies the cryptographic hardware to use.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When BIND is built with OpenSSL PKCS#11 support, this defaults to the string "pkcs11", which identifies an OpenSSL engine that can drive a cryptographic accelerator or hardware service module. When BIND is built with native PKCS#11 cryptography (&#45;&#45;enable&#45;native&#45;pkcs11), it defaults to the path of the PKCS#11 provider library specified via "&#45;&#45;with&#45;pkcs11".</div>
<p>
&#45;l <i>label</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Specifies the label for a key pair in the crypto hardware.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When BIND 9 is built with OpenSSL&#45;based PKCS#11 support, the label is an arbitrary string that identifies a particular key. It may be preceded by an optional OpenSSL engine name, followed by a colon, as in "pkcs11: <i>keylabel</i>".<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When BIND 9 is built with native PKCS#11 support, the label is a PKCS#11 URI string in the format "pkcs11: <b>keyword</b>=<i>value</i>[;<b>keyword</b>=<i>value</i>;...]" Keywords include "token", which identifies the HSM; "object", which identifies the key; and "pin&#45;source", which identifies a file from which the HSM's PIN code can be obtained. The label will be stored in the on&#45;disk "private" file.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the label contains a  <b>pin&#45;source</b> field, tools using the generated key files will be able to use the HSM for signing and other operations without any need for an operator to manually enter a PIN. Note: Making the HSM's PIN accessible in this manner may reduce the security advantage of using an HSM; be sure this is what you want to do before making use of this feature.</div>
<p>
&#45;n <i>nametype</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Specifies the owner type of the key. The value of  <b>nametype</b> must either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key (KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY (for a key associated with a host (KEY)), USER (for a key associated with a user(KEY)) or OTHER (DNSKEY). These values are case insensitive.</div>
<p>
&#45;C<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Compatibility mode: generates an old&#45;style key, without any metadata. By default,  <b>dnssec&#45;keyfromlabel</b> will include the key's creation date in the metadata stored with the private key, and other dates may be set there as well (publication date, activation date, etc). Keys that include this data may be incompatible with older versions of BIND; the  <b>&#45;C</b> option suppresses them.</div>
<p>
&#45;c <i>class</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Indicates that the DNS record containing the key should have the specified class. If not specified, class IN is used.</div>
<p>
&#45;f <i>flag</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Set the specified flag in the flag field of the KEY/DNSKEY record. The only recognized flags are KSK (Key Signing Key) and REVOKE.</div>
<p>
&#45;G<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Generate a key, but do not publish it or sign with it. This option is incompatible with &#45;P and &#45;A.</div>
<p>
&#45;h<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to  <b>dnssec&#45;keyfromlabel</b>.</div>
<p>
&#45;K <i>directory</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Sets the directory in which the key files are to be written.</div>
<p>
&#45;k<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Generate KEY records rather than DNSKEY records.</div>
<p>
&#45;L <i>ttl</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a DNSKEY RR. If the key is imported into a zone, this is the TTL that will be used for it, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence. Setting the default TTL to 0 or none removes it.</div>
<p>
&#45;p <i>protocol</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Sets the protocol value for the key. The protocol is a number between 0 and 255. The default is 3 (DNSSEC). Other possible values for this argument are listed in RFC 2535 and its successors.</div>
<p>
&#45;S <i>key</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Generate a key as an explicit successor to an existing key. The name, algorithm, size, and type of the key will be set to match the predecessor. The activation date of the new key will be set to the inactivation date of the existing one. The publication date will be set to the activation date minus the prepublication interval, which defaults to 30 days.</div>
<p>
&#45;t <i>type</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Indicates the use of the key.  <b>type</b> must be one of AUTHCONF, NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF. The default is AUTHCONF. AUTH refers to the ability to authenticate data, and CONF the ability to encrypt data.</div>
<p>
&#45;v <i>level</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Sets the debugging level.</div>
<p>
&#45;V<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Prints version information.</div>
<p>
&#45;y<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Allows DNSSEC key files to be generated even if the key ID would collide with that of an existing key, in the event of either key being revoked. (This is only safe to use if you are sure you won't be using RFC 5011 trust anchor maintenance with either of the keys involved.)</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>TIMING OPTIONS</h1> Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the argument begins with a '+' or '&#45;', it is interpreted as an offset from the present time. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one of the suffixes 'y', 'mo', 'w', 'd', 'h', or 'mi', then the offset is computed in years (defined as 365 24&#45;hour days, ignoring leap years), months (defined as 30 24&#45;hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds. To explicitly prevent a date from being set, use 'none' or 'never'.<p>
&#45;P <i>date/offset</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used to sign it. If not set, and if the &#45;G option has not been used, the default is "now".</div>
<p>
&#45;A <i>date/offset</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Sets the date on which the key is to be activated. After that date, the key will be included in the zone and used to sign it. If not set, and if the &#45;G option has not been used, the default is "now".</div>
<p>
&#45;R <i>date/offset</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that date, the key will be flagged as revoked. It will be included in the zone and will be used to sign it.</div>
<p>
&#45;I <i>date/offset</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that date, the key will still be included in the zone, but it will not be used to sign it.</div>
<p>
&#45;D <i>date/offset</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the key will no longer be included in the zone. (It may remain in the key repository, however.)</div>
<p>
&#45;i <i>interval</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Sets the prepublication interval for a key. If set, then the publication and activation dates must be separated by at least this much time. If the activation date is specified but the publication date isn't, then the publication date will default to this much time before the activation date; conversely, if the publication date is specified but activation date isn't, then activation will be set to this much time after publication.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the key is being created as an explicit successor to another key, then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is zero.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the suffixes 'y', 'mo', 'w', 'd', 'h', or 'mi', then the interval is measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in seconds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>GENERATED KEY FILES</h1> When  <b>dnssec&#45;keyfromlabel</b> completes successfully, it prints a string of the form  <i>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii</i> to the standard output. This is an identification string for the key files it has generated.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>nnnn</i> is the key name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>aaa</i> is the numeric representation of the algorithm.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>iiiii</i> is the key identifier (or footprint).</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>dnssec&#45;keyfromlabel</b> creates two files, with names based on the printed string.  <i>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key</i> contains the public key, and  <i>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private</i> contains the private key.<p>
The  <i>.key</i> file contains a DNS KEY record that can be inserted into a zone file (directly or with a $INCLUDE statement).<p>
The  <i>.private</i> file contains algorithm&#45;specific fields. For obvious security reasons, this file does not have general read permission.</div>
