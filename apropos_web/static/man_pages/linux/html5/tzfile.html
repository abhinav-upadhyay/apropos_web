<h1>NAME</h1> tzfile - time zone information</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;tzfile.h&gt;</b></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This page describes the structure of timezone files as commonly found in <i>/usr/lib/zoneinfo</i> or <i>/usr/share/zoneinfo</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The time zone information files used by <b>tzset</b>(3) begin with the magic characters &quot;TZif&quot; to identify then as time zone information files, followed by a character identifying the version of the file's format (as of 2005, either an ASCII NUL ('\0') or a '2') followed by fifteen bytes containing zeros reserved for future use, followed by six four-byte values of type <i>long</i>, written in a &quot;standard&quot; byte order (the high-order byte of the value is written first). These values are, in order:<dl>
<dt>
<i>tzh_ttisgmtcnt</i></dt>
<dd>
The number of UTC/local indicators stored in the file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>tzh_ttisstdcnt</i></dt>
<dd>
The number of standard/wall indicators stored in the file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>tzh_leapcnt</i></dt>
<dd>
The number of leap seconds for which data is stored in the file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>tzh_timecnt</i></dt>
<dd>
The number of &quot;transition times&quot; for which data is stored in the file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>tzh_typecnt</i></dt>
<dd>
The number of &quot;local time types&quot; for which data is stored in the file (must not be zero).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>tzh_charcnt</i></dt>
<dd>
The number of characters of &quot;timezone abbreviation strings&quot; stored in the file.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The above header is followed by <i>tzh_timecnt</i> four-byte values of type <i>long</i>, sorted in ascending order. These values are written in &quot;standard&quot; byte order. Each is used as a transition time (as returned by <b>time</b>(2)) at which the rules for computing local time change. Next come <i>tzh_timecnt</i> one-byte values of type <i>unsigned char</i>; each one tells which of the different types of &quot;local time&quot; types described in the file is associated with the same-indexed transition time. These values serve as indices into an array of <i>ttinfo</i> structures (with <i>tzh_typecnt</i> entries) that appear next in the file; these structures are defined as follows:<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
struct ttinfo {<br/>
    long         tt_gmtoff;<br/>
    int          tt_isdst;<br/>
    unsigned int tt_abbrind;<br/>
};<br/>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Each structure is written as a four-byte value for <i>tt_gmtoff</i> of type <i>long</i>, in a standard byte order, followed by a one-byte value for <i>tt_isdst</i> and a one-byte value for <i>tt_abbrind</i>. In each structure, <i>tt_gmtoff</i> gives the number of seconds to be added to UTC, <i>tt_isdst</i> tells whether <i>tm_isdst</i> should be set by <b>localtime</b>(3), and <i>tt_abbrind</i> serves as an index into the array of timezone abbreviation characters that follow the <i>ttinfo</i> structure(s) in the file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Then there are <i>tzh_leapcnt</i> pairs of four-byte values, written in standard byte order; the first value of each pair gives the time (as returned by <b>time</b>(2)) at which a leap second occurs; the second gives the <i>total</i> number of leap seconds to be applied after the given time. The pairs of values are sorted in ascending order by time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Then there are <i>tzh_ttisstdcnt</i> standard/wall indicators, each stored as a one-byte value; they tell whether the transition times associated with local time types were specified as standard time or wall clock time, and are used when a timezone file is used in handling POSIX-style timezone environment variables.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Finally, there are <i>tzh_ttisgmtcnt</i> UTC/local indicators, each stored as a one-byte value; they tell whether the transition times associated with local time types were specified as UTC or local time, and are used when a timezone file is used in handling POSIX-style timezone environment variables.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>localtime</b>(3) uses the first standard-time <i>ttinfo</i> structure in the file (or simply the first <i>ttinfo</i> structure in the absence of a standard-time structure) if either <i>tzh_timecnt</i> is zero or the time argument is less than the first transition time recorded in the file.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> This manual page documents <i>&lt;tzfile.h&gt;</i> in the glibc source archive, see <i>timezone/tzfile.h</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It seems that timezone uses <b>tzfile</b> internally, but glibc refuses to expose it to userspace.  This is most likely because the standardised functions are more useful and portable, and actually documented by glibc.  It may only be in glibc just to support the non-glibc-maintained timezone data (which is maintained by some other entity).</div>

</div>
For version-2-format timezone files, the above header and data is followed by a second header and data, identical in format except that eight bytes are used for each transition time or leap-second time. After the second header and data comes a newline-enclosed, POSIX-TZ-environment-variable-style string for use in handling instants after the last transition time stored in the file (with nothing between the newlines if there is no POSIX representation for such instants).</div>
