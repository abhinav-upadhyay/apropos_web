<h1>NAME</h1> shadow - shadowed password file</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
shadow is a file which contains the password information for the system's accounts and optional aging information.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This file must not be readable by regular users if password security is to be maintained.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each line of this file contains 9 fields, separated by colons (&#8220;:&#8221;), in the following order:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>login name</b><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
It must be a valid account name, which exist on the system.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>encrypted password</b><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Refer to  <b>crypt</b>(3) for details on how this string is interpreted.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the password field contains some string that is not a valid result of  <b>crypt</b>(3), for instance ! or *, the user will not be able to use a unix password to log in (but the user may log in the system by other means).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This field may be empty, in which case no passwords are required to authenticate as the specified login name. However, some applications which read the /etc/shadow file may decide not to permit any access at all if the password field is empty.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A password field which starts with a exclamation mark means that the password is locked. The remaining characters on the line represent the password field before the password was locked.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>date of last password change</b><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
The date of the last password change, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The value 0 has a special meaning, which is that the user should change her pasword the next time she will log in the system.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An empty field means that password aging features are disabled.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>minimum password age</b><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
The minimum password age is the number of days the user will have to wait before she will be allowed to change her password again.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An empty field and value 0 mean that there are no minimum password age.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>maximum password age</b><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
The maximum password age is the number of days after which the user will have to change her password.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
After this number of days is elapsed, the password may still be valid. The user should be asked to change her password the next time she will log in.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An empty field means that there are no maximum password age, no password warning period, and no password inactivity period (see below).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the maximum password age is lower than the minimum password age, the user cannot change her password.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>password warning period</b><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
The number of days before a password is going to expire (see the maximum password age above) during which the user should be warned.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An empty field and value 0 mean that there are no password warning period.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>password inactivity period</b><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
The number of days after a password has expired (see the maximum password age above) during which the password should still be accepted (and the user should update her password during the next login).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
After expiration of the password and this expiration period is elapsed, no login is possible using the current user's password. The user should contact her administrator.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An empty field means that there are no enforcement of an inactivity period.</div>
<div class="spacer">

<b>account expiration date</b><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
The date of expiration of the account, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that an account expiration differs from a password expiration. In case of an acount expiration, the user shall not be allowed to login. In case of a password expiration, the user is not allowed to login using her password.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An empty field means that the account will never expire.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The value 0 should not be used as it is interpreted as either an account with no expiration, or as an expiration on Jan 1, 1970.</div>
