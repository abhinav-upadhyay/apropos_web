<h1>NAME</h1> uuencode - format of an encoded uuencode file</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> Files output by uuencode(1) consist of a header line, followed by a number of body lines, and a trailer line. The uudecode(1) command will ignore any lines preceding the header or following the trailer. Lines preceding a header must not, of course, look like a header.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The header line is distinguished by having the first 6 characters <i>begin&#160;</i> The word <i>begin</i> is followed by a mode (in octal), and a string which names the remote file. A space separates the three items in the header line.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The body consists of a number of lines, each at most 62 characters long (including the trailing newline). These consist of a character count, followed by encoded characters, followed by a newline. The character count is a single printing character, and represents an integer, the number of bytes the rest of the line represents. Such integers are always in the range from 0 to 63 and can be determined by subtracting the character space (octal 40) from the character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Groups of 3 bytes are stored in 4 characters, 6 bits per character. All are offset by a space to make the characters printing. The last line may be shorter than the normal 45 bytes. If the size is not a multiple of 3, this fact can be determined by the value of the count on the last line. Extra garbage will be included to make the character count a multiple of 4. The body is terminated by a line with a count of zero. This line consists of one ASCII space.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The trailer line consists of <i>end</i> on a line by itself.</div>
