<h1>NAME</h1> ptmx, pts - pseudoterminal master and slave</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The file  <i>/dev/ptmx</i> is a character file with major number 5 and minor number 2, usually of mode 0666 and owner.group of root.root. It is used to create a pseudoterminal master and slave pair.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a process opens <i>/dev/ptmx</i>, it gets a file descriptor for a pseudoterminal master (PTM), and a pseudoterminal slave (PTS) device is created in the <i>/dev/pts</i> directory. Each file descriptor obtained by opening  <i>/dev/ptmx</i> is an independent PTM with its own associated PTS, whose path can be found by passing the descriptor to <b>ptsname</b>(3).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Before opening the pseudoterminal slave, you must pass the master's file descriptor to <b>grantpt</b>(3) and <b>unlockpt</b>(3).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Once both the pseudoterminal master and slave are open, the slave provides processes with an interface that is identical to that of a real terminal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Data written to the slave is presented on the master descriptor as input. Data written to the master is presented to the slave as input.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In practice, pseudoterminals are used for implementing terminal emulators such as <b>xterm</b>(1), in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is interpreted by the application in the same way a real terminal would interpret the data, and for implementing remote-login programs such as <b>sshd</b>(8), in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is sent across the network to a client program that is connected to a terminal or terminal emulator.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Psuedoterminals can also be used to send input to programs that normally refuse to read input from pipes (such as <b>su</b>(1), and <b>passwd</b>(1)).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FILES</h1> <i>/dev/ptmx</i>, <i>/dev/pts/*</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> The Linux support for the above (known as UNIX 98 pseudoterminal naming) is done using the <i>devpts</i> file system, that should be mounted on <i>/dev/pts</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Before this UNIX 98 scheme, master pseudoterminals were called <i>/dev/ptyp0</i>, ... and slave pseudoterminals <i>/dev/ttyp0</i>, ... and one needed lots of preallocated device nodes.</div>
