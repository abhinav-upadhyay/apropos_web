<h1>NAME</h1> write - write to a file descriptor</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>ssize_t write(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, const void *</b><i>buf</i><b>, size_t </b><i>count</i><b>);</b></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <b>write</b>() writes up to <i>count</i> bytes from the buffer pointed <i>buf</i> to the file referred to by the file descriptor <i>fd</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The number of bytes written may be less than <i>count</i> if, for example, there is insufficient space on the underlying physical medium, or the <b>RLIMIT_FSIZE</b> resource limit is encountered (see <b>setrlimit</b>(2)), or the call was interrupted by a signal handler after having written less than <i>count</i> bytes. (See also <b>pipe</b>(7).)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For a seekable file (i.e., one to which <b>lseek</b>(2) may be applied, for example, a regular file) writing takes place at the current file offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes actually written. If the file was <b>open</b>(2)ed with <b>O_APPEND</b>, the file offset is first set to the end of the file before writing. The adjustment of the file offset and the write operation are performed as an atomic step.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
POSIX requires that a <b>read</b>(2) which can be proved to occur after a <b>write</b>() has returned returns the new data. Note that not all file systems are POSIX conforming.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> On success, the number of bytes written is returned (zero indicates nothing was written). On error, -1 is returned, and  <i>errno</i> is set appropriately.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If <i>count</i> is zero and <i>fd</i> refers to a regular file, then <b>write</b>() may return a failure status if one of the errors below is detected. If no errors are detected, 0 will be returned without causing any other effect. If  <i>count</i> is zero and <i>fd</i> refers to a file other than a regular file, the results are not specified.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b></dt>
<dd>
The file descriptor <i>fd</i> refers to a file other than a socket and has been marked nonblocking (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), and the write would block.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b></dt>
<dd>
The file descriptor <i>fd</i> refers to a socket and has been marked nonblocking (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), and the write would block. POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be returned for this case, and does not require these constants to have the same value, so a portable application should check for both possibilities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EBADF</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>fd</i> is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for writing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EDESTADDRREQ</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>fd</i> refers to a datagram socket for which a peer address has not been set using <b>connect</b>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EFAULT</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>buf</i> is outside your accessible address space.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EFBIG</b></dt>
<dd>
An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the implementation-defined maximum file size or the process's file size limit, or to write at a position past the maximum allowed offset.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINTR</b></dt>
<dd>
The call was interrupted by a signal before any data was written; see <b>signal</b>(7).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>fd</i> is attached to an object which is unsuitable for writing; or the file was opened with the <b>O_DIRECT</b> flag, and either the address specified in <i>buf</i>, the value specified in <i>count</i>, or the current file offset is not suitably aligned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EIO</b></dt>
<dd>
A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>ENOSPC</b></dt>
<dd>
The device containing the file referred to by <i>fd</i> has no room for the data.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EPIPE</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>fd</i> is connected to a pipe or socket whose reading end is closed. When this happens the writing process will also receive a <b>SIGPIPE</b> signal. (Thus, the write return value is seen only if the program catches, blocks or ignores this signal.)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Other errors may occur, depending on the object connected to <i>fd</i>.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Under SVr4 a write may be interrupted and return <b>EINTR</b> at any point, not just before any data is written.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> A successful return from <b>write</b>() does not make any guarantee that data has been committed to disk. In fact, on some buggy implementations, it does not even guarantee that space has successfully been reserved for the data. The only way to be sure is to call <b>fsync</b>(2) after you are done writing all your data.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If a <b>write</b>() is interrupted by a signal handler before any bytes are written, then the call fails with the error <b>EINTR</b>; if it is interrupted after at least one byte has been written, the call succeeds, and returns the number of bytes written.</div>
