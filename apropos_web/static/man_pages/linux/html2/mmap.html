<h1>NAME</h1> mmap, munmap - map or unmap files or devices into memory</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<b>void *mmap(void *</b><i>addr</i><b>, size_t </b><i>length</i><b>, int </b><i>prot</i><b>, int </b><i>flags</i><b>,</b><br/>
<b>           int </b><i>fd</i><b>, off_t </b><i>offset</i><b>);</b><br/>
<b>int munmap(void *</b><i>addr</i><b>, size_t </b><i>length</i><b>);</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <b>mmap</b>() creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the calling process. The starting address for the new mapping is specified in <i>addr</i>. The <i>length</i> argument specifies the length of the mapping.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If <i>addr</i> is NULL, then the kernel chooses the address at which to create the mapping; this is the most portable method of creating a new mapping. If <i>addr</i> is not NULL, then the kernel takes it as a hint about where to place the mapping; on Linux, the mapping will be created at a nearby page boundary. The address of the new mapping is returned as the result of the call.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The contents of a file mapping (as opposed to an anonymous mapping; see <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> below), are initialized using <i>length</i> bytes starting at offset <i>offset</i> in the file (or other object) referred to by the file descriptor <i>fd</i>. <i>offset</i> must be a multiple of the page size as returned by <i>sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE)</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>prot</i> argument describes the desired memory protection of the mapping (and must not conflict with the open mode of the file). It is either <b>PROT_NONE</b> or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flags:<dl>
<dt>
<b>PROT_EXEC</b></dt>
<dd>
Pages may be executed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PROT_READ</b></dt>
<dd>
Pages may be read.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PROT_WRITE</b></dt>
<dd>
Pages may be written.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PROT_NONE</b></dt>
<dd>
Pages may not be accessed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>flags</i> argument determines whether updates to the mapping are visible to other processes mapping the same region, and whether updates are carried through to the underlying file. This behavior is determined by including exactly one of the following values in <i>flags</i>:<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_SHARED</b></dt>
<dd>
Share this mapping. Updates to the mapping are visible to other processes that map this file, and are carried through to the underlying file. The file may not actually be updated until <b>msync</b>(2) or <b>munmap</b>() is called.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_PRIVATE</b></dt>
<dd>
Create a private copy-on-write mapping. Updates to the mapping are not visible to other processes mapping the same file, and are not carried through to the underlying file. It is unspecified whether changes made to the file after the <b>mmap</b>() call are visible in the mapped region.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Both of these flags are described in POSIX.1-2001.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In addition, zero or more of the following values can be ORed in <i>flags</i>:<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_32BIT</b> (since Linux 2.4.20, 2.6)</dt>
<dd>
Put the mapping into the first 2 Gigabytes of the process address space. This flag is only supported on x86-64, for 64-bit programs. It was added to allow thread stacks to be allocated somewhere in the first 2GB of memory, so as to improve context-switch performance on some early 64-bit processors. Modern x86-64 processors no longer have this performance problem, so use of this flag is not required on those systems. The <b>MAP_32BIT</b> flag is ignored when <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_ANON</b></dt>
<dd>
Synonym for <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b>. Deprecated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b></dt>
<dd>
The mapping is not backed by any file; its contents are initialized to zero. The <i>fd</i> and <i>offset</i> arguments are ignored; however, some implementations require <i>fd</i> to be -1 if <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> (or <b>MAP_ANON</b>) is specified, and portable applications should ensure this. The use of <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> in conjunction with <b>MAP_SHARED</b> is only supported on Linux since kernel 2.4.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_DENYWRITE</b></dt>
<dd>
This flag is ignored. (Long ago, it signaled that attempts to write to the underlying file should fail with <b>ETXTBUSY</b>. But this was a source of denial-of-service attacks.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_EXECUTABLE</b></dt>
<dd>
This flag is ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_FILE</b></dt>
<dd>
Compatibility flag. Ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_FIXED</b></dt>
<dd>
Don't interpret <i>addr</i> as a hint: place the mapping at exactly that address. <i>addr</i> must be a multiple of the page size. If the memory region specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>len</i> overlaps pages of any existing mapping(s), then the overlapped part of the existing mapping(s) will be discarded. If the specified address cannot be used, <b>mmap</b>() will fail. Because requiring a fixed address for a mapping is less portable, the use of this option is discouraged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_GROWSDOWN</b></dt>
<dd>
Used for stacks. Indicates to the kernel virtual memory system that the mapping should extend downward in memory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_HUGETLB</b> (since Linux 2.6.32)</dt>
<dd>
Allocate the mapping using &quot;huge pages.&quot; See the kernel source file <i>Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt</i> for further information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_LOCKED</b> (since Linux 2.5.37)</dt>
<dd>
Lock the pages of the mapped region into memory in the manner of <b>mlock</b>(2). This flag is ignored in older kernels.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b> (since Linux 2.5.46)</dt>
<dd>
Only meaningful in conjunction with <b>MAP_POPULATE</b>. Don't perform read-ahead: only create page tables entries for pages that are already present in RAM. Since Linux 2.6.23, this flag causes <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> to do nothing. One day the combination of <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> and <b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b> may be reimplemented.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_NORESERVE</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not reserve swap space for this mapping. When swap space is reserved, one has the guarantee that it is possible to modify the mapping. When swap space is not reserved one might get <b>SIGSEGV</b> upon a write if no physical memory is available. See also the discussion of the file <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i> in <b>proc</b>(5). In kernels before 2.6, this flag only had effect for private writable mappings.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_POPULATE</b> (since Linux 2.5.46)</dt>
<dd>
Populate (prefault) page tables for a mapping. For a file mapping, this causes read-ahead on the file. Later accesses to the mapping will not be blocked by page faults. <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> is only supported for private mappings since Linux 2.6.23.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_STACK</b> (since Linux 2.6.27)</dt>
<dd>
Allocate the mapping at an address suitable for a process or thread stack. This flag is currently a no-op, but is used in the glibc threading implementation so that if some architectures require special treatment for stack allocations, support can later be transparently implemented for glibc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MAP_UNINITIALIZED</b> (since Linux 2.6.33)</dt>
<dd>
Don't clear anonymous pages. This flag is intended to improve performance on embedded devices. This flag is only honored if the kernel was configured with the <b>CONFIG_MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED</b> option. Because of the security implications, that option is normally enabled only on embedded devices (i.e., devices where one has complete control of the contents of user memory).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Of the above flags, only <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is specified in POSIX.1-2001. However, most systems also support <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> (or its synonym <b>MAP_ANON</b>).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some systems document the additional flags <b>MAP_AUTOGROW</b>, <b>MAP_AUTORESRV</b>, <b>MAP_COPY</b>, and <b>MAP_LOCAL</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Memory mapped by <b>mmap</b>() is preserved across <b>fork</b>(2), with the same attributes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A file is mapped in multiples of the page size. For a file that is not a multiple of the page size, the remaining memory is zeroed when mapped, and writes to that region are not written out to the file. The effect of changing the size of the underlying file of a mapping on the pages that correspond to added or removed regions of the file is unspecified.<div class="subsection">
<h2>munmap()</h2> The <b>munmap</b>() system call deletes the mappings for the specified address range, and causes further references to addresses within the range to generate invalid memory references. The region is also automatically unmapped when the process is terminated. On the other hand, closing the file descriptor does not unmap the region.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The address <i>addr</i> must be a multiple of the page size. All pages containing a part of the indicated range are unmapped, and subsequent references to these pages will generate <b>SIGSEGV</b>. It is not an error if the indicated range does not contain any mapped pages.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Timestamps changes for file-backed mappings</h2> For file-backed mappings, the <i>st_atime</i> field for the mapped file may be updated at any time between the <b>mmap</b>() and the corresponding unmapping; the first reference to a mapped page will update the field if it has not been already.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>st_ctime</i> and <i>st_mtime</i> field for a file mapped with <b>PROT_WRITE</b> and <b>MAP_SHARED</b> will be updated after a write to the mapped region, and before a subsequent <b>msync</b>(2) with the <b>MS_SYNC</b> or <b>MS_ASYNC</b> flag, if one occurs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> On success, <b>mmap</b>() returns a pointer to the mapped area. On error, the value <b>MAP_FAILED</b> (that is, <i>(void&#160;*)&#160;-1</i>) is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set appropriately. On success, <b>munmap</b>() returns 0, on failure -1, and <i>errno</i> is set (probably to <b>EINVAL</b>).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1><dl>

<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> SVr4, 4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>AVAILABILITY</h1> On POSIX systems on which <b>mmap</b>(), <b>msync</b>(2) and <b>munmap</b>() are available, <b>_POSIX_MAPPED_FILES</b> is defined in  <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i> to a value greater than 0. (See also <b>sysconf</b>(3).)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> Since kernel 2.4, this system call has been superseded by <b>mmap2</b>(2). Nowadays, the glibc <b>mmap</b>() wrapper function invokes <b>mmap2</b>(2) with a suitably adjusted value for <i>offset</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On some hardware architectures (e.g., i386), <b>PROT_WRITE</b> implies <b>PROT_READ</b>. It is architecture dependent whether <b>PROT_READ</b> implies <b>PROT_EXEC</b> or not. Portable programs should always set <b>PROT_EXEC</b> if they intend to execute code in the new mapping.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The portable way to create a mapping is to specify <i>addr</i> as 0 (NULL), and omit <b>MAP_FIXED</b> from <i>flags</i>. In this case, the system chooses the address for the mapping; the address is chosen so as not to conflict with any existing mapping, and will not be 0. If the <b>MAP_FIXED</b> flag is specified, and <i>addr</i> is 0 (NULL), then the mapped address will be 0 (NULL).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS</h1> On Linux there are no guarantees like those suggested above under <b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>. By default, any process can be killed at any moment when the system runs out of memory.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In kernels before 2.6.7, the <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> flag only has effect if <i>prot</i> is specified as <b>PROT_NONE</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
SUSv3 specifies that <b>mmap</b>() should fail if <i>length</i> is 0. However, in kernels before 2.6.12, <b>mmap</b>() succeeded in this case: no mapping was created and the call returned <i>addr</i>. Since kernel 2.6.12, <b>mmap</b>() fails with the error <b>EINVAL</b> for this case.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLE</h1> The following program prints part of the file specified in its first command-line argument to standard output. The range of bytes to be printed is specified via offset and length values in the second and third command-line arguments. The program creates a memory mapping of the required pages of the file and then uses <b>write</b>(2) to output the desired bytes.<div class="spacer">
