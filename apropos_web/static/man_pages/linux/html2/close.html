<h1>NAME</h1> close - close a file descriptor</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<b>int close(int </b><i>fd</i><b>);</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <b>close</b>() closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any file and may be reused. Any record locks (see <b>fcntl</b>(2)) held on the file it was associated with, and owned by the process, are removed (regardless of the file descriptor that was used to obtain the lock).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>fd</i> is the last file descriptor referring to the underlying open file description (see <b>open</b>(2)), the resources associated with the open file description are freed; if the descriptor was the last reference to a file which has been removed using <b>unlink</b>(2) the file is deleted.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> <b>close</b>() returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set appropriately.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>EBADF</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>fd</i> isn't a valid open file descriptor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINTR</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>close</b>() call was interrupted by a signal; see <b>signal</b>(7).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EIO</b></dt>
<dd>
An I/O error occurred.</dd>
</dl>

<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> Not checking the return value of <b>close</b>() is a common but nevertheless serious programming error. It is quite possible that errors on a previous <b>write</b>(2) operation are first reported at the final <b>close</b>(). Not checking the return value when closing the file may lead to silent loss of data. This can especially be observed with NFS and with disk quota.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A successful close does not guarantee that the data has been successfully saved to disk, as the kernel defers writes. It is not common for a file system to flush the buffers when the stream is closed. If you need to be sure that the data is physically stored use <b>fsync</b>(2). (It will depend on the disk hardware at this point.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is probably unwise to close file descriptors while they may be in use by system calls in other threads in the same process. Since a file descriptor may be reused, there are some obscure race conditions that may cause unintended side effects.</div>
