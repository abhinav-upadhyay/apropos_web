<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Standard Description</h2> (From POSIX.1) The <b>vfork</b>() function has the same effect as <b>fork</b>(2), except that the behavior is undefined if the process created by <b>vfork</b>() either modifies any data other than a variable of type <i>pid_t</i> used to store the return value from <b>vfork</b>(), or returns from the function in which <b>vfork</b>() was called, or calls any other function before successfully calling <b>_exit</b>(2) or one of the <b>exec</b>(3) family of functions.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Linux Description</h2> <b>vfork</b>(), just like <b>fork</b>(2), creates a child process of the calling process. For details and return value and errors, see <b>fork</b>(2).<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>vfork</b>() is a special case of <b>clone</b>(2). It is used to create new processes without copying the page tables of the parent process. It may be useful in performance-sensitive applications where a child is created which then immediately issues an <b>execve</b>(2).<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>vfork</b>() differs from <b>fork</b>(2) in that the parent is suspended until the child terminates (either normally, by calling <b>_exit</b>(2), or abnormally, after delivery of a fatal signal), or it makes a call to <b>execve</b>(2). Until that point, the child shares all memory with its parent, including the stack. The child must not return from the current function or call <b>exit</b>(3), but may call <b>_exit</b>(2).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Signal handlers are inherited, but not shared. Signals to the parent arrive after the child releases the parent's memory (i.e., after the child terminates or calls <b>execve</b>(2)).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Historic Description</h2> Under Linux, <b>fork</b>(2) is implemented using copy-on-write pages, so the only penalty incurred by <b>fork</b>(2) is the time and memory required to duplicate the parent's page tables, and to create a unique task structure for the child. However, in the bad old days a <b>fork</b>(2) would require making a complete copy of the caller's data space, often needlessly, since usually immediately afterward an <b>exec</b>(3) is done. Thus, for greater efficiency, BSD introduced the <b>vfork</b>() system call, which did not fully copy the address space of the parent process, but borrowed the parent's memory and thread of control until a call to <b>execve</b>(2) or an exit occurred. The parent process was suspended while the child was using its resources. The use of <b>vfork</b>() was tricky: for example, not modifying data in the parent process depended on knowing which variables were held in a register.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001. POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of <b>vfork</b>(). The requirements put on <b>vfork</b>() by the standards are weaker than those put on <b>fork</b>(2), so an implementation where the two are synonymous is compliant. In particular, the programmer cannot rely on the parent remaining blocked until the child either terminates or calls <b>execve</b>(2), and cannot rely on any specific behavior with respect to shared memory.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Linux Notes</h2> Fork handlers established using <b>pthread_atfork</b>(3) are not called when a multithreaded program employing the NPTL threading library calls <b>vfork</b>(). Fork handlers are called in this case in a program using the LinuxThreads threading library. (See <b>pthreads</b>(7) for a description of Linux threading libraries.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>History</h2> The <b>vfork</b>() system call appeared in 3.0BSD. In 4.4BSD it was made synonymous to <b>fork</b>(2) but NetBSD introduced it again, cf. http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/vfork.html . In Linux, it has been equivalent to <b>fork</b>(2) until 2.2.0-pre6 or so. Since 2.2.0-pre9 (on i386, somewhat later on other architectures) it is an independent system call. Support was added in glibc 2.0.112.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS</h1> It is rather unfortunate that Linux revived this specter from the past. The BSD man page states: &quot;This system call will be eliminated when proper system sharing mechanisms are implemented. Users should not depend on the memory sharing semantics of <b>vfork</b>() as it will, in that case, be made synonymous to <b>fork</b>(2).&quot;<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Details of the signal handling are obscure and differ between systems. The BSD man page states: &quot;To avoid a possible deadlock situation, processes that are children in the middle of a <b>vfork</b>() are never sent <b>SIGTTOU</b> or <b>SIGTTIN</b> signals; rather, output or <i>ioctl</i>s are allowed and input attempts result in an end-of-file indication.&quot;</div>
