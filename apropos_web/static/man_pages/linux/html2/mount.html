<h1>NAME</h1> mount - mount file system</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;sys/mount.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<b>int mount(const char *</b><i>source</i><b>, const char *</b><i>target</i><b>,</b><br/>
<b>          const char *</b><i>filesystemtype</i><b>, unsigned long </b><i>mountflags</i><b>,</b><br/>
<b>          const void *</b><i>data</i><b>);</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <b>mount</b>() attaches the file system specified by <i>source</i> (which is often a device name, but can also be a directory name or a dummy) to the directory specified by <i>target</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Appropriate privilege (Linux: the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability) is required to mount file systems.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Since Linux 2.4 a single file system can be visible at multiple mount points, and multiple mounts can be stacked on the same mount point.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Values for the <i>filesystemtype</i> argument supported by the kernel are listed in <i>/proc/filesystems</i> (like &quot;minix&quot;, &quot;ext2&quot;, &quot;ext3&quot;, &quot;jfs&quot;, &quot;xfs&quot;, &quot;reiserfs&quot;, &quot;msdos&quot;, &quot;proc&quot;, &quot;nfs&quot;, &quot;iso9660&quot; etc.). Further types may become available when the appropriate modules are loaded.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <i>mountflags</i> argument may have the magic number 0xC0ED ( <b>MS_MGC_VAL</b>) in the top 16 bits (this was required in kernel versions prior to 2.4, but is no longer required and ignored if specified), and various mount flags (as defined in  <i>&lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</i> for libc4 and libc5 and in  <i>&lt;sys/mount.h&gt;</i> for glibc2) in the low order 16 bits:<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_BIND</b> (Linux 2.4 onward)</dt>
<dd>
Perform a bind mount, making a file or a directory subtree visible at another point within a file system. Bind mounts may cross file system boundaries and span <b>chroot</b>(2) jails. The <i>filesystemtype</i> and <i>data</i> arguments are ignored. Up until Linux 2.6.26, <i>mountflags</i> was also ignored (the bind mount has the same mount options as the underlying mount point). Since Linux 2.6.26, the <b>MS_RDONLY</b> flag is honored when making a bind mount.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_DIRSYNC</b> (since Linux 2.5.19)</dt>
<dd>
Make directory changes on this file system synchronous. (This property can be obtained for individual directories or subtrees using <b>chattr</b>(1).)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_MANDLOCK</b></dt>
<dd>
Permit mandatory locking on files in this file system. (Mandatory locking must still be enabled on a per-file basis, as described in <b>fcntl</b>(2).)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_MOVE</b></dt>
<dd>
Move a subtree. <i>source</i> specifies an existing mount point and <i>target</i> specifies the new location. The move is atomic: at no point is the subtree unmounted. The <i>filesystemtype</i>, <i>mountflags</i>, and <i>data</i> arguments are ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_NOATIME</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not update access times for (all types of) files on this file system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_NODEV</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not allow access to devices (special files) on this file system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_NODIRATIME</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not update access times for directories on this file system. This flag provides a subset of the functionality provided by <b>MS_NOATIME</b>; that is, <b>MS_NOATIME</b> implies <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_NOEXEC</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not allow programs to be executed from this file system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_NOSUID</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits when executing programs from this file system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_RDONLY</b></dt>
<dd>
Mount file system read-only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_RELATIME</b> (Since Linux 2.6.20)</dt>
<dd>
When a file on this file system is accessed, only update the file's last access time (atime) if the current value of atime is less than or equal to the file's last modification time (mtime) or last status change time (ctime). This option is useful for programs, such as <b>mutt</b>(1), that need to know when a file has been read since it was last modified. Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior provided by this flag (unless <b>MS_NOATIME</b> was specified), and the <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> flag is required to obtain traditional semantics. In addition, since Linux 2.6.30, the file's last access time is always updated if it is more than 1 day old.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_REMOUNT</b></dt>
<dd>
Remount an existing mount. This allows you to change the <i>mountflags</i> and <i>data</i> of an existing mount without having to unmount and remount the file system. <i>source</i> and <i>target</i> should be the same values specified in the initial <b>mount</b>() call; <i>filesystemtype</i> is ignored.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The following <i>mountflags</i> can be changed: <b>MS_RDONLY</b>, <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>, <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>; before kernel 2.6.16, the following could also be changed: <b>MS_NOATIME</b> and <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>; and, additionally, before kernel 2.4.10, the following could also be changed: <b>MS_NOSUID</b>, <b>MS_NODEV</b>, <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_SILENT</b> (since Linux 2.6.17)</dt>
<dd>
Suppress the display of certain (<i>printk</i>()) warning messages in the kernel log. This flag supersedes the misnamed and obsolete <b>MS_VERBOSE</b> flag (available since Linux 2.4.12), which has the same meaning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> (Since Linux 2.6.30)</dt>
<dd>
Always update the last access time (atime) when files on this file system are accessed. (This was the default behavior before Linux 2.6.30.) Specifying this flag overrides the effect of setting the <b>MS_NOATIME</b> and <b>MS_RELATIME</b> flags.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b></dt>
<dd>
Make writes on this file system synchronous (as though the <b>O_SYNC</b> flag to <b>open</b>(2) was specified for all file opens to this file system).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
From Linux 2.4 onward, the <b>MS_NODEV</b>, <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>, and <b>MS_NOSUID</b> flags are settable on a per-mount-point basis. From kernel 2.6.16 onward, <b>MS_NOATIME</b> and <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b> are also settable on a per-mount-point basis. The <b>MS_RELATIME</b> flag is also settable on a per-mount-point basis.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>data</i> argument is interpreted by the different file systems. Typically it is a string of comma-separated options understood by this file system. See <b>mount</b>(8) for details of the options available for each filesystem type.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set appropriately.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The error values given below result from filesystem type independent errors. Each file-system type may have its own special errors and its own special behavior. See the kernel source code for details.<dl>

<h1>VERSIONS</h1> The definitions of <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b>, <b>MS_MOVE</b>, <b>MS_REC</b>, <b>MS_RELATIME</b>, and <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> were only added to glibc headers in version 2.12.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> This function is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> The original <b>MS_SYNC</b> flag was renamed <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b> in 1.1.69 when a different <b>MS_SYNC</b> was added to  <i>&lt;mman.h&gt;</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Before Linux 2.4 an attempt to execute a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program on a file system mounted with <b>MS_NOSUID</b> would fail with <b>EPERM</b>. Since Linux 2.4 the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are just silently ignored in this case.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Per-process Namespaces</h2> Starting with kernel 2.4.19, Linux provides per-process mount namespaces. A mount namespace is the set of file system mounts that are visible to a process. Mount-point namespaces can be (and usually are) shared between multiple processes, and changes to the namespace (i.e., mounts and unmounts) by one process are visible to all other processes sharing the same namespace. (The pre-2.4.19 Linux situation can be considered as one in which a single namespace was shared by every process on the system.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A child process created by <b>fork</b>(2) shares its parent's mount namespace; the mount namespace is preserved across an <b>execve</b>(2).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A process can obtain a private mount namespace if: it was created using the <b>clone</b>(2) <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> flag, in which case its new namespace is initialized to be a <i>copy</i> of the namespace of the process that called <b>clone</b>(2); or it calls <b>unshare</b>(2) with the <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> flag, which causes the caller's mount namespace to obtain a private copy of the namespace that it was previously sharing with other processes, so that future mounts and unmounts by the caller are invisible to other processes (except child processes that the caller subsequently creates) and vice versa.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The Linux-specific <i>/proc/PID/mounts</i> file exposes the list of mount points in the mount namespace of the process with the specified ID; see <b>proc</b>(5) for details.</div>
