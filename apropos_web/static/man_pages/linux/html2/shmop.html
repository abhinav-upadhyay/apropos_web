<h1>NAME</h1> shmat, shmdt - shared memory operations</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;</b> <b>#include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>void *shmat(int </b><i>shmid</i><b>, const void *</b><i>shmaddr</i><b>, int </b><i>shmflg</i><b>);</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>int shmdt(const void *</b><i>shmaddr</i><b>);</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <b>shmat</b>() attaches the shared memory segment identified by <i>shmid</i> to the address space of the calling process. The attaching address is specified by <i>shmaddr</i> with one of the following criteria:<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>shmaddr</i> is NULL, the system chooses a suitable (unused) address at which to attach the segment.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>shmaddr</i> isn't NULL and <b>SHM_RND</b> is specified in <i>shmflg</i>, the attach occurs at the address equal to <i>shmaddr</i> rounded down to the nearest multiple of <b>SHMLBA</b>. Otherwise <i>shmaddr</i> must be a page-aligned address at which the attach occurs.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <b>SHM_RDONLY</b> is specified in <i>shmflg</i>, the segment is attached for reading and the process must have read permission for the segment. Otherwise the segment is attached for read and write and the process must have read and write permission for the segment. There is no notion of a write-only shared memory segment.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The (Linux-specific) <b>SHM_REMAP</b> flag may be specified in <i>shmflg</i> to indicate that the mapping of the segment should replace any existing mapping in the range starting at <i>shmaddr</i> and continuing for the size of the segment. (Normally an <b>EINVAL</b> error would result if a mapping already exists in this address range.) In this case, <i>shmaddr</i> must not be NULL.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>brk</b>(2) value of the calling process is not altered by the attach. The segment will automatically be detached at process exit. The same segment may be attached as a read and as a read-write one, and more than once, in the process's address space.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A successful <b>shmat</b>() call updates the members of the <i>shmid_ds</i> structure (see <b>shmctl</b>(2)) associated with the shared memory segment as follows:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<i>shm_atime</i> is set to the current time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<i>shm_lpid</i> is set to the process-ID of the calling process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<i>shm_nattch</i> is incremented by one.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>shmdt</b>() detaches the shared memory segment located at the address specified by <i>shmaddr</i> from the address space of the calling process. The to-be-detached segment must be currently attached with <i>shmaddr</i> equal to the value returned by the attaching <b>shmat</b>() call.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On a successful <b>shmdt</b>() call the system updates the members of the <i>shmid_ds</i> structure associated with the shared memory segment as follows:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<i>shm_dtime</i> is set to the current time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<i>shm_lpid</i> is set to the process-ID of the calling process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<i>shm_nattch</i> is decremented by one. If it becomes 0 and the segment is marked for deletion, the segment is deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
After a <b>fork</b>(2) the child inherits the attached shared memory segments.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
After an <b>execve</b>(2) all attached shared memory segments are detached from the process.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Upon <b>_exit</b>(2) all attached shared memory segments are detached from the process.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> On success <b>shmat</b>() returns the address of the attached shared memory segment; on error <i>(void&#160;*)&#160;-1</i> is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set to indicate the cause of the error.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On success <b>shmdt</b>() returns 0; on error -1 is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set to indicate the cause of the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> When <b>shmat</b>() fails, <i>errno</i> is set to one of the following:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EACCES</b></dt>
<dd>
The calling process does not have the required permissions for the requested attach type, and does not have the <b>CAP_IPC_OWNER</b> capability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
Invalid <i>shmid</i> value, unaligned (i.e., not page-aligned and  <b>SHM_RND</b> was not specified) or invalid <i>shmaddr</i> value, or can't attach segment at <i>shmaddr</i>, or <b>SHM_REMAP</b> was specified and <i>shmaddr</i> was NULL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>ENOMEM</b></dt>
<dd>
Could not allocate memory for the descriptor or for the page tables.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <b>shmdt</b>() fails, <i>errno</i> is set as follows:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
There is no shared memory segment attached at <i>shmaddr</i>; or, <i>shmaddr</i> is not aligned on a page boundary.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In SVID 3 (or perhaps earlier) the type of the  <i>shmaddr</i> argument was changed from <i>char *</i> into <i>const void *</i>, and the returned type of <b>shmat</b>() from <i>char *</i> into <i>void *</i>. (Linux libc4 and libc5 have the <i>char *</i> prototypes; glibc2 has <i>void *</i>.)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> Using <b>shmat</b>() with <i>shmaddr</i> equal to NULL is the preferred, portable way of attaching a shared memory segment. Be aware that the shared memory segment attached in this way may be attached at different addresses in different processes. Therefore, any pointers maintained within the shared memory must be made relative (typically to the starting address of the segment), rather than absolute.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On Linux, it is possible to attach a shared memory segment even if it is already marked to be deleted. However, POSIX.1-2001 does not specify this behavior and many other implementations do not support it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following system parameter affects <b>shmat</b>():<dl>
<dt>
<b>SHMLBA</b></dt>
<dd>
Segment low boundary address multiple. Must be page aligned. For the current implementation the <b>SHMLBA</b> value is <b>PAGE_SIZE</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The implementation places no intrinsic limit on the per-process maximum number of shared memory segments (<b>SHMSEG</b>).</div>
