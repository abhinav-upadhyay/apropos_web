<h1>NAME</h1> kill - send signal to a process</div>

<b>kill</b>(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE&#160;&gt;=&#160;1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The <b>kill</b>() system call can be used to send any signal to any process group or process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>pid</i> is positive, then signal <i>sig</i> is sent to the process with the ID specified by  <i>pid</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>pid</i> equals 0, then <i>sig</i> is sent to every process in the process group of the calling process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>pid</i> equals -1, then <i>sig</i> is sent to every process for which the calling process has permission to send signals, except for process 1 ( <i>init</i>), but see below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>pid</i> is less than -1, then <i>sig</i> is sent to every process in the process group whose ID is  <i>-pid</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>sig</i> is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still performed; this can be used to check for the existence of a process ID or process group ID.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For a process to have permission to send a signal it must either be privileged (under Linux: have the <b>CAP_KILL</b> capability), or the real or effective user ID of the sending process must equal the real or saved set-user-ID of the target process. In the case of <b>SIGCONT</b> it suffices when the sending and receiving processes belong to the same session.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> On success (at least one signal was sent), zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set appropriately.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
An invalid signal was specified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EPERM</b></dt>
<dd>
The process does not have permission to send the signal to any of the target processes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>ESRCH</b></dt>
<dd>
The pid or process group does not exist. Note that an existing process might be a zombie, a process which already committed termination, but has not yet been <b>wait</b>(2)ed for.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> The only signals that can be sent to process ID 1, the <i>init</i> process, are those for which <i>init</i> has explicitly installed signal handlers. This is done to assure the system is not brought down accidentally.<div class="spacer">
</div>
POSIX.1-2001 requires that <i>kill(-1,sig)</i> send <i>sig</i> to all processes that the calling process may send signals to, except possibly for some implementation-defined system processes. Linux allows a process to signal itself, but on Linux the call  <i>kill(-1,sig)</i> does not signal the calling process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
POSIX.1-2001 requires that if a process sends a signal to itself, and the sending thread does not have the signal blocked, and no other thread has it unblocked or is waiting for it in <b>sigwait</b>(3), at least one unblocked signal must be delivered to the sending thread before the <b>kill</b>() returns.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Linux Notes</h2> Across different kernel versions, Linux has enforced different rules for the permissions required for an unprivileged process to send a signal to another process. In kernels 1.0 to 1.2.2, a signal could be sent if the effective user ID of the sender matched that of the receiver, or the real user ID of the sender matched that of the receiver. From kernel 1.2.3 until 1.3.77, a signal could be sent if the effective user ID of the sender matched either the real or effective user ID of the receiver. The current rules, which conform to POSIX.1-2001, were adopted in kernel 1.3.78.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS</h1> In 2.6 kernels up to and including 2.6.7, there was a bug that meant that when sending signals to a process group, <b>kill</b>() failed with the error <b>EPERM</b> if the caller did have permission to send the signal to  <i>any</i> (rather than  <i>all</i>) of the members of the process group. Notwithstanding this error return, the signal was still delivered to all of the processes for which the caller had permission to signal.</div>
