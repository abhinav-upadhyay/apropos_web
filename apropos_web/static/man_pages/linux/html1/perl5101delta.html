<h1>NAME</h1> perl5101delta - what is new for perl v5.10.1</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.10.0 release and the 5.10.1 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.8.8, first read the perl5100delta, which describes differences between 5.8.8 and 5.10.0</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Switch statement changes</h2> The handling of complex expressions by the &quot;given&quot;/&quot;when&quot; switch statement has been enhanced. There are two new cases where &quot;when&quot; now interprets its argument as a boolean, instead of an expression to be used in a smart match:<dl>
<dt>
flip-flop operators</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;..&quot; and &quot;...&quot; flip-flop operators are now evaluated in boolean context, following their usual semantics; see &quot;Range Operators&quot; in perlop.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that, as in perl 5.10.0, &quot;when (1..10)&quot; will not work to test whether a given value is an integer between 1 and 10; you should use &quot;when ([1..10])&quot; instead (note the array reference).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
However, contrary to 5.10.0, evaluating the flip-flop operators in boolean context ensures it can now be useful in a &quot;when()&quot;, notably for implementing bistable conditions, like in:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    when (/^=begin/ .. /^=end/) {<br/>
      # do something<br/>
    }<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
defined-or operator</dt>
<dd>
A compound expression involving the defined-or operator, as in &quot;when (expr1 // expr2)&quot;, will be treated as boolean if the first expression is boolean. (This just extends the existing rule that applies to the regular or operator, as in &quot;when (expr1 || expr2)&quot;.)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The next section details more changes brought to the semantics to the smart match operator, that naturally also modify the behaviour of the switch statements where smart matching is implicitly used.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Smart match changes</h2>  <i>Changes to type-based dispatch</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The smart match operator &quot;~~&quot; is no longer commutative. The behaviour of a smart match now depends primarily on the type of its right hand argument. Moreover, its semantics have been adjusted for greater consistency or usefulness in several cases. While the general backwards compatibility is maintained, several changes must be noted:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Code references with an empty prototype are no longer treated specially. They are passed an argument like the other code references (even if they choose to ignore it).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;%hash ~~ sub {}&quot; and &quot;@array ~~ sub {}&quot; now test that the subroutine returns a true value for each key of the hash (or element of the array), instead of passing the whole hash or array as a reference to the subroutine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Due to the commutativity breakage, code references are no longer treated specially when appearing on the left of the &quot;~~&quot; operator, but like any vulgar scalar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;undef ~~ %hash&quot; is always false (since &quot;undef&quot; can't be a key in a hash). No implicit conversion to &quot;&quot; is done (as was the case in perl 5.10.0).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;$scalar ~~ @array&quot; now always distributes the smart match across the elements of the array. It's true if one element in @array verifies &quot;$scalar ~~ $element&quot;. This is a generalization of the old behaviour that tested whether the array contained the scalar.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The full dispatch table for the smart match operator is given in &quot;Smart matching in detail&quot; in perlsyn.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Smart match and overloading</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
According to the rule of dispatch based on the rightmost argument type, when an object overloading &quot;~~&quot; appears on the right side of the operator, the overload routine will always be called (with a 3rd argument set to a true value, see overload.) However, when the object will appear on the left, the overload routine will be called only when the rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way distributivity of smart match across arrays is not broken, as well as the other behaviours with complex types (coderefs, hashes, regexes). Thus, writers of overloading routines for smart match mostly need to worry only with comparing against a scalar, and possibly with stringification overloading; the other common cases will be automatically handled consistently.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;~~&quot; will now refuse to work on objects that do not overload it (in order to avoid relying on the object's underlying structure). (However, if the object overloads the stringification or the numification operators, and if overload fallback is active, it will be used instead, as usual.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Other incompatible changes</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The semantics of &quot;use feature :5.10*&quot; have changed slightly. See &quot;Modules and Pragmata&quot; for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
It is now a run-time error to use the smart match operator &quot;~~&quot; with an object that has no overload defined for it. (This way &quot;~~&quot; will not break encapsulation by matching against the object's internal representation as a reference.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The version control system used for the development of the perl interpreter has been switched from Perforce to git.  This is mainly an internal issue that only affects people actively working on the perl core; but it may have minor external visibility, for example in some of details of the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;. See perlrepository for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The internal structure of the &quot;ext/&quot; directory in the perl source has been reorganised. In general, a module &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; whose source was stored under  <i>ext/Foo/Bar/</i> is now located under <i>ext/Foo-Bar/</i>. Also, some modules have been moved from  <i>lib/</i> to <i>ext/</i>. This is purely a source tarball change, and should make no difference to the compilation or installation of perl, unless you have a very customised build process that explicitly relies on this structure, or which hard-codes the &quot;nonxs_ext&quot;  <i>Configure</i> parameter. Specifically, this change does not by default alter the location of any files in the final installation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
As part of the &quot;Test::Harness&quot; 2.x to 3.x upgrade, the experimental &quot;Test::Harness::Straps&quot; module has been removed. See &quot;Updated Modules&quot; for more details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
As part of the &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; upgrade, the &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::bytes&quot; and &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::vmsish&quot; modules have been removed from this distribution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;Module::CoreList&quot; no longer contains the %:patchlevel hash.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
This one is actually a change introduced in 5.10.0, but it was missed from that release's perldelta, so it is mentioned here instead.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A bugfix related to the handling of the &quot;/m&quot; modifier and &quot;qr&quot; resulted in a change of behaviour between 5.8.x and 5.10.0:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    # matches in 5.8.x, doesn't match in 5.10.0<br/>
    $re = qr/^bar/; &quot;foo\nbar&quot; =~ /$re/m;<br/>
</dd>

<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode Character Database 5.1.0</h2> The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.10.1 has been updated to 5.1.0 from 5.0.0. See &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/#Notable_Changes&gt; for the notable changes.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>A proper interface for pluggable Method Resolution Orders</h2> As of Perl 5.10.1 there is a new interface for plugging and using method resolution orders other than the default (linear depth first search). The C3 method resolution order added in 5.10.0 has been re-implemented as a plugin, without changing its Perl-space interface. See perlmroapi for more information.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The &quot;overloading&quot; pragma</h2> This pragma allows you to lexically disable or enable overloading for some or all operations. (Yuval Kogman)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Parallel tests</h2> The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on Unix-like platforms. Instead of running &quot;make test&quot;, set &quot;TEST_JOBS&quot; in your environment to the number of tests to run in parallel, and run &quot;make test_harness&quot;. On a Bourne-like shell, this can be done as<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness  # Run 3 tests in parallel<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
An environment variable is used, rather than parallel make itself, because TAP::Harness needs to be able to schedule individual non-conflicting test scripts itself, and there is no standard interface to &quot;make&quot; utilities to interact with their job schedulers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that currently some test scripts may fail when run in parallel (most notably &quot;ext/IO/t/io_dir.t&quot;). If necessary run just the failing scripts again sequentially and see if the failures go away.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>DTrace support</h2> Some support for DTrace has been added. See &quot;DTrace support&quot; in  <i>INSTALL</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Support for &quot;configure_requires&quot; in CPAN module metadata</h2> Both &quot;CPAN&quot; and &quot;CPANPLUS&quot; now support the &quot;configure_requires&quot; keyword in the &quot;META.yml&quot; metadata file included in most recent CPAN distributions. This allows distribution authors to specify configuration prerequisites that must be installed before running  <i>Makefile.PL</i> or <i>Build.PL</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the documentation for &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; or &quot;Module::Build&quot; for more on how to specify &quot;configure_requires&quot; when creating a distribution for CPAN.</div>

This is a new lexically-scoped alternative for the &quot;Fatal&quot; module. The bundled version is 2.06_01.

The meaning of the &quot;:5.10&quot; and &quot;:5.10.X&quot; feature bundles has changed slightly. The last component, if any (i.e. &quot;X&quot;) is simply ignored. This is predicated on the assumption that new features will not, in general, be added to maintenance releases. So &quot;:5.10&quot; and &quot;:5.10.X&quot; have identical effect.

Perl 5.10.1 adds a new utility <i>perlthanks</i>, which is a variant of  <i>perlbug</i>, but for sending non-bug-reports to the authors and maintainers of Perl. Getting nothing but bug reports can become a bit demoralising: we'll see if this changes things.</dd>

<h1>Changes to Existing Documentation</h1> The various large &quot;Changes*&quot; files (which listed every change made to perl over the last 18 years) have been removed, and replaced by a small file, also called &quot;Changes&quot;, which just explains how that same information may be extracted from the git version control system.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The file <i>Porting/patching.pod</i> has been deleted, as it mainly described interacting with the old Perforce-based repository, which is now obsolete. Information still relevant has been moved to perlrepository.<div class="spacer">

<h1>Installation and Configuration Improvements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2><i>ext/</i> reorganisation</h2> The layout of directories in  <i>ext</i> has been revised. Specifically, all extensions are now flat, and at the top level, with &quot;/&quot; in pathnames replaced by &quot;-&quot;, so that  <i>ext/Data/Dumper/</i> is now <i>ext/Data-Dumper/</i>, etc.  The names of the extensions as specified to  <i>Configure</i>, and as reported by %Config::Config under the keys &quot;dynamic_ext&quot;, &quot;known_extensions&quot;, &quot;nonxs_ext&quot; and &quot;static_ext&quot; have not changed, and still use &quot;/&quot;. Hence this change will not have any affect once perl is installed. However, &quot;Attribute::Handlers&quot;, &quot;Safe&quot; and &quot;mro&quot; have now become extensions in their own right, so if you run  <i>Configure</i> with options to specify an exact list of extensions to build, you will need to change it to account for this.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For 5.10.2, it is planned that many dual-life modules will have been moved from  <i>lib</i> to <i>ext</i>; again this will have no effect on an installed perl, but will matter if you invoke  <i>Configure</i> with a pre-canned list of extensions to build.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Configuration improvements</h2> If &quot;vendorlib&quot; and &quot;vendorarch&quot; are the same, then they are only added to @INC once.<div class="spacer">
</div>
$Config{usedevel} and the C-level &quot;PERL_USE_DEVEL&quot; are now defined if perl is built with  &quot;-Dusedevel&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Configure</i> will enable use of &quot;-fstack-protector&quot;, to provide protection against stack-smashing attacks, if the compiler supports it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Configure</i> will now determine the correct prototypes for re-entrant functions, and for &quot;gconvert&quot;, if you are using a C++ compiler rather than a C compiler.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On Unix, if you build from a tree containing a git repository, the configuration process will note the commit hash you have checked out, for display in the output of &quot;perl -v&quot; and &quot;perl -V&quot;. Unpushed local commits are automatically added to the list of local patches displayed by &quot;perl -V&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Compilation improvements</h2> As part of the flattening of  <i>ext</i>, all extensions on all platforms are built by  <i>make_ext.pl</i>. This replaces the Unix-specific  <i>ext/util/make_ext</i>, VMS-specific <i>make_ext.com</i> and Win32-specific  <i>win32/buildext.pl</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Platform Specific Changes</h2><dl>
<dt>
AIX</dt>
<dd>
Removed <i>libbsd</i> for AIX 5L and 6.1. Only <i>flock()</i> was used from <i>libbsd</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Removed <i>libgdbm</i> for AIX 5L and 6.1. The <i>libgdbm</i> is delivered as an optional package with the AIX Toolbox. Unfortunately the 64 bit version is broken.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Hints changes mean that AIX 4.2 should work again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Cygwin</dt>
<dd>
On Cygwin we now strip the last number from the DLL. This has been the behaviour in the cygwin.com build for years. The hints files have been updated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
FreeBSD</dt>
<dd>
The hints files now identify the correct threading libraries on FreeBSD 7 and later.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Irix</dt>
<dd>
We now work around a bizarre preprocessor bug in the Irix 6.5 compiler: &quot;cc -E -&quot; unfortunately goes into K&amp;R mode, but &quot;cc -E file.c&quot; doesn't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

Symbian</dt>
<dd>
There is now support for Symbian S60 3.2 SDK and S60 5.0 SDK.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Win32</dt>
<dd>
Improved message window handling means that &quot;alarm&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; messages will no longer be dropped under race conditions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
VMS</dt>
<dd>
Reads from the in-memory temporary files of &quot;PerlIO::scalar&quot; used to fail if $/ was set to a numeric reference (to indicate record-style reads). This is now fixed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
VMS now supports &quot;getgrgid&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Many improvements and cleanups have been made to the VMS file name handling and conversion code.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Enabling the &quot;PERL_VMS_POSIX_EXIT&quot; logical name now encodes a POSIX exit status in a VMS condition value for better interaction with GNV's bash shell and other utilities that depend on POSIX exit values.  See &quot;$?&quot; in perlvms for details.</dd>

<h1>Selected Bug Fixes</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
5.10.0 inadvertently disabled an optimisation, which caused a measurable performance drop in list assignment, such as is often used to assign function parameters from @_. The optimisation has been re-instated, and the performance regression fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Fixed memory leak on &quot;while (1) { map 1, 1 }&quot; [RT #53038].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Some potential coredumps in PerlIO fixed [RT #57322,54828].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The debugger now works with lvalue subroutines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The debugger's &quot;m&quot; command was broken on modules that defined constants [RT #61222].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;crypt()&quot; and string complement could return tainted values for untainted arguments [RT #59998].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;-i.suffix&quot; command-line switch now recreates the file using restricted permissions, before changing its mode to match the original file. This eliminates a potential race condition [RT #60904].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
On some Unix systems, the value in $? would not have the top bit set (&quot;$? &amp; 128&quot;) even if the child core dumped.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Under some circumstances, $^R could incorrectly become undefined [RT #57042].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
(XS) In various hash functions, passing a pre-computed hash to when the key is UTF-8 might result in an incorrect lookup.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
(XS) Including <i>XSUB.h</i> before <i>perl.h</i> gave a compile-time error [RT #57176].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;$object-&gt;isa('Foo')&quot; would report false if the package &quot;Foo&quot; didn't exist, even if the object's @ISA contained &quot;Foo&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Various bugs in the new-to 5.10.0 mro code, triggered by manipulating @ISA, have been found and fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Bitwise operations on references could crash the interpreter, e.g. &quot;$x=\$y; $x |= &quot;foo&quot;&quot; [RT #54956].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Patterns including alternation might be sensitive to the internal UTF-8 representation, e.g.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $byte = chr(192);<br/>
    my $utf8 = chr(192); utf8::upgrade($utf8);<br/>
    $utf8 =~ /$byte|X}/i;       # failed in 5.10.0<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Within UTF8-encoded Perl source files (i.e. where &quot;use utf8&quot; is in effect), double-quoted literal strings could be corrupted where a &quot;\xNN&quot;, &quot;\0NNN&quot; or &quot;\N{}&quot; is followed by a literal character with ordinal value greater than 255 [RT #59908].</dd>

A macro MUTABLE_PTR(p) has been added, which on (non-pedantic) gcc will not cast away &quot;const&quot;, returning a &quot;void *&quot;.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
