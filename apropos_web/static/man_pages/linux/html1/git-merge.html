<h1>NAME</h1> git-merge - Join two or more development histories together</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
<i>git merge</i> [-n] [--stat] [--no-commit] [--squash] [--[no-]edit]<br/>
        [-s &lt;strategy&gt;] [-X &lt;strategy-option&gt;] [-S[&lt;keyid&gt;]]<br/>
        [--[no-]rerere-autoupdate] [-m &lt;msg&gt;] [&lt;commit&gt;...]<br/>
<i>git merge</i> &lt;msg&gt; HEAD &lt;commit&gt;...<br/>
<i>git merge</i> --abort<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch. This command is used by  <i>git pull</i> to incorporate changes from another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into another.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Assume the following history exists and the current branch is &quot;master&quot;:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
          A---B---C topic<br/>
         /<br/>
    D---E---F---G master<br/>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Then &quot;git merge topic&quot; will replay the changes made on the topic branch since it diverged from master (i.e., E) until its current commit (C) on top of master, and record the result in a new commit along with the names of the two parent commits and a log message from the user describing the changes.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
          A---B---C topic<br/>
         /         \<br/>
    D---E---F---G---H master<br/>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The second syntax (&lt;msg&gt; HEAD &lt;commit&gt;...) is supported for historical reasons. Do not use it from the command line or in new scripts. It is the same as git merge -m &lt;msg&gt; &lt;commit&gt;....<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The third syntax (&quot;git merge --abort&quot;) can only be run after the merge has resulted in conflicts. <i>git merge --abort</i> will abort the merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state. However, if there were uncommitted changes when the merge started (and especially if those changes were further modified after the merge was started), <i>git merge --abort</i> will in some cases be unable to reconstruct the original (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Warning</b>: Running <i>git merge</i> with non-trivial uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> --commit, --no-commit<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be used to override --no-commit.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With --no-commit perform the merge but pretend the merge failed and do not autocommit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further tweak the merge result before committing.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--edit, -e, --no-edit<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user can explain and justify the merge. The --no-edit option can be used to accept the auto-generated message (this is generally discouraged). The --edit (or -e) option is still useful if you are giving a draft message with the -m option from the command line and want to edit it in the editor.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not allowing the user to edit the merge log message. They will see an editor opened when they run git merge. To make it easier to adjust such scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment variable GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT can be set to no at the beginning of them.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--ff<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
When the merge resolves as a fast-forward, only update the branch pointer, without creating a merge commit. This is the default behavior.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--no-ff<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Create a merge commit even when the merge resolves as a fast-forward. This is the default behaviour when merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--ff-only<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status unless the current HEAD is already up-to-date or the merge can be resolved as a fast-forward.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--log[=&lt;n&gt;], --no-log<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with one-line descriptions from at most &lt;n&gt; actual commits that are being merged. See also  <b>git-fmt-merge-msg</b>(1).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With --no-log do not list one-line descriptions from the actual commits being merged.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--stat, -n, --no-stat<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is also controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With -n or --no-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the merge.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--squash, --no-squash<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually make a commit, move the HEAD, or record $GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD (to cause the next git commit command to create a merge commit). This allows you to create a single commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the same as merging another branch (or more in case of an octopus).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With --no-squash perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be used to override --squash.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
-s &lt;strategy&gt;, --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than once to specify them in the order they should be tried. If there is no -s option, a built-in list of strategies is used instead ( <i>git merge-recursive</i> when merging a single head,  <i>git merge-octopus</i> otherwise).</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
-X &lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge strategy.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--verify-signatures, --no-verify-signatures<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Verify that the commits being merged have good and trusted GPG signatures and abort the merge in case they do not.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--summary, --no-summary<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated and will be removed in the future.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
-q, --quiet<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Operate quietly. Implies --no-progress.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
-v, --verbose<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Be verbose.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--progress, --no-progress<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified, progress is shown if standard error is connected to a terminal. Note that not all merge strategies may support progress reporting.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
-S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;]<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The keyid argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the option without a space.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
-m &lt;msg&gt;<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Set the commit message to be used for the merge commit (in case one is created).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If --log is specified, a shortlog of the commits being merged will be appended to the specified message.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The  <i>git fmt-merge-msg</i> command can be used to give a good default for automated  <i>git merge</i> invocations. The automated message can include the branch description.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--[no-]rerere-autoupdate<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Allow the rerere mechanism to update the index with the result of auto-conflict resolution if possible.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
--abort<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If there were uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge started,  <i>git merge --abort</i> will in some cases be unable to reconstruct these changes. It is therefore recommended to always commit or stash your changes before running  <i>git merge</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>git merge --abort</i> is equivalent to  <i>git reset --merge</i> when MERGE_HEAD is present.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
&lt;commit&gt;...<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Commits, usually other branch heads, to merge into our branch. Specifying more than one commit will create a merge with more than two parents (affectionately called an Octopus merge).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If no commit is given from the command line, merge the remote-tracking branches that the current branch is configured to use as its upstream. See also the configuration section of this manual page.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When FETCH_HEAD (and no other commit) is specified, the branches recorded in the .git/FETCH_HEAD file by the previous invocation of git fetch for merging are merged to the current branch.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>PRE-MERGE CHECKS</h1> Before applying outside changes, you should get your own work in good shape and committed locally, so it will not be clobbered if there are conflicts. See also  <b>git-stash</b>(1). <i>git pull</i> and <i>git merge</i> will stop without doing anything when local uncommitted changes overlap with files that <i>git pull</i>/<i>git merge</i> may need to update.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To avoid recording unrelated changes in the merge commit, <i>git pull</i> and <i>git merge</i> will also abort if there are any changes registered in the index relative to the HEAD commit. (One exception is when the changed index entries are in the state that would result from the merge already.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If all named commits are already ancestors of HEAD, <i>git merge</i> will exit early with the message &quot;Already up-to-date.&quot;</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FAST-FORWARD MERGE</h1> Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit. This is the most common case especially when invoked from  <i>git pull</i>: you are tracking an upstream repository, you have committed no local changes, and now you want to update to a newer upstream revision. In this case, a new commit is not needed to store the combined history; instead, the HEAD (along with the index) is updated to point at the named commit, without creating an extra merge commit.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This behavior can be suppressed with the --no-ff option.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>TRUE MERGE</h1> Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to be merged must be tied together by a merge commit that has both of them as its parents.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A merged version reconciling the changes from all branches to be merged is committed, and your HEAD, index, and working tree are updated to it. It is possible to have modifications in the working tree as long as they do not overlap; the update will preserve them.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When it is not obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following happens:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
 1.The HEAD pointer stays the same.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
 2.The MERGE_HEAD ref is set to point to the other branch head.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
 3.Paths that merged cleanly are updated both in the index file and in your working tree.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
 4.For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three versions: stage 1 stores the version from the common ancestor, stage 2 from HEAD, and stage 3 from MERGE_HEAD (you can inspect the stages with git ls-files -u). The working tree files contain the result of the &quot;merge&quot; program; i.e. 3-way merge results with familiar conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt; === &gt;&gt;&gt;.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
 5.No other changes are made. In particular, the local modifications you had before you started merge will stay the same and the index entries for them stay as they were, i.e. matching HEAD.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and want to start over, you can recover with git merge --abort.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>MERGING TAG</h1> When merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git always creates a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible, and the commit message template is prepared with the tag message. Additionally, if the tag is signed, the signature check is reported as a comment in the message template. See also  <b>git-tag</b>(1).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When you want to just integrate with the work leading to the commit that happens to be tagged, e.g. synchronizing with an upstream release point, you may not want to make an unnecessary merge commit.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In such a case, you can &quot;unwrap&quot; the tag yourself before feeding it to git merge, or pass --ff-only when you do not have any work on your own. e.g.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
git fetch origin<br/>
git merge v1.2.3^0<br/>
git merge --ff-only v1.2.3<br/>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED</h1> During a merge, the working tree files are updated to reflect the result of the merge. Among the changes made to the common ancestor&#8217;s version, non-overlapping ones (that is, you changed an area of the file while the other side left that area intact, or vice versa) are incorporated in the final result verbatim. When both sides made changes to the same area, however, Git cannot randomly pick one side over the other, and asks you to resolve it by leaving what both sides did to that area.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
By default, Git uses the same style as the one used by the &quot;merge&quot; program from the RCS suite to present such a conflicted hunk, like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common<br/>
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt<br/>
Conflict resolution is hard;<br/>
let's go shopping.<br/>
=======<br/>
Git makes conflict resolution easy.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt<br/>
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.<br/>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked with markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. The part before the ======= is typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their side.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The default format does not show what the original said in the conflicting area. You cannot tell how many lines are deleted and replaced with Barbie&#8217;s remark on your side. The only thing you can tell is that your side wants to say it is hard and you&#8217;d prefer to go shopping, while the other side wants to claim it is easy.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An alternative style can be used by setting the &quot;merge.conflictStyle&quot; configuration variable to &quot;diff3&quot;. In &quot;diff3&quot; style, the above conflict may look like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common<br/>
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt<br/>
Conflict resolution is hard;<br/>
let's go shopping.<br/>
|||||||<br/>
Conflict resolution is hard.<br/>
=======<br/>
Git makes conflict resolution easy.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt<br/>
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.<br/>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In addition to the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; markers, it uses another ||||||| marker that is followed by the original text. You can tell that the original just stated a fact, and your side simply gave in to that statement and gave up, while the other side tried to have a more positive attitude. You can sometimes come up with a better resolution by viewing the original.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS</h1> After seeing a conflict, you can do two things:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;Decide not to merge. The only clean-ups you need are to reset the index file to the HEAD commit to reverse 2. and to clean up working tree changes made by 2. and 3.; git merge --abort can be used for this.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;Resolve the conflicts. Git will mark the conflicts in the working tree. Edit the files into shape and  <i>git add</i> them to the index. Use  <i>git commit</i> to seal the deal.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can work through the conflict with a number of tools:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;Use a mergetool. git mergetool to launch a graphical mergetool which will work you through the merge.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;Look at the diffs. git diff will show a three-way diff, highlighting changes from both the HEAD and MERGE_HEAD versions.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;Look at the diffs from each branch. git log --merge -p &lt;path&gt; will show diffs first for the HEAD version and then the MERGE_HEAD version.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;Look at the originals. git show :1:filename shows the common ancestor, git show :2:filename shows the HEAD version, and git show :3:filename shows the MERGE_HEAD version.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;Merge branches fixes and enhancements on top of the current branch, making an octopus merge:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
$ git merge fixes enhancements<br/>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;Merge branch obsolete into the current branch, using ours merge strategy:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
$ git merge -s ours obsolete<br/>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;Merge branch maint into the current branch, but do not make a new commit automatically:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
$ git merge --no-commit maint<br/>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This can be used when you want to include further changes to the merge, or want to write your own merge commit message.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You should refrain from abusing this option to sneak substantial changes into a merge commit. Small fixups like bumping release/version name would be acceptable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>MERGE STRATEGIES</h1> The merge mechanism (git merge and git pull commands) allows the backend  <i>merge strategies</i> to be chosen with -s option. Some strategies can also take their own options, which can be passed by giving -X&lt;option&gt; arguments to git merge and/or git pull.<div class="spacer">
</div>
resolve<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge algorithm. It tries to carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities and is considered generally safe and fast.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
recursive<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The  <i>recursive</i> strategy can take the following options:<div class="spacer">
</div>
ours<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly by favoring  <i>our</i> version. Changes from the other tree that do not conflict with our side are reflected to the merge result. For a binary file, the entire contents are taken from our side.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This should not be confused with the  <i>ours</i> merge strategy, which does not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It discards everything the other tree did, declaring  <i>our</i> history contains all that happened in it.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
theirs<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
This is the opposite of  <i>ours</i>.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
patience<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
With this option,  <i>merge-recursive</i> spends a little extra time to avoid mismerges that sometimes occur due to unimportant matching lines (e.g., braces from distinct functions). Use this when the branches to be merged have diverged wildly. See also  <b>git-diff</b>(1) --patience.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Tells  <i>merge-recursive</i> to use a different diff algorithm, which can help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant matching lines (such as braces from distinct functions). See also  <b>git-diff</b>(1) --diff-algorithm.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
ignore-space-change, ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace changes mixed with other changes to a line are not ignored. See also  <b>git-diff</b>(1) -b, -w, and --ignore-space-at-eol.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;If  <i>their</i> version only introduces whitespace changes to a line,  <i>our</i> version is used;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;If  <i>our</i> version introduces whitespace changes but  <i>their</i> version includes a substantial change,  <i>their</i> version is used;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
&#8226;Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual way.</div>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
renormalize<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three stages of a file when resolving a three-way merge. This option is meant to be used when merging branches with different clean filters or end-of-line normalization rules. See &quot;Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout attributes&quot; in  <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
no-renormalize<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Disables the renormalize option. This overrides the merge.renormalize configuration variable.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
no-renames<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Turn off rename detection. See also  <b>git-diff</b>(1) --no-renames.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the similarity threshold. This is the default. See also  <b>git-diff</b>(1) --find-renames.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
rename-threshold=&lt;n&gt;<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Deprecated synonym for find-renames=&lt;n&gt;.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
subtree[=&lt;path&gt;]<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
This option is a more advanced form of  <i>subtree</i> strategy, where the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to match with each other when merging. Instead, the specified path is prefixed (or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of two trees to match.</div>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
octopus<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do a complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one branch.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
ours<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring all changes from all other branches. It is meant to be used to supersede old development history of side branches. Note that this is different from the -Xours option to the  <i>recursive</i> merge strategy.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
subtree<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default, <i>recursive</i>), if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one of the branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some people find this behavior confusing. It occurs because only the heads and the merge base are considered when performing a merge, not the individual commits. The merge algorithm therefore considers the reverted change as no change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> merge.conflictStyle<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written out to working tree files upon merge. The default is &quot;merge&quot;, which shows a &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; conflict marker, changes made by one side, a ======= marker, changes made by the other side, and then a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marker. An alternate style, &quot;diff3&quot;, adds a ||||||| marker and the original text before the ======= marker.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
merge.defaultToUpstream<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the upstream branches configured for the current branch by using their last observed values stored in their remote-tracking branches. The values of the branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.merge that name the branches at the remote named by branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.remote are consulted, and then they are mapped via remote.&lt;remote&gt;.fetch to their corresponding remote-tracking branches, and the tips of these tracking branches are merged.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
merge.ff<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to false, this variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent to giving the --no-ff option from the command line). When set to only, only such fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving the --ff-only option from the command line).</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
merge.branchdesc<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with the branch description text associated with them. Defaults to false.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
merge.log<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at most the specified number of one-line descriptions from the actual commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a synonym for 20.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
merge.renameLimit<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
The number of files to consider when performing rename detection during a merge; if not specified, defaults to the value of diff.renameLimit.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
merge.renormalize<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the repository has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record text files with CRLF line endings, but recent ones use LF line endings). In such a repository, Git can convert the data recorded in commits to a canonical form before performing a merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For more information, see section &quot;Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout attributes&quot; in  <b>gitattributes</b>(5).</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
merge.stat<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Whether to print the diffstat between ORIG_HEAD and the merge result at the end of the merge. True by default.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
merge.tool<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Controls which merge tool is used by  <b>git-mergetool</b>(1). The list below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated as a custom merge tool and requires that a corresponding mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
