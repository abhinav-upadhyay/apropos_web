<h1>NAME</h1> perlwin32 - Perl under Windows</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> These are instructions for building Perl under Windows 2000 and later.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> Before you start, you should glance through the README file found in the top-level directory to which the Perl distribution was extracted.  Make sure you read and understand the terms under which this software is being distributed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Also make sure you read &quot;BUGS AND CAVEATS&quot; below for the known limitations of this port.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The INSTALL file in the perl top-level has much information that is only relevant to people building Perl on Unix-like systems.  In particular, you can safely ignore any information that talks about &quot;Configure&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may also want to look at one other option for building a perl that will work on Windows: the README.cygwin file, which give a different set of rules to build a perl for Windows.  This method will probably enable you to build a more Unix-compatible perl, but you will also need to download and use various other build-time and run-time support software described in that file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This set of instructions is meant to describe a so-called &quot;native&quot; port of Perl to the Windows platform.  This includes both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows operating systems.  The resulting Perl requires no additional software to run (other than what came with your operating system).  Currently, this port is capable of using one of the following compilers on the Intel x86 architecture:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
      Borland C++             version 5.02 or later<br/>
      Microsoft Visual C++    version 6.0 or later<br/>
      Gcc by mingw.org        gcc version 3.2 or later<br/>
      Gcc by mingw-w64.sf.net gcc version 4.4.3 or later<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that the last two of these are actually competing projects both delivering complete gcc toolchain for MS Windows:<dl>
<dt>
&lt;http://mingw.org&gt;</dt>
<dd>
Delivers gcc toolchain targeting 32-bit Windows platform.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
http://mingw-w64.sf.net &lt;http://mingw-w64.sf.net&gt;</dt>
<dd>
Delivers gcc toolchain targeting both 64-bit Windows and 32-bit Windows platforms (despite the project name &quot;mingw-w64&quot; they are not only 64-bit oriented). They deliver the native gcc compilers and cross-compilers that are also supported by perl's makefile.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Borland C++ and Microsoft Visual C++ compilers are also now being given away free.  The Borland compiler is available as &quot;Borland C++ Compiler Free Command Line Tools&quot; and is the same compiler that ships with the full &quot;Borland C++ Builder&quot; product.  The Microsoft compiler is available as &quot;Visual C++ Toolkit 2003&quot; or &quot;Visual C++ 2005/2008/2010 Express Edition&quot; (and also as part of the &quot;.NET Framework SDK&quot;) and is the same compiler that ships with &quot;Visual C++ .NET 2003 Professional&quot; or &quot;Visual C++ 2005/2008/2010 Professional&quot; respectively.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This port can also be built on IA64/AMD64 using:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
      Microsoft Platform SDK    Nov 2001 (64-bit compiler and tools)<br/>
      MinGW64 compiler (gcc version 4.4.3 or later)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Windows SDK can be downloaded from &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/&gt;. The MinGW64 compiler is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64 &lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64&gt;. The latter is actually a cross-compiler targeting Win64. There's also a trimmed down compiler (no java, or gfortran) suitable for building perl available at: http://strawberryperl.com/package/kmx/64_gcctoolchain/mingw64-w64-20100123-kmx-v2.zip &lt;http://strawberryperl.com/package/kmx/64_gcctoolchain/mingw64-w64-20100123-kmx-v2.zip&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
NOTE: If you're using a 32-bit compiler to build perl on a 64-bit Windows operating system, then you should set the WIN64 environment variable to &quot;undef&quot;. Also, the trimmed down compiler only passes tests when USE_ITHREADS *= define (as opposed to undef) and when the CFG *= Debug line is commented out.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This port fully supports MakeMaker (the set of modules that is used to build extensions to perl).  Therefore, you should be able to build and install most extensions found in the CPAN sites. See &quot;Usage Hints for Perl on Windows&quot; below for general hints about this.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Setting Up Perl on Windows</h2><dl>
<dt>
Make</dt>
<dd>
You need a &quot;make&quot; program to build the sources.  If you are using Visual C++ or the Windows SDK tools, nmake will work.  Builds using the Borland compiler or gcc need dmake.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
dmake is a freely available make that has very nice macro features and parallelability.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A port of dmake for Windows is available from:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&lt;http://search.cpan.org/dist/dmake/&gt;<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Fetch and install dmake somewhere on your path.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There exists a minor coexistence problem with dmake and Borland C++ compilers.  Namely, if a distribution has C files named with mixed case letters, they will be compiled into appropriate .obj-files named with all lowercase letters, and every time dmake is invoked to bring files up to date, it will try to recompile such files again. For example, Tk distribution has a lot of such files, resulting in needless recompiles every time dmake is invoked.  To avoid this, you may use the script &quot;sync_ext.pl&quot; after a successful build.  It is available in the win32 subdirectory of the Perl source distribution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Command Shell</dt>
<dd>
Use the default &quot;cmd&quot; shell that comes with Windows.  Some versions of the popular 4DOS/NT shell have incompatibilities that may cause you trouble. If the build fails under that shell, try building again with the cmd shell.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Make sure the path to the build directory does not contain spaces.  The build usually works in this circumstance, but some tests will fail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Borland C++</dt>
<dd>
If you are using the Borland compiler, you will need dmake. (The make that Borland supplies is seriously crippled and will not work for MakeMaker builds.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;Make&quot; above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Microsoft Visual C++</dt>
<dd>
The nmake that comes with Visual C++ will suffice for building. You will need to run the VCVARS32.BAT file, usually found somewhere like C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin. This will set your build environment.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can also use dmake to build using Visual C++; provided, however, you set OSRELEASE to &quot;microsft&quot; (or whatever the directory name under which the Visual C dmake configuration lives) in your environment and edit win32/config.vc to change &quot;make=nmake&quot; into &quot;make=dmake&quot;.  The latter step is only essential if you want to use dmake as your default make for building extensions using MakeMaker.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008/2010 Express Edition</dt>
<dd>
These free versions of Visual C++ 2008/2010 Professional contain the same compilers and linkers that ship with the full versions, and also contain everything necessary to build Perl, rather than requiring a separate download of the Windows SDK like previous versions did.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
These packages can be downloaded by searching in the Download Center at &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en&gt;.  (Providing exact links to these packages has proven a pointless task because the links keep on changing so often.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Install Visual C++ 2008/2010 Express, then setup your environment using, e.g.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(assuming the default installation location was chosen).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl should now build using the win32/Makefile.  You will need to edit that file to set CCTYPE to MSVC90FREE or MSVC100FREE first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition</dt>
<dd>
This free version of Visual C++ 2005 Professional contains the same compiler and linker that ship with the full version, but doesn't contain everything necessary to build Perl.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You will also need to download the &quot;Windows SDK&quot; (the &quot;Core SDK&quot; and &quot;MDAC SDK&quot; components are required) for more header files and libraries.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
These packages can both be downloaded by searching in the Download Center at &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en&gt;.  (Providing exact links to these packages has proven a pointless task because the links keep on changing so often.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Try to obtain the latest version of the Windows SDK.  Sometimes these packages contain a particular Windows OS version in their name, but actually work on other OS versions too.  For example, the &quot;Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK&quot; also runs on Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2000.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Install Visual C++ 2005 first, then the Platform SDK.  Setup your environment as follows (assuming default installation locations were chosen):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        SET PlatformSDKDir=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK<br/>
<br/>
        SET PATH=%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\IDE;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\BIN;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\Tools;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\SDK\v2.0\bin;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\VCPackages;%PlatformSDKDir%\Bin<br/>
<br/>
        SET INCLUDE=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\INCLUDE;%PlatformSDKDir%\include<br/>
<br/>
        SET LIB=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\LIB;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\SDK\v2.0\lib;%PlatformSDKDir%\lib<br/>
<br/>
        SET LIBPATH=C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(The PlatformSDKDir might need to be set differently depending on which version you are using. Earlier versions installed into &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDK&quot;, while the latest versions install into version-specific locations such as &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2&quot;.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl should now build using the win32/Makefile.  You will need to edit that file to set<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        CCTYPE = MSVC80FREE<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
and to set CCHOME, CCINCDIR and CCLIBDIR as per the environment setup above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003</dt>
<dd>
This free toolkit contains the same compiler and linker that ship with Visual C++ .NET 2003 Professional, but doesn't contain everything necessary to build Perl.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You will also need to download the &quot;Platform SDK&quot; (the &quot;Core SDK&quot; and &quot;MDAC SDK&quot; components are required) for header files, libraries and rc.exe, and &quot;.NET Framework SDK&quot; for more libraries and nmake.exe.  Note that the latter (which also includes the free compiler and linker) requires the &quot;.NET Framework Redistributable&quot; to be installed first.  This can be downloaded and installed separately, but is included in the &quot;Visual C++ Toolkit 2003&quot; anyway.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
These packages can all be downloaded by searching in the Download Center at &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en&gt;.  (Providing exact links to these packages has proven a pointless task because the links keep on changing so often.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Try to obtain the latest version of the Windows SDK.  Sometimes these packages contain a particular Windows OS version in their name, but actually work on other OS versions too.  For example, the &quot;Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK&quot; also runs on Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2000.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Install the Toolkit first, then the Platform SDK, then the .NET Framework SDK. Setup your environment as follows (assuming default installation locations were chosen):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        SET PlatformSDKDir=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK<br/>
<br/>
        SET PATH=%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003\bin;%PlatformSDKDir%\Bin;C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v1.1\Bin<br/>
<br/>
        SET INCLUDE=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003\include;%PlatformSDKDir%\include;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\include<br/>
<br/>
        SET LIB=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003\lib;%PlatformSDKDir%\lib;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\lib<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(The PlatformSDKDir might need to be set differently depending on which version you are using. Earlier versions installed into &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDK&quot;, while the latest versions install into version-specific locations such as &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2&quot;.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Several required files will still be missing:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
cvtres.exe is required by link.exe when using a .res file.  It is actually installed by the .NET Framework SDK, but into a location such as the following:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Copy it from there to %PlatformSDKDir%\Bin</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
lib.exe is normally used to build libraries, but link.exe with the /lib option also works, so change win32/config.vc to use it instead:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Change the line reading:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        ar='lib'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
to:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        ar='link /lib'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It may also be useful to create a batch file called lib.bat in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003\bin containing:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        @echo off<br/>
        link /lib %*<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
for the benefit of any naughty C extension modules that you might want to build later which explicitly reference &quot;lib&quot; rather than taking their value from $Config{ar}.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
setargv.obj is required to build perlglob.exe (and perl.exe if the USE_SETARGV option is enabled).  The Platform SDK supplies this object file in source form in %PlatformSDKDir%\src\crt.  Copy setargv.c, cruntime.h and internal.h from there to some temporary location and build setargv.obj using<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        cl.exe /c /I. /D_CRTBLD setargv.c<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Then copy setargv.obj to %PlatformSDKDir%\lib<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Alternatively, if you don't need perlglob.exe and don't need to enable the USE_SETARGV option then you can safely just remove all mention of $(GLOBEXE) from win32/Makefile and setargv.obj won't be required anyway.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Perl should now build using the win32/Makefile.  You will need to edit that file to set<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<br/>
        CCTYPE = MSVC70FREE<br/>

Microsoft Platform SDK 64-bit Compiler</dt>
<dd>
The nmake that comes with the Platform SDK will suffice for building Perl.  Make sure you are building within one of the &quot;Build Environment&quot; shells available after you install the Platform SDK from the Start Menu.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
MinGW release 3 with gcc</dt>
<dd>
Perl can be compiled with gcc from MinGW release 3 and later (using gcc 3.2.x and later).  It can be downloaded here:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&lt;http://www.mingw.org/&gt;<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You also need dmake.  See &quot;Make&quot; above on how to get it.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Building</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Make sure you are in the &quot;win32&quot; subdirectory under the perl toplevel. This directory contains a &quot;Makefile&quot; that will work with versions of nmake that come with Visual C++ or the Windows SDK, and a dmake &quot;makefile.mk&quot; that will work for all supported compilers.  The defaults in the dmake makefile are setup to build using MinGW/gcc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Edit the makefile.mk (or Makefile, if you're using nmake) and change the values of INST_DRV and INST_TOP.   You can also enable various build flags.  These are explained in the makefiles.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that it is generally not a good idea to try to build a perl with INST_DRV and INST_TOP set to a path that already exists from a previous build.  In particular, this may cause problems with the lib/ExtUtils/t/Embed.t test, which attempts to build a test program and may end up building against the installed perl's lib/CORE directory rather than the one being tested.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You will have to make sure that CCTYPE is set correctly and that CCHOME points to wherever you installed your compiler. If building with gcc-4.x.x, you'll also need to uncomment the assignment to GCC_4XX and uncomment the assignment to the appropriate GCCHELPERDLL in the makefile.mk.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If building with the cross-compiler provided by mingw-w64.sourceforge.net you'll need to uncomment the line that sets GCCCROSS in the makefile.mk. Do this only if it's the cross-compiler - ie only if the bin folder doesn't contain a gcc.exe. (The cross-compiler does not provide a gcc.exe, g++.exe, ar.exe, etc. Instead, all of these executables are prefixed with 'x86_64-w64-mingw32-'.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The default value for CCHOME in the makefiles for Visual C++ may not be correct for some versions.  Make sure the default exists and is valid.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You may also need to comment out the &quot;DELAYLOAD = ...&quot; line in the Makefile if you're using VC++ 6.0 without the latest service pack and the linker reports an internal error.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you want build some core extensions statically into perl's dll, specify them in the STATIC_EXT macro.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Be sure to read the instructions near the top of the makefiles carefully.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Type &quot;dmake&quot; (or &quot;nmake&quot; if you are using that make).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This should build everything.  Specifically, it will create perl.exe, perl514.dll at the perl toplevel, and various other extension dll's under the lib\auto directory.  If the build fails for any reason, make sure you have done the previous steps correctly.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Testing Perl on Windows</h2> Type &quot;dmake test&quot; (or &quot;nmake test&quot;).  This will run most of the tests from the testsuite (many tests will be skipped).<div class="spacer">
</div>
There should be no test failures.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some test failures may occur if you use a command shell other than the native &quot;cmd.exe&quot;, or if you are building from a path that contains spaces.  So don't do that.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are running the tests from a emacs shell window, you may see failures in op/stat.t.  Run &quot;dmake test-notty&quot; in that case.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you're using the Borland compiler, you may see a failure in op/taint.t arising from the inability to find the Borland Runtime DLLs on the system default path.  You will need to copy the DLLs reported by the messages from where Borland chose to install it, into the Windows system directory (usually somewhere like C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32) and rerun the test.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you're using Borland compiler versions 5.2 and below, you may run into problems finding the correct header files when building extensions.  For example, building the &quot;Tk&quot; extension may fail because both perl and Tk contain a header file called &quot;patchlevel.h&quot;.  The latest Borland compiler (v5.5) is free of this misbehaviour, and it even supports an option -VI- for backward (bugward) compatibility for using the old Borland search algorithm  to locate header files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you run the tests on a FAT partition, you may see some failures for &quot;link()&quot; related tests ( <i>op/write.t</i>, <i>op/stat.t</i> ...). Testing on NTFS avoids these errors.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Furthermore, you should make sure that during &quot;make test&quot; you do not have any GNU tool packages in your path: some toolkits like Unixutils include some tools (&quot;type&quot; for instance) which override the Windows ones and makes tests fail. Remove them from your path while testing to avoid these errors.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Please report any other failures as described under &quot;BUGS AND CAVEATS&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Installation of Perl on Windows</h2> Type &quot;dmake install&quot; (or &quot;nmake install&quot;).  This will put the newly built perl and the libraries under whatever &quot;INST_TOP&quot; points to in the Makefile.  It will also install the pod documentation under &quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\lib\pod&quot; and HTML versions of the same under &quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\lib\pod\html&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To use the Perl you just installed you will need to add a new entry to your PATH environment variable: &quot;$INST_TOP\bin&quot;, e.g.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    set PATH=c:\perl\bin;%PATH%<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you opted to uncomment &quot;INST_VER&quot; and &quot;INST_ARCH&quot; in the makefile then the installation structure is a little more complicated and you will need to add two new PATH components instead: &quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\bin&quot; and &quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\bin\$ARCHNAME&quot;, e.g.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    set PATH=c:\perl\5.6.0\bin;c:\perl\5.6.0\bin\MSWin32-x86;%PATH%<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Usage Hints for Perl on Windows</h2><dl>
<dt>
Environment Variables</dt>
<dd>
The installation paths that you set during the build get compiled into perl, so you don't have to do anything additional to start using that perl (except add its location to your PATH variable).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you put extensions in unusual places, you can set PERL5LIB to a list of paths separated by semicolons where you want perl to look for libraries.  Look for descriptions of other environment variables you can set in perlrun.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

You can also control the shell that perl uses to run <i>system()</i> and backtick commands via PERL5SHELL.  See perlrun.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl does not depend on the registry, but it can look up certain default values if you choose to put them there.  Perl attempts to read entries from &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl&quot; and &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl&quot;. Entries in the former override entries in the latter.  One or more of the following entries (of type REG_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ) may be set:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    lib-$]              version-specific standard library path to add to @INC<br/>
    lib                 standard library path to add to @INC<br/>
    sitelib-$]          version-specific site library path to add to @INC<br/>
    sitelib             site library path to add to @INC<br/>
    vendorlib-$]        version-specific vendor library path to add to @INC<br/>
    vendorlib           vendor library path to add to @INC<br/>
    PERL*               fallback for all %ENV lookups that begin with &quot;PERL&quot;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note the $] in the above is not literal.  Substitute whatever version of perl you want to honor that entry, e.g. 5.6.0.  Paths must be separated with semicolons, as usual on Windows.</dd>

File Globbing</dt>
<dd>
By default, perl handles file globbing using the File::Glob extension, which provides portable globbing.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you want perl to use globbing that emulates the quirks of DOS filename conventions, you might want to consider using File::DosGlob to override the internal  <i>glob()</i> implementation.  See File::DosGlob for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Using perl from the command line</dt>
<dd>
If you are accustomed to using perl from various command-line shells found in UNIX environments, you will be less than pleased with what Windows offers by way of a command shell.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The crucial thing to understand about the Windows environment is that the command line you type in is processed twice before Perl sees it. First, your command shell (usually CMD.EXE) preprocesses the command line, to handle redirection, environment variable expansion, and location of the executable to run. Then, the perl executable splits the remaining command line into individual arguments, using the C runtime library upon which Perl was built.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It is particularly important to note that neither the shell nor the C runtime do any wildcard expansions of command-line arguments (so wildcards need not be quoted).  Also, the quoting behaviours of the shell and the C runtime are rudimentary at best (and may, if you are using a non-standard shell, be inconsistent).  The only (useful) quote character is the double quote (&quot;).  It can be used to protect spaces and other special characters in arguments.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The Windows documentation has almost no description of how the quoting rules are implemented, but here are some general observations based on experiments: The C runtime breaks arguments at spaces and passes them to programs in argc/argv.  Double quotes can be used to prevent arguments with spaces in them from being split up.  You can put a double quote in an argument by escaping it with a backslash and enclosing the whole argument within double quotes.  The backslash and the pair of double quotes surrounding the argument will be stripped by the C runtime.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The file redirection characters &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, and &quot;|&quot; can be quoted by double quotes (although there are suggestions that this may not always be true).  Single quotes are not treated as quotes by the shell or the C runtime, they don't get stripped by the shell (just to make this type of quoting completely useless).  The caret &quot;^&quot; has also been observed to behave as a quoting character, but this appears to be a shell feature, and the caret is not stripped from the command line, so Perl still sees it (and the C runtime phase does not treat the caret as a quote character).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Here are some examples of usage of the &quot;cmd&quot; shell:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This prints two doublequotes:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -e &quot;print '\&quot;\&quot;' &quot;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This does the same:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;\\\&quot;\\\&quot;\&quot; &quot;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This prints &quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; to the file &quot;blurch&quot;:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; &gt; blurch<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This prints &quot;foo&quot; (&quot;bar&quot; disappears into nowhereland):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt; nul<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This prints &quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; into the file &quot;blurch&quot;:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 1&gt; blurch<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This pipes &quot;foo&quot; to the &quot;less&quot; pager and prints &quot;bar&quot; on the console:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; | less<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This pipes &quot;foo\nbar\n&quot; to the less pager:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -le &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | less<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This pipes &quot;foo&quot; to the pager and writes &quot;bar&quot; in the file &quot;blurch&quot;:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt; blurch | less<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Discovering the usefulness of the &quot;command.com&quot; shell on Windows 9x is left as an exercise to the reader :)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
One particularly pernicious problem with the 4NT command shell for Windows is that it (nearly) always treats a % character as indicating that environment variable expansion is needed.  Under this shell, it is therefore important to always double any % characters which you want Perl to see (for example, for hash variables), even when they are quoted.</dd>

Building Extensions</dt>
<dd>
The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) offers a wealth of extensions, some of which require a C compiler to build. Look in &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt; for more information on CPAN.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that not all of the extensions available from CPAN may work in the Windows environment; you should check the information at &lt;http://testers.cpan.org/&gt; before investing too much effort into porting modules that don't readily build.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Most extensions (whether they require a C compiler or not) can be built, tested and installed with the standard mantra:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl Makefile.PL<br/>
    $MAKE<br/>
    $MAKE test<br/>
    $MAKE install<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
where $MAKE is whatever 'make' program you have configured perl to use.  Use &quot;perl -V:make&quot; to find out what this is.  Some extensions may not provide a testsuite (so &quot;$MAKE test&quot; may not do anything or fail), but most serious ones do.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It is important that you use a supported 'make' program, and ensure Config.pm knows about it.  If you don't have nmake, you can either get dmake from the location mentioned earlier or get an old version of nmake reportedly available from:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/nmake15.exe &lt;http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/nmake15.exe&gt;<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Another option is to use the make written in Perl, available from CPAN.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Make/ &lt;http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Make/&gt;<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You may also use dmake.  See &quot;Make&quot; above on how to get it.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that MakeMaker actually emits makefiles with different syntax depending on what 'make' it thinks you are using.  Therefore, it is important that one of the following values appears in Config.pm:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    make='nmake'        # MakeMaker emits nmake syntax<br/>
    make='dmake'        # MakeMaker emits dmake syntax<br/>
    any other value     # MakeMaker emits generic make syntax<br/>
                            (e.g GNU make, or Perl make)<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the value doesn't match the 'make' program you want to use, edit Config.pm to fix it.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If a module implements XSUBs, you will need one of the supported C compilers.  You must make sure you have set up the environment for the compiler for command-line compilation.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If a module does not build for some reason, look carefully for why it failed, and report problems to the module author.  If it looks like the extension building support is at fault, report that with full details of how the build failed using the perlbug utility.</dd>

Command-line Wildcard Expansion</dt>
<dd>
The default command shells on DOS descendant operating systems (such as they are) usually do not expand wildcard arguments supplied to programs.  They consider it the application's job to handle that. This is commonly achieved by linking the application (in our case, perl) with startup code that the C runtime libraries usually provide. However, doing that results in incompatible perl versions (since the behavior of the argv expansion code differs depending on the compiler, and it is even buggy on some compilers).  Besides, it may be a source of frustration if you use such a perl binary with an alternate shell that *does* expand wildcards.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Instead, the following solution works rather well. The nice things about it are 1) you can start using it right away; 2) it is more powerful, because it will do the right thing with a pattern like */*/*.c; 3) you can decide whether you do/don't want to use it; and 4) you can extend the method to add any customizations (or even entirely different kinds of wildcard expansion).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        C:\&gt; copy con c:\perl\lib\Wild.pm<br/>
        # Wild.pm - emulate shell @ARGV expansion on shells that don't<br/>
        use File::DosGlob;<br/>
        @ARGV = map {<br/>
                      my @g = File::DosGlob::glob($_) if /[*?]/;<br/>
                      @g ? @g : $_;<br/>
                    } @ARGV;<br/>
        1;<br/>
        ^Z<br/>
        C:\&gt; set PERL5OPT=-MWild<br/>
        C:\&gt; perl -le &quot;for (@ARGV) { print }&quot; */*/perl*.c<br/>
        p4view/perl/perl.c<br/>
        p4view/perl/perlio.c<br/>
        p4view/perl/perly.c<br/>
        perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c<br/>
        perl5.005/win32/perllib.c<br/>
        perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c<br/>
        perl5.005/win32/perllib.c<br/>
        perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c<br/>
        perl5.005/win32/perllib.c<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note there are two distinct steps there: 1) You'll have to create Wild.pm and put it in your perl lib directory. 2) You'll need to set the PERL5OPT environment variable.  If you want argv expansion to be the default, just set PERL5OPT in your default startup environment.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you are using the Visual C compiler, you can get the C runtime's command line wildcard expansion built into perl binary.  The resulting binary will always expand unquoted command lines, which may not be what you want if you use a shell that does that for you.  The expansion done is also somewhat less powerful than the approach suggested above.</dd>

Notes on 64-bit Windows</dt>
<dd>
Windows .NET Server supports the LLP64 data model on the Intel Itanium architecture.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The LLP64 data model is different from the LP64 data model that is the norm on 64-bit Unix platforms.  In the former, &quot;int&quot; and &quot;long&quot; are both 32-bit data types, while pointers are 64 bits wide.  In addition, there is a separate 64-bit wide integral type, &quot;__int64&quot;.  In contrast, the LP64 data model that is pervasive on Unix platforms provides &quot;int&quot; as the 32-bit type, while both the &quot;long&quot; type and pointers are of 64-bit precision.  Note that both models provide for 64-bits of addressability.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
64-bit Windows running on Itanium is capable of running 32-bit x86 binaries transparently.  This means that you could use a 32-bit build of Perl on a 64-bit system.  Given this, why would one want to build a 64-bit build of Perl?  Here are some reasons why you would bother:</dd>

<h2>Running Perl Scripts</h2> Perl scripts on UNIX use the &quot;#!&quot; (a.k.a &quot;shebang&quot;) line to indicate to the OS that it should execute the file using perl. Windows has no comparable means to indicate arbitrary files are executables.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Instead, all available methods to execute plain text files on Windows rely on the file &quot;extension&quot;.  There are three methods to use this to execute perl scripts:<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>
<dd>
There is a facility called &quot;file extension associations&quot;.  This can be manipulated via the two commands &quot;assoc&quot; and &quot;ftype&quot; that come standard with Windows.  Type &quot;ftype /?&quot; for a complete example of how to set this up for perl scripts (Say what?  You thought Windows wasn't perl-ready? :).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2.</dt>
<dd>
Since file associations don't work everywhere, and there are reportedly bugs with file associations where it does work, the old method of wrapping the perl script to make it look like a regular batch file to the OS, may be used.  The install process makes available the &quot;pl2bat.bat&quot; script which can be used to wrap perl scripts into batch files.  For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        pl2bat foo.pl<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
will create the file &quot;FOO.BAT&quot;.  Note &quot;pl2bat&quot; strips any .pl suffix and adds a .bat suffix to the generated file.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you use the 4DOS/NT or similar command shell, note that &quot;pl2bat&quot; uses the &quot;%*&quot; variable in the generated batch file to refer to all the command line arguments, so you may need to make sure that construct works in batch files.  As of this writing, 4DOS/NT users will need a &quot;ParameterChar = *&quot; statement in their 4NT.INI file or will need to execute &quot;setdos /p*&quot; in the 4DOS/NT startup file to enable this to work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
3.</dt>
<dd>
Using &quot;pl2bat&quot; has a few problems:  the file name gets changed, so scripts that rely on $0 to find what they must do may not run properly; running &quot;pl2bat&quot; replicates the contents of the original script, and so this process can be maintenance intensive if the originals get updated often.  A different approach that avoids both problems is possible.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A script called &quot;runperl.bat&quot; is available that can be copied to any filename (along with the .bat suffix).  For example, if you call it &quot;foo.bat&quot;, it will run the file &quot;foo&quot; when it is executed.  Since you can run batch files on Windows platforms simply by typing the name (without the extension), this effectively runs the file &quot;foo&quot;, when you type either &quot;foo&quot; or &quot;foo.bat&quot;. With this method, &quot;foo.bat&quot; can even be in a different location than the file &quot;foo&quot;, as long as &quot;foo&quot; is available somewhere on the PATH.  If your scripts are on a filesystem that allows symbolic links, you can even avoid copying &quot;runperl.bat&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Here's a diversion:  copy &quot;runperl.bat&quot; to &quot;runperl&quot;, and type &quot;runperl&quot;.  Explain the observed behavior, or lack thereof. :) Hint: .gnidnats llits er'uoy fi ,&quot;lrepnur&quot; eteled :tniH</dd>

<h2>Miscellaneous Things</h2> A full set of HTML documentation is installed, so you should be able to use it if you have a web browser installed on your system.<div class="spacer">

&quot;perldoc&quot; is also a useful tool for browsing information contained in the documentation, especially in conjunction with a pager like &quot;less&quot; (recent versions of which have Windows support).  You may have to set the PAGER environment variable to use a specific pager. &quot;perldoc -f foo&quot; will print information about the perl operator &quot;foo&quot;.<div class="spacer">

One common mistake when using this port with a GUI library like &quot;Tk&quot; is assuming that Perl's normal behavior of opening a command-line window will go away.  This isn't the case.  If you want to start a copy of &quot;perl&quot; without opening a command-line window, use the &quot;wperl&quot; executable built during the installation process.  Usage is exactly the same as normal &quot;perl&quot; on Windows, except that options like &quot;-h&quot; don't work (since they need a command-line window to print to).<div class="spacer">

If you find bugs in perl, you can run &quot;perlbug&quot; to create a bug report (you may have to send it manually if &quot;perlbug&quot; cannot find a mailer on your system).</div>

<h1>BUGS AND CAVEATS</h1> Norton AntiVirus interferes with the build process, particularly if set to &quot;AutoProtect, All Files, when Opened&quot;. Unlike large applications the perl build process opens and modifies a lot of files. Having the the AntiVirus scan each and every one slows build the process significantly. Worse, with PERLIO=stdio the build process fails with peculiar messages as the virus checker interacts badly with miniperl.exe writing configure files (it seems to either catch file part written and treat it as suspicious, or virus checker may have it &quot;locked&quot; in a way which inhibits miniperl updating it). The build does complete with<div class="spacer">

Some of the built-in functions do not act exactly as documented in perlfunc, and a few are not implemented at all.  To avoid surprises, particularly if you have had prior exposure to Perl in other operating environments or if you intend to write code that will be portable to other environments, see perlport for a reasonably definitive list of these differences.<div class="spacer">

Most &quot;socket()&quot; related calls are supported, but they may not behave as on Unix platforms.  See perlport for the full list.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Signal handling may not behave as on Unix platforms (where it doesn't exactly &quot;behave&quot;, either :).  For instance, calling &quot;die()&quot; or &quot;exit()&quot; from signal handlers will cause an exception, since most implementations of &quot;signal()&quot; on Windows are severely crippled. Thus, signals may work only for simple things like setting a flag variable in the handler.  Using signals under this port should currently be considered unsupported.<div class="spacer">
