<h1>NAME</h1> perlrecharclass - Perl Regular Expression Character Classes</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The top level documentation about Perl regular expressions is found in perlre.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This manual page discusses the syntax and use of character classes in Perl regular expressions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A character class is a way of denoting a set of characters in such a way that one character of the set is matched. It's important to remember that: matching a character class consumes exactly one character in the source string. (The source string is the string the regular expression is matched against.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are three types of character classes in Perl regular expressions: the dot, backslash sequences, and the form enclosed in square brackets.  Keep in mind, though, that often the term &quot;character class&quot; is used to mean just the bracketed form.  Certainly, most Perl documentation does that.<div class="subsection">
<h2>The dot</h2> The dot (or period), &quot;.&quot; is probably the most used, and certainly the most well-known character class. By default, a dot matches any character, except for the newline. The default can be changed to add matching the newline by using the  <i>single line</i> modifier: either for the entire regular expression with the &quot;/s&quot; modifier, or locally with &quot;(?s)&quot;.  (The experimental &quot;\N&quot; backslash sequence, described below, matches any character except newline without regard to the  <i>single line</i> modifier.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here are some examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /./       # Match<br/>
 &quot;.&quot;  =~  /./       # Match<br/>
 &quot;&quot;   =~  /./       # No match (dot has to match a character)<br/>
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /./       # No match (dot does not match a newline)<br/>
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /./s      # Match (global 'single line' modifier)<br/>
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /(?s:.)/  # Match (local 'single line' modifier)<br/>
 &quot;ab&quot; =~  /^.$/     # No match (dot matches one character)<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Backslash sequences</h2> A backslash sequence is a sequence of characters, the first one of which is a backslash.  Perl ascribes special meaning to many such sequences, and some of these are character classes.  That is, they match a single character each, provided that the character belongs to the specific set of characters defined by the sequence.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here's a list of the backslash sequences that are character classes.  They are discussed in more detail below.  (For the backslash sequences that aren't character classes, see perlrebackslash.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 \d             Match a decimal digit character.<br/>
 \D             Match a non-decimal-digit character.<br/>
 \w             Match a &quot;word&quot; character.<br/>
 \W             Match a non-&quot;word&quot; character.<br/>
 \s             Match a whitespace character.<br/>
 \S             Match a non-whitespace character.<br/>
 \h             Match a horizontal whitespace character.<br/>
 \H             Match a character that isn't horizontal whitespace.<br/>
 \v             Match a vertical whitespace character.<br/>
 \V             Match a character that isn't vertical whitespace.<br/>
 \N             Match a character that isn't a newline.  Experimental.<br/>
 \pP, \p{Prop}  Match a character that has the given Unicode property.<br/>
 \PP, \P{Prop}  Match a character that doesn't have the Unicode property<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Digits</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\d&quot; matches a single character considered to be a decimal <i>digit</i>. If the &quot;/a&quot; modifier in effect, it matches [0-9].  Otherwise, it matches anything that is matched by &quot;\p{Digit}&quot;, which includes [0-9]. (An unlikely possible exception is that under locale matching rules, the current locale might not have [0-9] matched by &quot;\d&quot;, and/or might match other characters whose code point is less than 256.  Such a locale definition would be in violation of the C language standard, but Perl doesn't currently assume anything in regard to this.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
What this means is that unless the &quot;/a&quot; modifier is in effect &quot;\d&quot; not only matches the digits '0' - '9', but also Arabic, Devanagari, and digits from other languages.  This may cause some confusion, and some security issues.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some digits that &quot;\d&quot; matches look like some of the [0-9] ones, but have different values.  For example, BENGALI DIGIT FOUR (U+09EA) looks very much like an ASCII DIGIT EIGHT (U+0038).  An application that is expecting only the ASCII digits might be misled, or if the match is &quot;\d+&quot;, the matched string might contain a mixture of digits from different writing systems that look like they signify a number different than they actually do. &quot; <i>num()</i>&quot; in Unicode::UCD can be used to safely calculate the value, returning &quot;undef&quot; if the input string contains such a mixture.<div class="spacer">
</div>
What &quot;\p{Digit}&quot; means (and hence &quot;\d&quot; except under the &quot;/a&quot; modifier) is &quot;\p{General_Category=Decimal_Number}&quot;, or synonymously, &quot;\p{General_Category=Digit}&quot;.  Starting with Unicode version 4.1, this is the same set of characters matched by &quot;\p{Numeric_Type=Decimal}&quot;. But Unicode also has a different property with a similar name, &quot;\p{Numeric_Type=Digit}&quot;, which matches a completely different set of characters.  These characters are things such as &quot;CIRCLED DIGIT ONE&quot; or subscripts, or are from writing systems that lack all ten digits.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The design intent is for &quot;\d&quot; to exactly match the set of characters that can safely be used with &quot;normal&quot; big-endian positional decimal syntax, where, for example 123 means one 'hundred', plus two 'tens', plus three 'ones'.  This positional notation does not necessarily apply to characters that match the other type of &quot;digit&quot;, &quot;\p{Numeric_Type=Digit}&quot;, and so &quot;\d&quot; doesn't match them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In Unicode 5.2, the Tamil digits (U+0BE6 - U+0BEF) can also legally be used in old-style Tamil numbers in which they would appear no more than one in a row, separated by characters that mean &quot;times 10&quot;, &quot;times 100&quot;, etc.  (See &lt;http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn21&gt;.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any character not matched by &quot;\d&quot; is matched by &quot;\D&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Word characters</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
A &quot;\w&quot; matches a single alphanumeric character (an alphabetic character, or a decimal digit) or a connecting punctuation character, such as an underscore (&quot;_&quot;).  It does not match a whole word.  To match a whole word, use &quot;\w+&quot;.  This isn't the same thing as matching an English word, but in the ASCII range it is the same as a string of Perl-identifier characters.<dl>

That is, it matches Thai letters, Greek letters, etc.  This includes connector punctuation (like the underscore) which connect two words together, or diacritics, such as a &quot;COMBINING TILDE&quot; and the modifier letters, which are generally used to add auxiliary markings to letters.</dd>

There are a number of security issues with the full Unicode list of word characters.  See &lt;http://unicode.org/reports/tr36&gt;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Also, for a somewhat finer-grained set of characters that are in programming language identifiers beyond the ASCII range, you may wish to instead use the more customized Unicode properties, &quot;ID_Start&quot;, ID_Continue&quot;, &quot;XID_Start&quot;, and &quot;XID_Continue&quot;.

Any character not matched by &quot;\s&quot; is matched by &quot;\S&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\h&quot; matches any character considered horizontal whitespace; this includes the space and tab characters and several others listed in the table below.  &quot;\H&quot; matches any character not considered horizontal whitespace.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\v&quot; matches any character considered vertical whitespace; this includes the carriage return and line feed characters (newline) plus several other characters, all listed in the table below. &quot;\V&quot; matches any character not considered vertical whitespace.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\R&quot; matches anything that can be considered a newline under Unicode rules. It's not a character class, as it can match a multi-character sequence. Therefore, it cannot be used inside a bracketed character class; use &quot;\v&quot; instead (vertical whitespace). Details are discussed in perlrebackslash.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that unlike &quot;\s&quot; (and &quot;\d&quot; and &quot;\w&quot;), &quot;\h&quot; and &quot;\v&quot; always match the same characters, without regard to other factors, such as whether the source string is in UTF-8 format.<div class="spacer">
</div>
One might think that &quot;\s&quot; is equivalent to &quot;[\h\v]&quot;. This is not true. For example, the vertical tab (&quot;\x0b&quot;) is not matched by &quot;\s&quot;, it is however considered vertical whitespace.<div class="spacer">

The following table is a complete listing of characters matched by &quot;\s&quot;, &quot;\h&quot; and &quot;\v&quot; as of Unicode 6.0.<div class="spacer">

The first column gives the code point of the character (in hex format), the second column gives the (Unicode) name. The third column indicates by which class(es) the character is matched (assuming no locale or EBCDIC code page is in effect that changes the &quot;\s&quot; matching).<div class="spacer">

</div>
<i>\N</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\N&quot; is new in 5.12, and is experimental.  It, like the dot, matches any character that is not a newline. The difference is that &quot;\N&quot; is not influenced by the  <i>single line</i> regular expression modifier (see &quot;The dot&quot; above).  Note that the form &quot;\N{...}&quot; may mean something completely different.  When the &quot;{...}&quot; is a quantifier, it means to match a non-newline character that many times.  For example, &quot;\N{3}&quot; means to match 3 non-newlines; &quot;\N{5,}&quot; means to match 5 or more non-newlines.  But if &quot;{...}&quot; is not a legal quantifier, it is presumed to be a named character.  See charnames for those.  For example, none of &quot;\N{COLON}&quot;, &quot;\N{4F}&quot;, and &quot;\N{F4}&quot; contain legal quantifiers, so Perl will try to find characters whose names are respectively &quot;COLON&quot;, &quot;4F&quot;, and &quot;F4&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Unicode Properties</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\pP&quot; and &quot;\p{Prop}&quot; are character classes to match characters that fit given Unicode properties.  One letter property names can be used in the &quot;\pP&quot; form, with the property name following the &quot;\p&quot;, otherwise, braces are required. When using braces, there is a single form, which is just the property name enclosed in the braces, and a compound form which looks like &quot;\p{name=value}&quot;, which means to match if the property &quot;name&quot; for the character has that particular &quot;value&quot;. For instance, a match for a number can be written as &quot;/\pN/&quot; or as &quot;/\p{Number}/&quot;, or as &quot;/\p{Number=True}/&quot;. Lowercase letters are matched by the property  <i>Lowercase_Letter</i> which has as short form  <i>Ll</i>. They need the braces, so are written as &quot;/\p{Ll}/&quot; or &quot;/\p{Lowercase_Letter}/&quot;, or &quot;/\p{General_Category=Lowercase_Letter}/&quot; (the underscores are optional). &quot;/\pLl/&quot; is valid, but means something different. It matches a two character string: a letter (Unicode property &quot;\pL&quot;), followed by a lowercase &quot;l&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If neither the &quot;/a&quot; modifier nor locale rules are in effect, the use of a Unicode property will force the regular expression into using Unicode rules.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that almost all properties are immune to case-insensitive matching. That is, adding a &quot;/i&quot; regular expression modifier does not change what they match.  There are two sets that are affected.  The first set is &quot;Uppercase_Letter&quot;, &quot;Lowercase_Letter&quot;, and &quot;Titlecase_Letter&quot;, all of which match &quot;Cased_Letter&quot; under &quot;/i&quot; matching. The second set is &quot;Uppercase&quot;, &quot;Lowercase&quot;, and &quot;Titlecase&quot;, all of which match &quot;Cased&quot; under &quot;/i&quot; matching. (The difference between these sets is that some things, such as Roman Numerals, come in both upper and lower case so they are &quot;Cased&quot;, but aren't considered to be letters, so they aren't &quot;Cased_Letter&quot;s. They're actually &quot;Letter_Number&quot;s.) This set also includes its subsets &quot;PosixUpper&quot; and &quot;PosixLower&quot;, both of which under &quot;/i&quot; matching match &quot;PosixAlpha&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For more details on Unicode properties, see &quot;Unicode Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode; for a complete list of possible properties, see &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops, which notes all forms that have &quot;/i&quot; differences. It is also possible to define your own properties. This is discussed in &quot;User-Defined Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\w/      # Match, &quot;a&quot; is a 'word' character.<br/>
 &quot;7&quot;  =~  /\w/      # Match, &quot;7&quot; is a 'word' character as well.<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\d/      # No match, &quot;a&quot; isn't a digit.<br/>
 &quot;7&quot;  =~  /\d/      # Match, &quot;7&quot; is a digit.<br/>
 &quot; &quot;  =~  /\s/      # Match, a space is whitespace.<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\D/      # Match, &quot;a&quot; is a non-digit.<br/>
 &quot;7&quot;  =~  /\D/      # No match, &quot;7&quot; is not a non-digit.<br/>
 &quot; &quot;  =~  /\S/      # No match, a space is not non-whitespace.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot; &quot;  =~  /\h/      # Match, space is horizontal whitespace.<br/>
 &quot; &quot;  =~  /\v/      # No match, space is not vertical whitespace.<br/>
 &quot;\r&quot; =~  /\v/      # Match, a return is vertical whitespace.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\pL/     # Match, &quot;a&quot; is a letter.<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\p{Lu}/  # No match, /\p{Lu}/ matches upper case letters.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;\x{0e0b}&quot; =~ /\p{Thai}/  # Match, \x{0e0b} is the character<br/>
                           # 'THAI CHARACTER SO SO', and that's in<br/>
                           # Thai Unicode class.<br/>
 &quot;a&quot;  =~  /\P{Lao}/ # Match, as &quot;a&quot; is not a Laotian character.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is worth emphasizing that &quot;\d&quot;, &quot;\w&quot;, etc, match single characters, not complete numbers or words. To match a number (that consists of digits), use &quot;\d+&quot;; to match a word, use &quot;\w+&quot;.  But be aware of the security considerations in doing so, as mentioned above.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Bracketed Character Classes</h2> The third form of character class you can use in Perl regular expressions is the bracketed character class.  In its simplest form, it lists the characters that may be matched, surrounded by square brackets, like this: &quot;[aeiou]&quot;. This matches one of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot;.  Like the other character classes, exactly one character is matched.* To match a longer string consisting of characters mentioned in the character class, follow the character class with a quantifier.  For instance, &quot;[aeiou]+&quot; matches one or more lowercase English vowels.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Repeating a character in a character class has no effect; it's considered to be in the set only once.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;e&quot;  =~  /[aeiou]/        # Match, as &quot;e&quot; is listed in the class.<br/>
 &quot;p&quot;  =~  /[aeiou]/        # No match, &quot;p&quot; is not listed in the class.<br/>
 &quot;ae&quot; =~  /^[aeiou]$/      # No match, a character class only matches<br/>
                           # a single character.<br/>
 &quot;ae&quot; =~  /^[aeiou]+$/     # Match, due to the quantifier.<br/>
<br/>
 -------<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
* There is an exception to a bracketed character class matching only a single character.  When the class is to match caselessely under &quot;/i&quot; matching rules, and a character inside the class matches a multiple-character sequence caselessly under Unicode rules, the class (when not inverted) will also match that sequence.  For example, Unicode says that the letter &quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S&quot; should match the sequence &quot;ss&quot; under &quot;/i&quot; rules.  Thus,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 'ss' =~ /\A\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}\z/i             # Matches<br/>
 'ss' =~ /\A[aeioust\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}]\z/i    # Matches<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Special Characters Inside a Bracketed Character Class</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Most characters that are meta characters in regular expressions (that is, characters that carry a special meaning like &quot;.&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, or &quot;(&quot;) lose their special meaning and can be used inside a character class without the need to escape them. For instance, &quot;[()]&quot; matches either an opening parenthesis, or a closing parenthesis, and the parens inside the character class don't group or capture.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Characters that may carry a special meaning inside a character class are: &quot;\&quot;, &quot;^&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;, and are discussed below. They can be escaped with a backslash, although this is sometimes not needed, in which case the backslash may be omitted.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The sequence &quot;\b&quot; is special inside a bracketed character class. While outside the character class, &quot;\b&quot; is an assertion indicating a point that does not have either two word characters or two non-word characters on either side, inside a bracketed character class, &quot;\b&quot; matches a backspace character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The sequences &quot;\a&quot;, &quot;\c&quot;, &quot;\e&quot;, &quot;\f&quot;, &quot;\n&quot;, &quot;\N{ <i>NAME</i>}&quot;, &quot;\N{U+ <i>hex char</i>}&quot;, &quot;\r&quot;, &quot;\t&quot;, and &quot;\x&quot; are also special and have the same meanings as they do outside a bracketed character class.  (However, inside a bracketed character class, if &quot;\N{ <i>NAME</i>}&quot; expands to a sequence of characters, only the first one in the sequence is used, with a warning.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Also, a backslash followed by two or three octal digits is considered an octal number.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A &quot;[&quot; is not special inside a character class, unless it's the start of a POSIX character class (see &quot;POSIX Character Classes&quot; below). It normally does not need escaping.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A &quot;]&quot; is normally either the end of a POSIX character class (see &quot;POSIX Character Classes&quot; below), or it signals the end of the bracketed character class.  If you want to include a &quot;]&quot; in the set of characters, you must generally escape it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, if the &quot;]&quot; is the <i>first</i> (or the second if the first character is a caret) character of a bracketed character class, it does not denote the end of the class (as you cannot have an empty class) and is considered part of the set of characters that can be matched without escaping.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;+&quot;   =~ /[+?*]/     #  Match, &quot;+&quot; in a character class is not special.<br/>
 &quot;\cH&quot; =~ /[\b]/      #  Match, \b inside in a character class<br/>
                      #  is equivalent to a backspace.<br/>
 &quot;]&quot;   =~ /[][]/      #  Match, as the character class contains.<br/>
                      #  both [ and ].<br/>
 &quot;[]&quot;  =~ /[[]]/      #  Match, the pattern contains a character class<br/>
                      #  containing just ], and the character class is<br/>
                      #  followed by a ].<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Character Ranges</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
It is not uncommon to want to match a range of characters. Luckily, instead of listing all characters in the range, one may use the hyphen (&quot;-&quot;). If inside a bracketed character class you have two characters separated by a hyphen, it's treated as if all characters between the two were in the class. For instance, &quot;[0-9]&quot; matches any ASCII digit, and &quot;[a-m]&quot; matches any lowercase letter from the first half of the old ASCII alphabet.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that the two characters on either side of the hyphen are not necessarily both letters or both digits. Any character is possible, although not advisable.  &quot;['-?]&quot; contains a range of characters, but most people will not know which characters that means.  Furthermore, such ranges may lead to portability problems if the code has to run on a platform that uses a different character set, such as EBCDIC.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a hyphen in a character class cannot syntactically be part of a range, for instance because it is the first or the last character of the character class, or if it immediately follows a range, the hyphen isn't special, and so is considered a character to be matched literally.  If you want a hyphen in your set of characters to be matched and its position in the class is such that it could be considered part of a range, you must escape that hyphen with a backslash.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 [a-z]       #  Matches a character that is a lower case ASCII letter.<br/>
 [a-fz]      #  Matches any letter between 'a' and 'f' (inclusive) or<br/>
             #  the letter 'z'.<br/>
 [-z]        #  Matches either a hyphen ('-') or the letter 'z'.<br/>
 [a-f-m]     #  Matches any letter between 'a' and 'f' (inclusive), the<br/>
             #  hyphen ('-'), or the letter 'm'.<br/>
 ['-?]       #  Matches any of the characters  '()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?<br/>
             #  (But not on an EBCDIC platform).<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Negation</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
It is also possible to instead list the characters you do not want to match. You can do so by using a caret (&quot;^&quot;) as the first character in the character class. For instance, &quot;[^a-z]&quot; matches any character that is not a lowercase ASCII letter, which therefore includes almost a hundred thousand Unicode letters.  The class is said to be &quot;negated&quot; or &quot;inverted&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This syntax make the caret a special character inside a bracketed character class, but only if it is the first character of the class. So if you want the caret as one of the characters to match, either escape the caret or else not list it first.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In inverted bracketed character classes, Perl ignores the Unicode rules that normally say that a given character matches a sequence of multiple characters under caseless &quot;/i&quot; matching, which otherwise could be highly confusing:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;ss&quot; =~ /^[^\xDF]+$/ui;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This should match any sequences of characters that aren't &quot;\xDF&quot; nor what &quot;\xDF&quot; matches under &quot;/i&quot;.  &quot;s&quot; isn't &quot;\xDF&quot;, but Unicode says that &quot;ss&quot; is what &quot;\xDF&quot; matches under &quot;/i&quot;.  So which one &quot;wins&quot;? Do you fail the match because the string has &quot;ss&quot; or accept it because it has an &quot;s&quot; followed by another &quot;s&quot;?<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 &quot;e&quot;  =~  /[^aeiou]/   #  No match, the 'e' is listed.<br/>
 &quot;x&quot;  =~  /[^aeiou]/   #  Match, as 'x' isn't a lowercase vowel.<br/>
 &quot;^&quot;  =~  /[^^]/       #  No match, matches anything that isn't a caret.<br/>
 &quot;^&quot;  =~  /[x^]/       #  Match, caret is not special here.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Backslash Sequences</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
You can put any backslash sequence character class (with the exception of &quot;\N&quot; and &quot;\R&quot;) inside a bracketed character class, and it will act just as if you had put all characters matched by the backslash sequence inside the character class. For instance, &quot;[a-f\d]&quot; matches any decimal digit, or any of the lowercase letters between 'a' and 'f' inclusive.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\N&quot; within a bracketed character class must be of the forms &quot;\N{<i>name</i>}&quot; or &quot;\N{U+ <i>hex char</i>}&quot;, and NOT be the form that matches non-newlines, for the same reason that a dot &quot;.&quot; inside a bracketed character class loses its special meaning: it matches nearly anything, which generally isn't what you want to happen.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /[\p{Thai}\d]/     # Matches a character that is either a Thai<br/>
                    # character, or a digit.<br/>
 /[^\p{Arabic}()]/  # Matches a character that is neither an Arabic<br/>
                    # character, nor a parenthesis.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Backslash sequence character classes cannot form one of the endpoints of a range.  Thus, you can't say:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 /[\p{Thai}-\d]/     # Wrong!<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>POSIX Character Classes</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
POSIX character classes have the form &quot;[:class:]&quot;, where <i>class</i> is name, and the &quot;[:&quot; and &quot;:]&quot; delimiters. POSIX character classes only appear  <i>inside</i> bracketed character classes, and are a convenient and descriptive way of listing a group of characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Be careful about the syntax,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 # Correct:<br/>
 $string =~ /[[:alpha:]]/<br/>
<br/>
 # Incorrect (will warn):<br/>
 $string =~ /[:alpha:]/<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The latter pattern would be a character class consisting of a colon, and the letters &quot;a&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;h&quot;. POSIX character classes can be part of a larger bracketed character class. For example,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 [01[:alpha:]%]<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
is valid and matches '0', '1', any alphabetic character, and the percent sign.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl recognizes the following POSIX character classes:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 alpha  Any alphabetical character (&quot;[A-Za-z]&quot;).<br/>
 alnum  Any alphanumeric character. (&quot;[A-Za-z0-9]&quot;)<br/>
 ascii  Any character in the ASCII character set.<br/>
 blank  A GNU extension, equal to a space or a horizontal tab (&quot;\t&quot;).<br/>
 cntrl  Any control character.  See Note [2] below.<br/>
 digit  Any decimal digit (&quot;[0-9]&quot;), equivalent to &quot;\d&quot;.<br/>
 graph  Any printable character, excluding a space.  See Note [3] below.<br/>
 lower  Any lowercase character (&quot;[a-z]&quot;).<br/>
 print  Any printable character, including a space.  See Note [4] below.<br/>
 punct  Any graphical character excluding &quot;word&quot; characters.  Note [5].<br/>
 space  Any whitespace character. &quot;\s&quot; plus the vertical tab (&quot;\cK&quot;).<br/>
 upper  Any uppercase character (&quot;[A-Z]&quot;).<br/>
 word   A Perl extension (&quot;[A-Za-z0-9_]&quot;), equivalent to &quot;\w&quot;.<br/>
 xdigit Any hexadecimal digit (&quot;[0-9a-fA-F]&quot;).<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Most POSIX character classes have two Unicode-style &quot;\p&quot; property counterparts.  (They are not official Unicode properties, but Perl extensions derived from official Unicode properties.)  The table below shows the relation between POSIX character classes and these counterparts.<div class="spacer">
</div>
One counterpart, in the column labelled &quot;ASCII-range Unicode&quot; in the table, matches only characters in the ASCII character set.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The other counterpart, in the column labelled &quot;Full-range Unicode&quot;, matches any appropriate characters in the full Unicode character set.  For example, &quot;\p{Alpha}&quot; matches not just the ASCII alphabetic characters, but any character in the entire Unicode character set considered alphabetic. The column labelled &quot;backslash sequence&quot; is a (short) synonym for the Full-range Unicode form.<div class="spacer">
</div>
(Each of the counterparts has various synonyms as well. &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops lists all synonyms, plus all characters matched by each ASCII-range property. For example, &quot;\p{AHex}&quot; is a synonym for &quot;\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit}&quot;, and any &quot;\p&quot; property name can be prefixed with &quot;Is&quot; such as &quot;\p{IsAlpha}&quot;.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Both the &quot;\p&quot; counterparts always assume Unicode rules are in effect. On ASCII platforms, this means they assume that the code points from 128 to 255 are Latin-1, and that means that using them under locale rules is unwise unless the locale is guaranteed to be Latin-1 or UTF-8.  In contrast, the POSIX character classes are useful under locale rules.  They are affected by the actual rules in effect, as follows:<dl>
<dt>
If the &quot;/a&quot; modifier, is in effect ...</dt>
<dd>
Each of the POSIX classes matches exactly the same as their ASCII-range counterparts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
otherwise ...</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
For code points above 255 ...</dt>
<dd>
The POSIX class matches the same as its Full-range counterpart.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
For code points below 256 ...</dt>
<dd>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
if locale rules are in effect ...</dt>
<dd>
The POSIX class matches according to the locale.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
if Unicode rules are in effect or if on an EBCDIC platform ...</dt>
<dd>
The POSIX class matches the same as the Full-range counterpart.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
otherwise ...</dt>
<dd>
The POSIX class matches the same as the ASCII range counterpart.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Which rules apply are determined as described in &quot;Which character set modifier is in effect?&quot; in perlre.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is proposed to change this behavior in a future release of Perl so that whether or not Unicode rules are in effect would not change the behavior:  Outside of locale or an EBCDIC code page, the POSIX classes would behave like their ASCII-range counterparts.

Control characters don't produce output as such, but instead usually control the terminal somehow: for example, newline and backspace are control characters. In the ASCII range, characters whose code points are between 0 and 31 inclusive, plus 127 (&quot;DEL&quot;) are control characters.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On EBCDIC platforms, it is likely that the code page will define &quot;[[:cntrl:]]&quot; to be the EBCDIC equivalents of the ASCII controls, plus the controls that in Unicode have code pointss from 128 through 159.</dd>

&quot;\p{PosixPunct}&quot; and &quot;[[:punct:]]&quot; in the ASCII range match all non-controls, non-alphanumeric, non-space characters: &quot;[-!&quot;#$%&amp;'()*+,./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\\]^_`{|}~]&quot; (although if a locale is in effect, it could alter the behavior of &quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The similarly named property, &quot;\p{Punct}&quot;, matches a somewhat different set in the ASCII range, namely &quot;[-!&quot;#%&amp;'()*,./:;?@[\\\]_{}]&quot;.  That is, it is missing &quot;[$+&lt;=&gt;^`|~]&quot;. This is because Unicode splits what POSIX considers to be punctuation into two categories, Punctuation and Symbols.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;\p{XPosixPunct}&quot; and (in Unicode mode) &quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;, match what &quot;\p{PosixPunct}&quot; matches in the ASCII range, plus what &quot;\p{Punct}&quot; matches.  This is different than strictly matching according to &quot;\p{Punct}&quot;.  Another way to say it is that if Unicode rules are in effect, &quot;[[:punct:]]&quot; matches all characters that Unicode considers punctuation, plus all ASCII-range characters that Unicode considers symbols.</dd>

Negation of POSIX character classes<div class="spacer">
