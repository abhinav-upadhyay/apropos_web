<h1>Internal Changes</h1><dl>

The compiled representation of formats is now stored via the mg_ptr of their PERL_MAGIC_fm. Previously it was stored in the string buffer, beyond  <i>SvLEN()</i>, the regular end of the string. <i>SvCOMPILED()</i> and SvCOMPILED_{on,off}() now exist solely for compatibility for XS code. The first is always 0, the other two now no-ops.</dd>

<h1>Bug Fixes</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A bug has been fixed that would cause a &quot;Use of freed value in iteration&quot; error if the next two hash elements that would be iterated over are deleted. [perl #85026]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Passing the same constant subroutine to both &quot;index&quot; and &quot;formline&quot; no longer causes one or the other to fail. [perl #89218]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
5.14.0 introduced some memory leaks in regular expression character classes such as &quot;[\w\s]&quot;, which have now been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
An edge case in regular expression matching could potentially loop. This happened only under &quot;/i&quot; in bracketed character classes that have characters with multi-character folds, and the target string to match against includes the first portion of the fold, followed by another character that has a multi-character fold that begins with the remaining portion of the fold, plus some more.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 &quot;s\N{U+DF}&quot; =~ /[\x{DF}foo]/i<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
is one such case.  &quot;\xDF&quot; folds to &quot;ss&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Several Unicode case-folding bugs have been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The new (in 5.14.0) regular expression modifier &quot;/a&quot; when repeated like &quot;/aa&quot; forbids the characters outside the ASCII range that match characters inside that range from matching under &quot;/i&quot;.  This did not work under some circumstances, all involving alternation, such as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
 &quot;\N{KELVIN SIGN}&quot; =~ /k|foo/iaa;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
succeeded inappropriately.  This is now fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have been read from when parsing a here document.</dd>
</dl>

<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</div>
