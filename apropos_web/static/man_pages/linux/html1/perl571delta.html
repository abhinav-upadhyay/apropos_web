<h1>NAME</h1> perl571delta - what's new for perl v5.7.1</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.7.0 release and the 5.7.1 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
(To view the differences between the 5.6.0 release and the 5.7.0 release, see perl570delta.)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Security Vulnerability Closed</h1> (This change was already made in 5.7.0 but bears repeating here.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
A potential security vulnerability in the optional suidperl component of Perl was identified in August 2000.  suidperl is neither built nor installed by default.  As of April 2001 the only known vulnerable platform is Linux, most likely all Linux distributions.  CERT and various vendors and distributors have been alerted about the vulnerability. See http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/sperl-2000-08-05.txt for more information.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The problem was caused by Perl trying to report a suspected security exploit attempt using an external program, /bin/mail.  On Linux platforms the /bin/mail program had an undocumented feature which when combined with suidperl gave access to a root shell, resulting in a serious compromise instead of reporting the exploit attempt.  If you don't have /bin/mail, or if you have 'safe setuid scripts', or if suidperl is not installed, you are safe.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The exploit attempt reporting feature has been completely removed from all the Perl 5.7 releases (and will be gone also from the maintenance release 5.6.1), so that particular vulnerability isn't there anymore. However, further security vulnerabilities are, unfortunately, always possible.  The suidperl code is being reviewed and if deemed too risky to continue to be supported, it may be completely removed from future releases.  In any case, suidperl should only be used by security experts who know exactly what they are doing and why they are using suidperl instead of some other solution such as sudo ( see http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ ).</div>

<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Although &quot;you shouldn't do that&quot;, it was possible to write code that depends on Perl's hashed key order (Data::Dumper does this).  The new algorithm &quot;One-at-a-Time&quot; produces a different hashed key order. More details are in &quot;Performance Enhancements&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The list of filenames from <i>glob()</i> (or &lt;...&gt;) is now by default sorted alphabetically to be csh-compliant.  ( <i>bsd_glob()</i> does still sort platform natively, ASCII or EBCDIC, unless GLOB_ALPHASORT is specified.)</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>AUTOLOAD Is Now Lvaluable</h2> AUTOLOAD is now lvaluable, meaning that you can add the :lvalue attribute to AUTOLOAD subroutines and you can assign to the AUTOLOAD return value.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>PerlIO is Now The Default</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
IO is now by default done via PerlIO rather than system's &quot;stdio&quot;. PerlIO allows &quot;layers&quot; to be &quot;pushed&quot; onto a file handle to alter the handle's behaviour.  Layers can be specified at open time via 3-arg form of open:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   open($fh,'&gt;:crlf :utf8', $path) || ...<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
or on already opened handles via extended &quot;binmode&quot;:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   binmode($fh,':encoding(iso-8859-7)');<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The built-in layers are: unix (low level read/write), stdio (as in previous Perls), perlio (re-implementation of stdio buffering in a portable manner), crlf (does CRLF &lt;=&gt; &quot;\n&quot; translation as on Win32, but available on any platform).  A mmap layer may be available if platform supports it (mostly Unixes).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Layers to be applied by default may be specified via the 'open' pragma.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;Installation and Configuration Improvements&quot; for the effects of PerlIO on your architecture name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
File handles can be marked as accepting Perl's internal encoding of Unicode (UTF-8 or UTF-EBCDIC depending on platform) by a pseudo layer &quot;:utf8&quot; :<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   open($fh,&quot;&gt;:utf8&quot;,&quot;Uni.txt&quot;);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note for EBCDIC users: the pseudo layer &quot;:utf8&quot; is erroneously named for you since it's not UTF-8 what you will be getting but instead UTF-EBCDIC.  See perlunicode, utf8, and http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr16/ for more information. In future releases this naming may change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
File handles can translate character encodings from/to Perl's internal Unicode form on read/write via the &quot;: <i>encoding()</i>&quot; layer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
File handles can be opened to &quot;in memory&quot; files held in Perl scalars via:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   open($fh,'&gt;', \$variable) || ...<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Anonymous temporary files are available without need to 'use FileHandle' or other module via<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   open($fh,&quot;+&gt;&quot;, undef) || ...<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
That is a literal undef, not an undefined value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The list form of &quot;open&quot; is now implemented for pipes (at least on Unix):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   open($fh,&quot;-|&quot;, 'cat', '/etc/motd')<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
creates a pipe, and runs the equivalent of exec('cat', '/etc/motd') in the child process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The following builtin functions are now overridable: <i>chop()</i>, <i>chomp()</i>,  <i>each()</i>, <i>keys()</i>, <i>pop()</i>, <i>push()</i>, <i>shift()</i>, <i>splice()</i>, <i>unshift()</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Formats now support zero-padded decimal fields.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl now tries internally to use integer values in numeric conversions and basic arithmetics (+ - * /) if the arguments are integers, and tries also to keep the results stored internally as integers. This change leads into often slightly faster and always less lossy arithmetics. (Previously Perl always preferred floating point numbers in its math.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The <i>printf()</i> and <i>sprintf()</i> now support parameter reordering using the &quot;%\d+\$&quot; and &quot;*\d+\$&quot; syntaxes.  For example<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    print &quot;%2\$s %1\$s\n&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
will print &quot;bar foo\n&quot;; This feature helps in writing internationalised software.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Unicode in general should be now much more usable.  Unicode can be used in hash keys, Unicode in regular expressions should work now, Unicode in tr/// should work now (though tr/// seems to be a particularly tricky to get right, so you have been warned)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The Unicode Character Database coming with Perl has been upgraded to Unicode 3.1.  For more information, see http://www.unicode.org/ , and http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr27/<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For developers interested in enhancing Perl's Unicode capabilities: almost all the UCD files are included with the Perl distribution in the lib/unicode subdirectory.  The most notable omission, for space considerations, is the Unihan database.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The Unicode character classes \p{Blank} and \p{SpacePerl} have been added.  &quot;Blank&quot; is like C  <i>isblank()</i>, that is, it contains only &quot;horizontal whitespace&quot; (the space character is, the newline isn't), and the &quot;SpacePerl&quot; is the Unicode equivalent of &quot;\s&quot; (\p{Space} isn't, since that includes the vertical tabulator character, whereas &quot;\s&quot; doesn't.)</dd>

Hashes now use Bob Jenkins &quot;One-at-a-Time&quot; hashing key algorithm ( http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html ).  This algorithm is reasonably fast while producing a much better spread of values than the old hashing algorithm (originally by Chris Torek, later tweaked by Ilya Zakharevich).  Hash values output from the algorithm on a hash of all 3-char printable ASCII keys comes much closer to passing the DIEHARD random number generation tests.

<h2>README.bs2000</h2> Documentation on compiling Perl on the POSIX-BC platform (an EBCDIC mainframe environment) has been added.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This was formerly known as README.posix-bc but the name was considered to be too confusing (it has nothing to do with the POSIX module or the POSIX standard).  On install README.bs2000 will be installed as perlbs2000.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>README.macos</h2> In perl 5.7.1 (and in the 5.6.1) the MacPerl sources have been synchronised with the standard Perl sources.  To compile MacPerl some additional steps are required, and this file documents those steps.  On install README.macos will be installed as perlmacos.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>README.mpeix</h2> The README.mpeix has been podified, which means that this information about compiling and using Perl on the MPE/iX miniframe platform will be installed as perlmpeix.</div>

<h1>Installation and Configuration Improvements</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Because PerlIO is now the default on most platforms, &quot;-perlio&quot; doesn't get appended to the $Config{archname} (also known as $^O) anymore. Instead, if you explicitly choose not to use perlio (Configure command line option -Uuseperlio), you will get &quot;-stdio&quot; appended.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Another change related to the architecture name is that &quot;-64all&quot; (-Duse64bitall, or &quot;maximally 64-bit&quot;) is appended only if your pointers are 64 bits wide.  (To be exact, the use64bitall is ignored.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
APPLLIB_EXP, a less-know configuration-time definition, has been documented.  It can be used to prepend site-specific directories to Perl's default search path (@INC), see INSTALL for information.</dd>

EBCDIC platforms (z/OS, also known as OS/390, POSIX-BC, and VM/ESA) have been regained.  Many test suite tests still fail and the co-existence of Unicode and EBCDIC isn't quite settled, but the situation is much better than with Perl 5.6.  See perlos390, perlbs2000 (for POSIX-BC), and perlvmesa for more information.</dd>

If your file system supports symbolic links you can build Perl outside of the source directory by<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        mkdir perl/build/directory<br/>
        cd perl/build/directory<br/>
        sh /path/to/perl/source/Configure -Dmksymlinks ...<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This will create in perl/build/directory a tree of symbolic links pointing to files in /path/to/perl/source.  The original files are left unaffected.  After Configure has finished you can just say<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        make all test<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Perl now uses system malloc instead of Perl malloc on all 64-bit platforms, and even in some not-always-64-bit platforms like AIX, IRIX, and Solaris.  This change breaks backward compatibility but Perl's malloc has problems with large address spaces and also the speed of vendors' malloc is generally better in large address space machines (Perl's malloc is mostly tuned for space).</dd>

<div class="section">
<h1>New Tests</h1> Many new tests have been added.  The most notable is probably the lib/1_compile: it is very notable because running it takes quite a long time. It test compiles all the Perl modules in the distribution. Please be patient.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Known Problems</h1> Note that unlike other sections in this document (which describe changes since 5.7.0) this section is cumulative containing known problems for all the 5.7 releases.<div class="subsection">
<h2>AIX vac 5.0.0.0 May Produce Buggy Code For Perl</h2> The AIX C compiler vac version 5.0.0.0 may produce buggy code, resulting in few random tests failing, but when the failing tests are run by hand, they succeed.  We suggest upgrading to at least vac version 5.0.1.0, that has been known to compile Perl correctly. &quot;lslpp -L|grep vac.C&quot; will tell you the vac version.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>lib/ftmp-security tests warn 'system possibly insecure'</h2> Don't panic.  Read INSTALL 'make test' section instead.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>lib/io_multihomed Fails In LP64-Configured HP-UX</h2> The lib/io_multihomed test may hang in HP-UX if Perl has been configured to be 64-bit. Because other 64-bit platforms do not hang in this test, HP-UX is suspect. All other tests pass in 64-bit HP-UX. The test attempts to create and connect to &quot;multihomed&quot; sockets (sockets which have multiple IP addresses).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Test lib/posix Subtest 9 Fails In LP64-Configured HP-UX</h2> If perl is configured with -Duse64bitall, the successful result of the subtest 10 of lib/posix may arrive before the successful result of the subtest 9, which confuses the test harness so much that it thinks the subtest 9 failed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>lib/b test 19</h2> The test fails on various platforms (PA64 and IA64 are known), but the exact cause is still being investigated.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Linux With Sfio Fails op/misc Test 48</h2> No known fix.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>sigaction test 13 in VMS</h2> The test is known to fail; whether it's because of VMS of because of faulty test is not known.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>sprintf tests 129 and 130</h2> The op/sprintf tests 129 and 130 are known to fail on some platforms. Examples include any platform using sfio, and Compaq/Tandem's NonStop-UX. The failing platforms do not comply with the ANSI C Standard, line 19ff on page 134 of ANSI X3.159 1989 to be exact.  (They produce something else than &quot;1&quot; and &quot;-1&quot; when formatting 0.6 and -0.6 using the printf format &quot;%.0f&quot;, most often they produce &quot;0&quot; and &quot;-0&quot;.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Failure of Thread tests</h2> The subtests 19 and 20 of lib/thr5005.t test are known to fail due to fundamental problems in the 5.005 threading implementation. These are not new failures--Perl 5.005_0x has the same bugs, but didn't have these tests. (Note that support for 5.005-style threading remains experimental.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Localising a Tied Variable Leaks Memory</h2><br/>
    use Tie::Hash;<br/>
    tie my %tie_hash =&gt; 'Tie::StdHash';<br/>
<br/>
    ...<br/>
<br/>
    local($tie_hash{Foo}) = 1; # leaks<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Code like the above is known to leak memory every time the <i>local()</i> is executed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Self-tying of Arrays and Hashes Is Forbidden</h2> Self-tying of arrays and hashes is broken in rather deep and hard-to-fix ways.  As a stop-gap measure to avoid people from getting frustrated at the mysterious results (core dumps, most often) it is for now forbidden (you will get a fatal error even from an attempt).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles</h2> Some extensions like mod_perl are known to have issues with `largefiles', a change brought by Perl 5.6.0 in which file offsets default to 64 bits wide, where supported.  Modules may fail to compile at all or compile and work incorrectly.  Currently there is no good solution for the problem, but Configure now provides appropriate non-largefile ccflags, ldflags, libswanted, and libs in the %Config hash (e.g., $Config{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the extensions that are having problems can try configuring themselves without the largefileness.  This is admittedly not a clean solution, and the solution may not even work at all.  One potential failure is whether one can (or, if one can, whether it's a good idea) link together at all binaries with different ideas about file offsets, all this is platform-dependent.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The Compiler Suite Is Still Experimental</h2> The compiler suite is slowly getting better but is nowhere near working order yet.</div>
