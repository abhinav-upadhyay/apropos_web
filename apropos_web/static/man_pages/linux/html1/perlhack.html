<h1>NAME</h1> perlhack - How to hack on Perl</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document explains how Perl development works. It includes details about the Perl 5 Porters email list, the Perl repository, the Perlbug bug tracker, patch guidelines, and commentary on Perl development philosophy.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SUPER QUICK PATCH GUIDE</h1> If you just want to submit a single small patch like a pod fix, a test for a bug, comment fixes, etc., it's easy! Here's how:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Check out the source repository<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The perl source is in a git repository. You can clone the repository with the following command:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  % git clone git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git perl<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Make your change<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Hack, hack, hack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Test your change<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can run all the tests with the following commands:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  % ./Configure -des -Dusedevel<br/>
  % make test<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Keep hacking until the tests pass.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Commit your change<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Committing your work will save the change <i>on your local system</i>:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  % git commit -a -m 'Commit message goes here'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Make sure the commit message describes your change in a single sentence. For example, &quot;Fixed spelling errors in perlhack.pod&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Send your change to perlbug<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The next step is to submit your patch to the Perl core ticket system via email.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Assuming your patch consists of a single git commit, you can send it to perlbug with this command line:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  % git format-patch HEAD^1..HEAD<br/>
  % perlbug -s '[PATCH] `git log --pretty=format:%s HEAD^1..HEAD`' -f 0001-*.patch<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The perlbug program will ask you a few questions about your email address and the patch you're submitting. Once you've answered them you can submit your patch.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Thank you<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The porters appreciate the time you spent helping to make Perl better. Thank you!</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUG REPORTING</h1> If you want to report a bug in Perl, you must use the  <i>perlbug</i> command line tool. This tool will ensure that your bug report includes all the relevant system and configuration information.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To browse existing Perl bugs and patches, you can use the web interface at &lt;http://rt.perl.org/&gt;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Please check the archive of the perl5-porters list (see below) and/or the bug tracking system before submitting a bug report. Often, you'll find that the bug has been reported already.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can log in to the bug tracking system and comment on existing bug reports. If you have additional information regarding an existing bug, please add it. This will help the porters fix the bug.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>PERL 5 PORTERS</h1> The perl5-porters (p5p) mailing list is where the Perl standard distribution is maintained and developed. The people who maintain Perl are also referred to as the &quot;Perl 5 Porters&quot;, or just the &quot;porters&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A searchable archive of the list is available at http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/ &lt;http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/&gt;. There is also another archive at http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/ &lt;http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/&gt;.<div class="subsection">
<h2>perl-changes mailing list</h2> The perl5-changes mailing list receives a copy of each patch that gets submitted to the maintenance and development branches of the perl repository. See http://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-changes.html &lt;http://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-changes.html&gt; for subscription and archive information.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>GETTING THE PERL SOURCE</h1> All of Perl's source code is kept centrally in a Git repository at  <i>perl5.git.perl.org</i>. The repository contains many Perl revisions from Perl 1 onwards and all the revisions from Perforce, the previous version control system.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For much more detail on using git with the Perl repository, please see perlgit.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Read access via Git</h2> You will need a copy of Git for your computer. You can fetch a copy of the repository using the git protocol:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git clone git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git perl<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This clones the repository and makes a local copy in the <i>perl</i> directory.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you cannot use the git protocol for firewall reasons, you can also clone via http, though this is much slower:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git clone http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git perl<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Read access via the web</h2> You may access the repository over the web. This allows you to browse the tree, see recent commits, subscribe to RSS feeds for the changes, search for particular commits and more. You may access it at &lt;http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git&gt;. A mirror of the repository is found at &lt;http://github.com/mirrors/perl&gt;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Read access via rsync</h2> You can also choose to use rsync to get a copy of the current source tree for the bleadperl branch and all maintenance branches:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-current .<br/>
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-5.12.x .<br/>
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-5.10.x .<br/>
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-5.8.x .<br/>
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-5.6.x .<br/>
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-5.005xx .<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(Add the &quot;--delete&quot; option to remove leftover files.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
To get a full list of the available sync points:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    % rsync perl5.git.perl.org::<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Write access via git</h2> If you have a commit bit, please see perlgit for more details on using git.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>PATCHING PERL</h1> If you're planning to do more extensive work than a single small fix, we encourage you to read the documentation below. This will help you focus your work and make your patches easier to incorporate into the Perl source.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Submitting patches</h2> If you have a small patch to submit, please submit it via perlbug. You can also send email directly to perlbug@perl.org. Please note that messages sent to perlbug may be held in a moderation queue, so you won't receive a response immediately.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You'll know your submission has been processed when you receive an email from our ticket tracking system. This email will give you a ticket number. Once your patch has made it to the ticket tracking system, it will also be sent to the perl5-porters@perl.org list.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Patches are reviewed and discussed on the p5p list. Simple, uncontroversial patches will usually be applied without any discussion. When the patch is applied, the ticket will be updated and you will receive email. In addition, an email will be sent to the p5p list.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In other cases, the patch will need more work or discussion. That will happen on the p5p list.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You are encouraged to participate in the discussion and advocate for your patch. Sometimes your patch may get lost in the shuffle. It's appropriate to send a reminder email to p5p if no action has been taken in a month. Please remember that the Perl 5 developers are all volunteers, and be polite.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Changes are always applied directly to the main development branch, called &quot;blead&quot;. Some patches may be backported to a maintenance branch. If you think your patch is appropriate for the maintenance branch, please explain why when you submit it.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Getting your patch accepted</h2> If you are submitting a code patch there are several things that you can do to help the Perl 5 Porters accept your patch.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Patch style</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
If you used git to check out the Perl source, then using &quot;git format-patch&quot; will produce a patch in a style suitable for Perl. The &quot;format-patch&quot; command produces one patch file for each commit you made. If you prefer to send a single patch for all commits, you can use &quot;git diff&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git co blead<br/>
  % git pull<br/>
  % git diff blead my-branch-name<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This produces a patch based on the difference between blead and your current branch. It's important to make sure that blead is up to date before producing the diff, that's why we call &quot;git pull&quot; first.<div class="spacer">
</div>
We strongly recommend that you use git if possible. It will make your life easier, and ours as well.<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, if you're not using git, you can still produce a suitable patch. You'll need a pristine copy of the Perl source to diff against. The porters prefer unified diffs. Using GNU &quot;diff&quot;, you can produce a diff like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % diff -Npurd perl.pristine perl.mine<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Make sure that you &quot;make realclean&quot; in your copy of Perl to remove any build artifacts, or you may get a confusing result.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Commit message</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
As you craft each patch you intend to submit to the Perl core, it's important to write a good commit message. This is especially important if your submission will consist of a series of commits.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first line of the commit message should be a short description without a period. It should be no longer than the subject line of an email, 50 characters being a good rule of thumb.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A lot of Git tools (Gitweb, GitHub, git log --pretty=oneline, ...) will only display the first line (cut off at 50 characters) when presenting commit summaries.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The commit message should include a description of the problem that the patch corrects or new functionality that the patch adds.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a general rule of thumb, your commit message should help a programmer who knows the Perl core quickly understand what you were trying to do, how you were trying to do it, and why the change matters to Perl.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Why<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Your commit message should describe why the change you are making is important. When someone looks at your change in six months or six years, your intent should be clear.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you're deprecating a feature with the intent of later simplifying another bit of code, say so. If you're fixing a performance problem or adding a new feature to support some other bit of the core, mention that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
What<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Your commit message should describe what part of the Perl core you're changing and what you expect your patch to do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
How<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
While it's not necessary for documentation changes, new tests or trivial patches, it's often worth explaining how your change works. Even if it's clear to you today, it may not be clear to a porter next month or next year.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
A commit message isn't intended to take the place of comments in your code. Commit messages should describe the change you made, while code comments should describe the current state of the code.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you've just implemented a new feature, complete with doc, tests and well-commented code, a brief commit message will often suffice. If, however, you've just changed a single character deep in the parser or lexer, you might need to write a small novel to ensure that future readers understand what you did and why you did it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Comments, Comments, Comments</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Be sure to adequately comment your code. While commenting every line is unnecessary, anything that takes advantage of side effects of operators, that creates changes that will be felt outside of the function being patched, or that others may find confusing should be documented. If you are going to err, it is better to err on the side of adding too many comments than too few.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The best comments explain <i>why</i> the code does what it does, not <i>what</i>  <i>it does</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Style</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
In general, please follow the particular style of the code you are patching.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In particular, follow these general guidelines for patching Perl sources:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
8-wide tabs (no exceptions!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
4-wide indents for code, 2-wide indents for nested CPP #defines</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Try hard not to exceed 79-columns</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
ANSI C prototypes</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Uncuddled elses and &quot;K&amp;R&quot; style for indenting control constructs</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
No C++ style (//) comments</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Mark places that need to be revisited with XXX (and revisit often!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Opening brace lines up with &quot;if&quot; when conditional spans multiple lines; should be at end-of-line otherwise</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In function definitions, name starts in column 0 (return value is on previous line)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Single space after keywords that are followed by parens, no space between function name and following paren</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Avoid assignments in conditionals, but if they're unavoidable, use extra paren, e.g. &quot;if (a &amp;&amp; (b = c)) ...&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;return foo;&quot; rather than &quot;return(foo);&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;if (!foo) ...&quot; rather than &quot;if (foo == FALSE) ...&quot; etc.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Test suite</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
If your patch changes code (rather than just changing documentation), you should also include one or more test cases which illustrate the bug you're fixing or validate the new functionality you're adding. In general, you should update an existing test file rather than create a new one.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Your test suite additions should generally follow these guidelines (courtesy of Gurusamy Sarathy &lt;gsar@activestate.com&gt;):<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Know what you're testing. Read the docs, and the source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Tend to fail, not succeed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Interpret results strictly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Use unrelated features (this will flush out bizarre interactions).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Use non-standard idioms (otherwise you are not testing TIMTOWTDI).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Avoid using hardcoded test numbers whenever possible (the EXPECTED/GOT found in t/op/tie.t is much more maintainable, and gives better failure reports).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Give meaningful error messages when a test fails.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Avoid using qx// and <i>system()</i> unless you are testing for them. If you do use them, make sure that you cover _all_ perl platforms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Unlink any temporary files you create.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Promote unforeseen warnings to errors with $SIG{__WARN__}.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Be sure to use the libraries and modules shipped with the version being tested, not those that were already installed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Add comments to the code explaining what you are testing for.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Make updating the '1..42' string unnecessary. Or make sure that you update it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Test _all_ behaviors of a given operator, library, or function.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Test all optional arguments.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Test return values in various contexts (boolean, scalar, list, lvalue).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use both global and lexical variables.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Don't forget the exceptional, pathological cases.</dd>

<h2>Patching a core module</h2> This works just like patching anything else, with one extra consideration.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some core modules also live on CPAN and are maintained outside of the Perl core. When the author updates the module, the updates are simply copied into the core.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Modules in the <i>cpan/</i> directory of the source tree are maintained outside of the Perl core. See that module's listing on documentation or its listing on &lt;http://search.cpan.org/&gt; for more information on reporting bugs and submitting patches.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In contrast, modules in the <i>dist/</i> directory are maintained in the core.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Updating perldelta</h2> For changes significant enough to warrant a  <i>pod/perldelta.pod</i> entry, the porters will greatly appreciate it if you submit a delta entry along with your actual change. Significant changes include, but are not limited to:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Adding, deprecating, or removing core features</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Adding, deprecating, removing, or upgrading core or dual-life modules</dd>

<div class="spacer">
</div>
Please make sure you add the perldelta entry to the right section within  <i>pod/perldelta.pod</i>. More information on how to write good perldelta entries is available in the &quot;Style&quot; section of  <i>Porting/how_to_write_a_perldelta.pod</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>What makes for a good patch?</h2> New features and extensions to the language can be contentious. There is no specific set of criteria which determine what features get added, but here are some questions to consider when developing a patch:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Does the concept match the general goals of Perl?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Our goals include, but are not limited to:<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>
<dd>
Keep it fast, simple, and useful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2.</dt>
<dd>
Keep features/concepts as orthogonal as possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
3.</dt>
<dd>
No arbitrary limits (platforms, data sizes, cultures).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
4.</dt>
<dd>
Keep it open and exciting to use/patch/advocate Perl everywhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
5.</dt>
<dd>
Either assimilate new technologies, or build bridges to them.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Where is the implementation?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
All the talk in the world is useless without an implementation. In almost every case, the person or people who argue for a new feature will be expected to be the ones who implement it. Porters capable of coding new features have their own agendas, and are not available to implement your (possibly good) idea.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Backwards compatibility</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
It's a cardinal sin to break existing Perl programs. New warnings can be contentious--some say that a program that emits warnings is not broken, while others say it is. Adding keywords has the potential to break programs, changing the meaning of existing token sequences or functions might break programs.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Perl 5 core includes mechanisms to help porters make backwards incompatible changes more compatible such as the feature and deprecate modules. Please use them when appropriate.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Could it be a module instead?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl 5 has extension mechanisms, modules and XS, specifically to avoid the need to keep changing the Perl interpreter. You can write modules that export functions, you can give those functions prototypes so they can be called like built-in functions, you can even write XS code to mess with the runtime data structures of the Perl interpreter if you want to implement really complicated things.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Whenever possible, new features should be prototyped in a CPAN module before they will be considered for the core.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Is the feature generic enough?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Is this something that only the submitter wants added to the language, or is it broadly useful?  Sometimes, instead of adding a feature with a tight focus, the porters might decide to wait until someone implements the more generalized feature.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Does it potentially introduce new bugs?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Radical rewrites of large chunks of the Perl interpreter have the potential to introduce new bugs.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>How big is it?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The smaller and more localized the change, the better. Similarly, a series of small patches is greatly preferred over a single large patch.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Does it preclude other desirable features?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
A patch is likely to be rejected if it closes off future avenues of development. For instance, a patch that placed a true and final interpretation on prototypes is likely to be rejected because there are still options for the future of prototypes that haven't been addressed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Is the implementation robust?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Good patches (tight code, complete, correct) stand more chance of going in. Sloppy or incorrect patches might be placed on the back burner until the pumpking has time to fix, or might be discarded altogether without further notice.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Is the implementation generic enough to be portable?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The worst patches make use of system-specific features. It's highly unlikely that non-portable additions to the Perl language will be accepted.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Is the implementation tested?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Patches which change behaviour (fixing bugs or introducing new features) must include regression tests to verify that everything works as expected.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Without tests provided by the original author, how can anyone else changing perl in the future be sure that they haven't unwittingly broken the behaviour the patch implements? And without tests, how can the patch's author be confident that his/her hard work put into the patch won't be accidentally thrown away by someone in the future?<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Is there enough documentation?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Patches without documentation are probably ill-thought out or incomplete. No features can be added or changed without documentation, so submitting a patch for the appropriate pod docs as well as the source code is important.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Is there another way to do it?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Larry said &quot;Although the Perl Slogan is <i>There's More Than One Way to</i>  <i>Do It</i>, I hesitate to make 10 ways to do something&quot;. This is a tricky heuristic to navigate, though--one man's essential addition is another man's pointless cruft.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Does it create too much work?</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Work for the pumpking, work for Perl programmers, work for module authors, ... Perl is supposed to be easy.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Patches speak louder than words</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Working code is always preferred to pie-in-the-sky ideas. A patch to add a feature stands a much higher chance of making it to the language than does a random feature request, no matter how fervently argued the request might be. This ties into &quot;Will it be useful?&quot;, as the fact that someone took the time to make the patch demonstrates a strong desire for the feature.</div>

<h1>TESTING</h1> The core uses the same testing style as the rest of Perl, a simple &quot;ok/not ok&quot; run through Test::Harness, but there are a few special considerations.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are three ways to write a test in the core. Test::More,  <i>t/test.pl</i> and ad hoc &quot;print $test ? &quot;ok 42\n&quot; : &quot;not ok 42\n&quot;&quot;. The decision of which to use depends on what part of the test suite you're working on. This is a measure to prevent a high-level failure (such as Config.pm breaking) from causing basic functionality tests to fail.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>t/test.pl</i> library provides some of the features of Test::More, but avoids loading most modules and uses as few core features as possible.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you write your own test, use the Test Anything Protocol.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>t/base</i> and <i>t/comp</i><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Since we don't know if require works, or even subroutines, use ad hoc tests for these two. Step carefully to avoid using the feature being tested.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>t/cmd</i>, <i>t/run</i>, <i>t/io</i> and <i>t/op</i><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Now that basic <i>require()</i> and subroutines are tested, you can use the  <i>t/test.pl</i> library.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can also use certain libraries like Config conditionally, but be sure to skip the test gracefully if it's not there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Everything else<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Now that the core of Perl is tested, Test::More can and should be used. You can also use the full suite of core modules in the tests.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When you say &quot;make test&quot;, Perl uses the <i>t/TEST</i> program to run the test suite (except under Win32 where it uses  <i>t/harness</i> instead). All tests are run from the  <i>t/</i> directory, <b>not</b> the directory which contains the test. This causes some problems with the tests in  <i>lib/</i>, so here's some opportunity for some patching.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You must be triply conscious of cross-platform concerns. This usually boils down to using File::Spec and avoiding things like &quot;fork()&quot; and &quot;system()&quot; unless absolutely necessary.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Special &quot;make test&quot; targets</h2> There are various special make targets that can be used to test Perl slightly differently than the standard &quot;test&quot; target. Not all them are expected to give a 100% success rate. Many of them have several aliases, and many of them are not available on certain operating systems.<dl>

test_harness<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Run the test suite with the <i>t/harness</i> controlling program, instead of  <i>t/TEST</i>. <i>t/harness</i> is more sophisticated, and uses the Test::Harness module, thus using this test target supposes that perl mostly works. The main advantage for our purposes is that it prints a detailed summary of failed tests at the end. Also, unlike  <i>t/TEST</i>, it doesn't redirect stderr to stdout.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that under Win32 <i>t/harness</i> is always used instead of <i>t/TEST</i>, so there is no special &quot;test_harness&quot; target.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Under Win32's &quot;test&quot; target you may use the TEST_SWITCHES and TEST_FILES environment variables to control the behaviour of  <i>t/harness</i>. This means you can say<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    nmake test TEST_FILES=&quot;op/*.t&quot;<br/>
    nmake test TEST_SWITCHES=&quot;-torture&quot; TEST_FILES=&quot;op/*.t&quot;<br/>

<h2>Parallel tests</h2> The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on Unix-like platforms. Instead of running &quot;make test&quot;, set &quot;TEST_JOBS&quot; in your environment to the number of tests to run in parallel, and run &quot;make test_harness&quot;. On a Bourne-like shell, this can be done as<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness  # Run 3 tests in parallel<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
An environment variable is used, rather than parallel make itself, because TAP::Harness needs to be able to schedule individual non-conflicting test scripts itself, and there is no standard interface to &quot;make&quot; utilities to interact with their job schedulers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that currently some test scripts may fail when run in parallel (most notably &quot;ext/IO/t/io_dir.t&quot;). If necessary, run just the failing scripts again sequentially and see if the failures go away.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Running tests by hand</h2> You can run part of the test suite by hand by using one of the following commands from the  <i>t/</i> directory:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    ./perl -I../lib TEST list-of-.t-files<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
or<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    ./perl -I../lib harness list-of-.t-files<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(If you don't specify test scripts, the whole test suite will be run.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Using <i>t/harness</i> for testing</h2> If you use &quot;harness&quot; for testing, you have several command line options available to you. The arguments are as follows, and are in the order that they must appear if used together.<div class="spacer">

    harness -v -torture -re=pattern LIST OF FILES TO TEST<br/>

Subscribe to perl5-porters, follow the patches and try and understand them; don't be afraid to ask if there's a portion you're not clear on - who knows, you may unearth a bug in the patch...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>

Do read the README associated with your operating system, e.g. README.aix on the IBM AIX OS. Don't hesitate to supply patches to that README if you find anything missing or changed over a new OS release.</dd>

<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Find an area of Perl that seems interesting to you, and see if you can work out how it works. Scan through the source, and step over it in the debugger. Play, poke, investigate, fiddle! You'll probably get to understand not just your chosen area but a much wider range of  <i>perl</i>'s activity as well, and probably sooner than you'd think.</dd>

<h2>&quot;The Road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began.&quot;</h2> If you can do these things, you've started on the long road to Perl porting. Thanks for wanting to help make Perl better - and happy hacking!</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Metaphoric Quotations</h2> If you recognized the quote about the Road above, you're in luck.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Most software projects begin each file with a literal description of each file's purpose. Perl instead begins each with a literary allusion to that file's purpose.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Like chapters in many books, all top-level Perl source files (along with a few others here and there) begin with an epigramic inscription that alludes, indirectly and metaphorically, to the material you're about to read.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Quotations are taken from writings of J.R.R. Tolkien pertaining to his Legendarium, almost always from  <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Chapters and page numbers are given using the following editions:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>The Hobbit</i>, by J.R.R. Tolkien. The hardcover, 70th-anniversary edition of 2007 was used, published in the UK by Harper Collins Publishers and in the US by the Houghton Mifflin Company.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, by J.R.R. Tolkien. The hardcover, 50th-anniversary edition of 2004 was used, published in the UK by Harper Collins Publishers and in the US by the Houghton Mifflin Company.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>The Lays of Beleriand</i>, by J.R.R. Tolkien and published posthumously by his son and literary executor, C.J.R. Tolkien, being the 3rd of the 12 volumes in Christopher's mammoth  <i>History of Middle Earth</i>. Page numbers derive from the hardcover edition, first published in 1983 by George Allen &amp; Unwin; no page numbers changed for the special 3-volume omnibus edition of 2002 or the various trade-paper editions, all again now by Harper Collins or Houghton Mifflin.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Other JRRT books fair game for quotes would thus include <i>The</i>  <i>Adventures of Tom Bombadil</i>, <i>The Silmarillion</i>, <i>Unfinished Tales</i>, and  <i>The Tale of the Children of Hurin</i>, all but the first posthumously assembled by CJRT. But  <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> itself is perfectly fine and probably best to quote from, provided you can find a suitable quote there.<div class="spacer">
</div>
So if you were to supply a new, complete, top-level source file to add to Perl, you should conform to this peculiar practice by yourself selecting an appropriate quotation from Tolkien, retaining the original spelling and punctuation and using the same format the rest of the quotes are in. Indirect and oblique is just fine; remember, it's a metaphor, so being meta is, after all, what it's for.</div>
