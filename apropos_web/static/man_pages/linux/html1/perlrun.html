<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The normal way to run a Perl program is by making it directly executable, or else by passing the name of the source file as an argument on the command line.  (An interactive Perl environment is also possible--see perldebug for details on how to do that.) Upon startup, Perl looks for your program in one of the following places:<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>
<dd>
Specified line by line via <b>-e</b> or <b>-E</b> switches on the command line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2.</dt>
<dd>
Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command line. (Note that systems supporting the &quot;#!&quot; notation invoke interpreters this way. See &quot;Location of Perl&quot;.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
3.</dt>
<dd>
Passed in implicitly via standard input.  This works only if there are no filename arguments--to pass arguments to a STDIN-read program you must explicitly specify a &quot;-&quot; for the program name.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
With methods 2 and 3, Perl starts parsing the input file from the beginning, unless you've specified a  <b>-x</b> switch, in which case it scans for the first line starting with &quot;#!&quot; and containing the word &quot;perl&quot;, and starts there instead.  This is useful for running a program embedded in a larger message.  (In this case you would indicate the end of the program using the &quot;__END__&quot; token.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;#!&quot; line is always examined for switches as the line is being parsed.  Thus, if you're on a machine that allows only one argument with the &quot;#!&quot; line, or worse, doesn't even recognize the &quot;#!&quot; line, you still can get consistent switch behaviour regardless of how Perl was invoked, even if  <b>-x</b> was used to find the beginning of the program.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Because historically some operating systems silently chopped off kernel interpretation of the &quot;#!&quot; line after 32 characters, some switches may be passed in on the command line, and some may not; you could even get a &quot;-&quot; without its letter, if you're not careful. You probably want to make sure that all your switches fall either before or after that 32-character boundary.  Most switches don't actually care if they're processed redundantly, but getting a &quot;-&quot; instead of a complete switch could cause Perl to try to execute standard input instead of your program.  And a partial  <b>-I</b> switch could also cause odd results.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some switches do care if they are processed twice, for instance combinations of  <b>-l</b> and <b>-0</b>.  Either put all the switches after the 32-character boundary (if applicable), or replace the use of  <b>-0</b><i>digits</i> by &quot;BEGIN{ $/ = &quot;\0digits&quot;; }&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Parsing of the &quot;#!&quot; switches starts wherever &quot;perl&quot; is mentioned in the line. The sequences &quot;-*&quot; and &quot;- &quot; are specifically ignored so that you could, if you were so inclined, say<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    #!/bin/sh<br/>
    #! -*-perl-*-<br/>
    eval 'exec perl -x -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'<br/>
        if 0;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
to let Perl see the <b>-p</b> switch.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A similar trick involves the <i>env</i> program, if you have it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    #!/usr/bin/env perl<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The examples above use a relative path to the perl interpreter, getting whatever version is first in the user's path.  If you want a specific version of Perl, say, perl5.005_57, you should place that directly in the &quot;#!&quot; line's path.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the &quot;#!&quot; line does not contain the word &quot;perl&quot;, the program named after the &quot;#!&quot; is executed instead of the Perl interpreter.  This is slightly bizarre, but it helps people on machines that don't do &quot;#!&quot;, because they can tell a program that their SHELL is  <i>/usr/bin/perl</i>, and Perl will then dispatch the program to the correct interpreter for them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
After locating your program, Perl compiles the entire program to an internal form.  If there are any compilation errors, execution of the program is not attempted.  (This is unlike the typical shell script, which might run part-way through before finding a syntax error.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the program is syntactically correct, it is executed.  If the program runs off the end without hitting an  <i>exit()</i> or <i>die()</i> operator, an implicit exit(0) is provided to indicate successful completion.<div class="subsection">
<h2>#! and quoting on non-Unix systems</h2> Unix's &quot;#!&quot; technique can be simulated on other systems:<dl>
<dt>
OS/2</dt>
<dd>
Put<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    extproc perl -S -your_switches<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
as the first line in &quot;*.cmd&quot; file (<b>-S</b> due to a bug in cmd.exe's `extproc' handling).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
MS-DOS</dt>
<dd>
Create a batch file to run your program, and codify it in &quot;ALTERNATE_SHEBANG&quot; (see the  <i>dosish.h</i> file in the source distribution for more information).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Win95/NT</dt>
<dd>
The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState installer for Perl, will modify the Registry to associate the  <i>.pl</i> extension with the perl interpreter.  If you install Perl by other means (including building from the sources), you may have to modify the Registry yourself.  Note that this means you can no longer tell the difference between an executable Perl program and a Perl library file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
VMS</dt>
<dd>
Put<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $ perl -mysw 'f$env(&quot;procedure&quot;)' 'p1' 'p2' 'p3' 'p4' 'p5' 'p6' 'p7' 'p8' !<br/>
    $ exit++ + ++$status != 0 and $exit = $status = undef;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
at the top of your program, where <b>-mysw</b> are any command line switches you want to pass to Perl.  You can now invoke the program directly, by saying &quot;perl program&quot;, or as a DCL procedure, by saying @program (or implicitly via  <i>DCL$PATH</i> by just using the name of the program).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This incantation is a bit much to remember, but Perl will display it for you if you say &quot;perl &quot;-V:startperl&quot;&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Command-interpreters on non-Unix systems have rather different ideas on quoting than Unix shells.  You'll need to learn the special characters in your command-interpreter (&quot;*&quot;, &quot;\&quot; and &quot;&quot;&quot; are common) and how to protect whitespace and these characters to run one-liners (see  <b>-e</b> below).<div class="spacer">
</div>
On some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double ones, which you must  <i>not</i> do on Unix or Plan 9 systems.  You might also have to change a single % to a %%.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    # Unix<br/>
    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'<br/>
<br/>
    # MS-DOS, etc.<br/>
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Hello world\n\&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
    # VMS<br/>
    perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The problem is that none of this is reliable: it depends on the command and it is entirely possible neither works.  If  <i>4DOS</i> were the command shell, this would probably work better:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>CMD.EXE</b> in Windows NT slipped a lot of standard Unix functionality in when nobody was looking, but just try to find documentation for its quoting rules.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is no general solution to all of this.  It's just a mess.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Location of Perl</h2> It may seem obvious to say, but Perl is useful only when users can easily find it.  When possible, it's good for both  <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> and  <i>/usr/local/bin/perl</i> to be symlinks to the actual binary.  If that can't be done, system administrators are strongly encouraged to put (symlinks to) perl and its accompanying utilities into a directory typically found along a user's PATH, or in some other obvious and convenient place.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In this documentation, &quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot; on the first line of the program will stand in for whatever method works on your system.  You are advised to use a specific path if you care about a specific version.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl5.00554<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
or if you just want to be running at least version, place a statement like this at the top of your program:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use 5.005_54;<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Command Switches</h2> As with all standard commands, a single-character switch may be clustered with the following switch, if any.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -spi.orig   # same as -s -p -i.orig<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Switches include:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-0</b>[<i>octal/hexadecimal</i>]</dt>
<dd>
specifies the input record separator ($/) as an octal or hexadecimal number.  If there are no digits, the null character is the separator.  Other switches may precede or follow the digits.  For example, if you have a version of  <i>find</i> which can print filenames terminated by the null character, you can say this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | perl -n0e unlink<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in paragraph mode. Any value 0400 or above will cause Perl to slurp files whole, but by convention the value 0777 is the one normally used for this purpose.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can also specify the separator character using hexadecimal notation:  <b>-0x</b><b><i>HHH...</i></b><b></b>, where the &quot;<i>H</i>&quot; are valid hexadecimal digits.  Unlike the octal form, this one may be used to specify any Unicode character, even those beyond 0xFF.  So if you  <i>really</i> want a record separator of 0777, specify it as  <b>-0x1FF</b>.  (This means that you cannot use the <b>-x</b> option with a directory name that consists of hexadecimal digits, or else Perl will think you have specified a hex number to  <b>-0</b>.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-a</b></dt>
<dd>
turns on autosplit mode when used with a <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>.  An implicit split command to the @F array is done as the first thing inside the implicit while loop produced by the  <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -ane 'print pop(@F), &quot;\n&quot;;'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
is equivalent to<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {<br/>
        @F = split(' ');<br/>
        print pop(@F), &quot;\n&quot;;<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An alternate delimiter may be specified using <b>-F</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-C [</b><b><i>number/list</i></b><b>]</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>-C</b> flag controls some of the Perl Unicode features.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As of 5.8.1, the <b>-C</b> can be followed either by a number or a list of option letters.  The letters, their numeric values, and effects are as follows; listing the letters is equal to summing the numbers.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    I     1   STDIN is assumed to be in UTF-8<br/>
    O     2   STDOUT will be in UTF-8<br/>
    E     4   STDERR will be in UTF-8<br/>
    S     7   I + O + E<br/>
    i     8   UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for input streams<br/>
    o    16   UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for output streams<br/>
    D    24   i + o<br/>
    A    32   the @ARGV elements are expected to be strings encoded<br/>
              in UTF-8<br/>
    L    64   normally the &quot;IOEioA&quot; are unconditional,<br/>
              the L makes them conditional on the locale environment<br/>
              variables (the LC_ALL, LC_TYPE, and LANG, in the order<br/>
              of decreasing precedence) -- if the variables indicate<br/>
              UTF-8, then the selected &quot;IOEioA&quot; are in effect<br/>
    a   256   Set ${^UTF8CACHE} to -1, to run the UTF-8 caching code in<br/>
              debugging mode.<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For example, <b>-COE</b> and <b>-C6</b> will both turn on UTF-8-ness on both STDOUT and STDERR.  Repeating letters is just redundant, not cumulative nor toggling.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The &quot;io&quot; options mean that any subsequent <i>open()</i> (or similar I/O operations) in the current file scope will have the &quot;:utf8&quot; PerlIO layer implicitly applied to them, in other words, UTF-8 is expected from any input stream, and UTF-8 is produced to any output stream.  This is just the default, with explicit layers in  <i>open()</i> and with <i>binmode()</i> one can manipulate streams as usual.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>-C</b> on its own (not followed by any number or option list), or the empty string &quot;&quot; for the &quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot; environment variable, has the same effect as  <b>-CSDL</b>.  In other words, the standard I/O handles and the default &quot;open()&quot; layer are UTF-8-fied  <i>but</i> only if the locale environment variables indicate a UTF-8 locale.  This behaviour follows the  <i>implicit</i> (and problematic) UTF-8 behaviour of Perl 5.8.0.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can use <b>-C0</b> (or &quot;0&quot; for &quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot;) to explicitly disable all the above Unicode features.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The read-only magic variable &quot;${^UNICODE}&quot; reflects the numeric value of this setting.  This variable is set during Perl startup and is thereafter read-only.  If you want runtime effects, use the three-arg  <i>open()</i> (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc), the two-arg <i>binmode()</i> (see &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc), and the &quot;open&quot; pragma (see open).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(In Perls earlier than 5.8.1 the <b>-C</b> switch was a Win32-only switch that enabled the use of Unicode-aware &quot;wide system call&quot; Win32 APIs. This feature was practically unused, however, and the command line switch was therefore &quot;recycled&quot;.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Note:</b> Since perl 5.10.1, if the <b>-C</b> option is used on the &quot;#!&quot; line, it must be specified on the command line as well, since the standard streams are already set up at this point in the execution of the perl interpreter. You can also use  <i>binmode()</i> to set the encoding of an I/O stream.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-c</b></dt>
<dd>
causes Perl to check the syntax of the program and then exit without executing it.  Actually, it  <i>will</i> execute and &quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, or &quot;CHECK&quot; blocks and any &quot;use&quot; statements: these are considered as occurring outside the execution of your program.  &quot;INIT&quot; and &quot;END&quot; blocks, however, will be skipped.</dd>

runs the program under the control of a debugging, profiling, or tracing module installed as &quot;Devel:: <i>MOD</i>&quot;. E.g., <b>-d:DProf</b> executes the program using the &quot;Devel::DProf&quot; profiler.  As with the  <b>-M</b> flag, options may be passed to the &quot;Devel:: <i>MOD</i>&quot; package where they will be received and interpreted by the &quot;Devel:: <i>MOD</i>::import&quot; routine.  Again, like <b>-M</b>, use - <b>-d:-</b><b><i>MOD</i></b><b></b> to call &quot;Devel::<i>MOD</i>::unimport&quot; instead of import.  The comma-separated list of options must follow a &quot;=&quot; character.  If  <b>t</b> is specified, it indicates to the debugger that threads will be used in the code being debugged.  See perldebug.</dd>

sets debugging flags.  To watch how it executes your program, use  <b>-Dtls</b>.  (This works only if debugging is compiled into your Perl.)  Another nice value is  <b>-Dx</b>, which lists your compiled syntax tree.  And  <b>-Dr</b> displays compiled regular expressions; the format of the output is explained in perldebguts.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As an alternative, specify a number instead of list of letters (e.g.,  <b>-D14</b> is equivalent to <b>-Dtls</b>):<div style="height: 1.00em;">

All these flags require <b>-DDEBUGGING</b> when you compile the Perl executable (but see &quot;:opd&quot; in Devel::Peek or &quot;'debug' mode&quot; in re which may change this).

Disable executing <i></i><i>$Config</i><i>{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl</i> at startup.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl can be built so that it by default will try to execute  <i></i><i>$Config</i><i>{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl</i> at startup (in a BEGIN block). This is a hook that allows the sysadmin to customize how Perl behaves. It can for instance be used to add entries to the @INC array to make Perl find modules in non-standard locations.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl actually inserts the following code:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>

<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Since it is an actual &quot;do&quot; (not a &quot;require&quot;), <i>sitecustomize.pl</i> doesn't need to return a true value. The code is run in package &quot;main&quot;, in its own lexical scope. However, if the script dies, $@ will not be set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The value of $Config{sitelib} is also determined in C code and not read from &quot;Config.pm&quot;, which is not loaded.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The code is executed <i>very</i> early. For example, any changes made to @INC will show up in the output of `perl -V`. Of course, &quot;END&quot; blocks will be likewise executed very late.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To determine at runtime if this capability has been compiled in your perl, you can check the value of $Config{usesitecustomize}.</dd>

<b>-i</b>[<i>extension</i>]</dt>
<dd>
specifies that files processed by the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; construct are to be edited in-place.  It does this by renaming the input file, opening the output file by the original name, and selecting that output file as the default for  <i>print()</i> statements.  The extension, if supplied, is used to modify the name of the old file to make a backup copy, following these rules:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If no extension is supplied, no backup is made and the current file is overwritten.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the extension doesn't contain a &quot;*&quot;, then it is appended to the end of the current filename as a suffix.  If the extension does contain one or more &quot;*&quot; characters, then each &quot;*&quot; is replaced with the current filename.  In Perl terms, you could think of this as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    ($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$file_name/g;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This allows you to add a prefix to the backup file, instead of (or in addition to) a suffix:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $ perl -pi'orig_*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA    # backup to 'orig_fileA'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Or even to place backup copies of the original files into another directory (provided the directory already exists):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $ perl -pi'old/*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA # backup to 'old/fileA.orig'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
These sets of one-liners are equivalent:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $ perl -pi -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA            # overwrite current file<br/>
    $ perl -pi'*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA         # overwrite current file<br/>
<br/>
    $ perl -pi'.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA     # backup to 'fileA.orig'<br/>
    $ perl -pi'*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA    # backup to 'fileA.orig'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
From the shell, saying<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $ perl -p -i.orig -e &quot;s/foo/bar/; ... &quot;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
is the same as using the program:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -pi.orig<br/>
    s/foo/bar/;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
which is equivalent to<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    #!/usr/bin/perl<br/>
    $extension = '.orig';<br/>
    LINE: while (&lt;&gt;) {<br/>
        if ($ARGV ne $oldargv) {<br/>
            if ($extension !~ /\*/) {<br/>
                $backup = $ARGV . $extension;<br/>
            }<br/>
            else {<br/>
                ($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$ARGV/g;<br/>
            }<br/>
            rename($ARGV, $backup);<br/>
            open(ARGVOUT, &quot;&gt;$ARGV&quot;);<br/>
            select(ARGVOUT);<br/>
            $oldargv = $ARGV;<br/>
        }<br/>
        s/foo/bar/;<br/>
    }<br/>
    continue {<br/>
        print;  # this prints to original filename<br/>
    }<br/>
    select(STDOUT);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
except that the <b>-i</b> form doesn't need to compare $ARGV to $oldargv to know when the filename has changed.  It does, however, use ARGVOUT for the selected filehandle.  Note that STDOUT is restored as the default output filehandle after the loop.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As shown above, Perl creates the backup file whether or not any output is actually changed.  So this is just a fancy way to copy files:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $ perl -p -i'/some/file/path/*' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...<br/>
or<br/>
    $ perl -p -i'.orig' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can use &quot;eof&quot; without parentheses to locate the end of each input file, in case you want to append to each file, or reset line numbering (see example in &quot;eof&quot; in perlfunc).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If, for a given file, Perl is unable to create the backup file as specified in the extension then it will skip that file and continue on with the next one (if it exists).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For a discussion of issues surrounding file permissions and <b>-i</b>, see &quot;Why does Perl let me delete read-only files?  Why does -i clobber protected files?  Isn't this a bug in Perl?&quot; in perlfaq5.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You cannot use <b>-i</b> to create directories or to strip extensions from files.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl does not expand &quot;~&quot; in filenames, which is good, since some folks use it for their backup files:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $ perl -pi~ -e 's/foo/bar/' file1 file2 file3...<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that because <b>-i</b> renames or deletes the original file before creating a new file of the same name, Unix-style soft and hard links will not be preserved.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Finally, the <b>-i</b> switch does not impede execution when no files are given on the command line.  In this case, no backup is made (the original file cannot, of course, be determined) and processing proceeds from STDIN to STDOUT as might be expected.</dd>

<dd>
enables automatic line-ending processing.  It has two separate effects.  First, it automatically chomps $/ (the input record separator) when used with  <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>.  Second, it assigns &quot;$\&quot; (the output record separator) to have the value of  <i>octnum</i> so that any print statements will have that separator added back on. If  <i>octnum</i> is omitted, sets &quot;$\&quot; to the current value of $/.  For instance, to trim lines to 80 columns:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -lpe 'substr($_, 80) = &quot;&quot;'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that the assignment &quot;$\ = $/&quot; is done when the switch is processed, so the input record separator can be different than the output record separator if the  <b>-l</b> switch is followed by a <b>-0</b> switch:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    gnufind / -print0 | perl -ln0e 'print &quot;found $_&quot; if -p'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

This sets &quot;$\&quot; to newline and then sets $/ to the null character.</dd>

<b>-m</b><i>module</i> executes &quot;use&quot; <i>module</i> &quot;();&quot; before executing your program.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>-M</b><i>module</i> executes &quot;use&quot; <i>module</i> &quot;;&quot; before executing your program.  You can use quotes to add extra code after the module name, e.g., '-M <i>MODULE</i> qw(foo bar)'.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the first character after the <b>-M</b> or <b>-m</b> is a dash (<b>-</b>) then the 'use' is replaced with 'no'.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A little builtin syntactic sugar means you can also say  <b>-m</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b><b>=foo,bar</b> or <b>-M</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b><b>=foo,bar</b> as a shortcut for  <b>'-M</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b><b> qw(foo bar)'</b>.  This avoids the need to use quotes when importing symbols.  The actual code generated by  <b>-M</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b><b>=foo,bar</b> is &quot;use module split(/,/,q{foo,bar})&quot;.  Note that the &quot;=&quot; form removes the distinction between  <b>-m</b> and <b>-M</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A consequence of this is that <b>-M</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b><b>=number</b> never does a version check, unless &quot; <i>MODULE</i>::import()&quot; itself is set up to do a version check, which could happen for example if  <i>MODULE</i> inherits from Exporter.</dd>

<b>-n</b></dt>
<dd>
causes Perl to assume the following loop around your program, which makes it iterate over filename arguments somewhat like  <i>sed -n</i> or  <i>awk</i>:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  LINE:<br/>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {<br/>
        ...             # your program goes here<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that the lines are not printed by default.  See <b>-p</b> to have lines printed.  If a file named by an argument cannot be opened for some reason, Perl warns you about it and moves on to the next file.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Also note that &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; passes command line arguments to &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc, which doesn't necessarily interpret them as file names. See  perlop for possible security implications.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Here is an efficient way to delete all files that haven't been modified for at least a week:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

    find . -mtime +7 -print | perl -nle unlink<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is faster than using the <b>-exec</b> switch of <i>find</i> because you don't have to start a process on every filename found.  It does suffer from the bug of mishandling newlines in pathnames, which you can fix if you follow the example under  <b>-0</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

If a file named by an argument cannot be opened for some reason, Perl warns you about it, and moves on to the next file.  Note that the lines are printed automatically.  An error occurring during printing is treated as fatal.  To suppress printing use the  <b>-n</b> switch.  A <b>-p</b> overrides a  <b>-n</b> switch.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<b>-s</b></dt>
<dd>
enables rudimentary switch parsing for switches on the command line after the program name but before any filename arguments (or before an argument of  <b>--</b>).  Any switch found there is removed from @ARGV and sets the corresponding variable in the Perl program.  The following program prints &quot;1&quot; if the program is invoked with a  <b>-xyz</b> switch, and &quot;abc&quot; if it is invoked with  <b>-xyz=abc</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -s<br/>
    if ($xyz) { print &quot;$xyz\n&quot; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Do note that a switch like <b>--help</b> creates the variable &quot;${-help}&quot;, which is not compliant with &quot;use strict &quot;refs&quot;&quot;.  Also, when using this option on a script with warnings enabled you may get a lot of spurious &quot;used only once&quot; warnings.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-S</b></dt>
<dd>
makes Perl use the PATH environment variable to search for the program unless the name of the program contains path separators.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On some platforms, this also makes Perl append suffixes to the filename while searching for it.  For example, on Win32 platforms, the &quot;.bat&quot; and &quot;.cmd&quot; suffixes are appended if a lookup for the original name fails, and if the name does not already end in one of those suffixes.  If your Perl was compiled with &quot;DEBUGGING&quot; turned on, using the  <b>-Dp</b> switch to Perl shows how the search progresses.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Typically this is used to emulate &quot;#!&quot; startup on platforms that don't support &quot;#!&quot;.  It's also convenient when debugging a script that uses &quot;#!&quot;, and is thus normally found by the shell's $PATH search mechanism.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This example works on many platforms that have a shell compatible with Bourne shell:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    #!/usr/bin/perl<br/>
    eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'<br/>
            if $running_under_some_shell;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The system ignores the first line and feeds the program to <i>/bin/sh</i>, which proceeds to try to execute the Perl program as a shell script. The shell executes the second line as a normal shell command, and thus starts up the Perl interpreter.  On some systems $0 doesn't always contain the full pathname, so the  <b>-S</b> tells Perl to search for the program if necessary.  After Perl locates the program, it parses the lines and ignores them because the variable $running_under_some_shell is never true.  If the program will be interpreted by csh, you will need to replace &quot;${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&quot; with $*, even though that doesn't understand embedded spaces (and such) in the argument list.  To start up  <i>sh</i> rather than  <i>csh</i>, some systems may have to replace the &quot;#!&quot; line with a line containing just a colon, which will be politely ignored by Perl.  Other systems can't control that, and need a totally devious construct that will work under any of  <i>csh</i>, <i>sh</i>, or Perl, such as the following:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        eval '(exit $?0)' &amp;&amp; eval 'exec perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'<br/>
        &amp; eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 $argv:q'<br/>
                if $running_under_some_shell;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the filename supplied contains directory separators (and so is an absolute or relative pathname), and if that file is not found, platforms that append file extensions will do so and try to look for the file with those extensions added, one by one.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On DOS-like platforms, if the program does not contain directory separators, it will first be searched for in the current directory before being searched for on the PATH.  On Unix platforms, the program will be searched for strictly on the PATH.</dd>

Like <b>-T</b>, but taint checks will issue warnings rather than fatal errors.  These warnings can now be controlled normally with &quot;no warnings qw(taint)&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<b>Note: This is not a substitute for </b><b>&quot;-T&quot;</b><b>!</b> This is meant to be used  <i>only</i> as a temporary development aid while securing legacy code: for real production code and for new secure code written from scratch, always use the real  <b>-T</b>.</dd>

turns on &quot;taint&quot; so you can test them.  Ordinarily these checks are done only when running setuid or setgid.  It's a good idea to turn them on explicitly for programs that run on behalf of someone else whom you might not necessarily trust, such as CGI programs or any internet servers you might write in Perl.  See perlsec for details.  For security reasons, this option must be seen by Perl quite early; usually this means it must appear early on the command line or in the &quot;#!&quot; line for systems which support that construct.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-u</b></dt>
<dd>
This switch causes Perl to dump core after compiling your program.  You can then in theory take this core dump and turn it into an executable file by using the  <i>undump</i> program (not supplied). This speeds startup at the expense of some disk space (which you can minimize by stripping the executable).  (Still, a &quot;hello world&quot; executable comes out to about 200K on my machine.)  If you want to execute a portion of your program before dumping, use the  <i>dump()</i> operator instead.  Note: availability of  <i>undump</i> is platform specific and may not be available for a specific port of Perl.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-U</b></dt>
<dd>
allows Perl to do unsafe operations.  Currently the only &quot;unsafe&quot; operations are attempting to unlink directories while running as superuser and running setuid programs with fatal taint checks turned into warnings. Note that warnings must be enabled along with this option to actually  <i>generate</i> the taint-check warnings.</dd>

<dt>
<b>-V:</b><i>configvar</i></dt>
<dd>
Prints to STDOUT the value of the named configuration variable(s), with multiples when your &quot; <i>configvar</i>&quot; argument looks like a regex (has non-letters).  For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $ perl -V:libc<br/>
        libc='/lib/libc-2.2.4.so';<br/>
    $ perl -V:lib.<br/>
        libs='-lnsl -lgdbm -ldb -ldl -lm -lcrypt -lutil -lc';<br/>
        libc='/lib/libc-2.2.4.so';<br/>
    $ perl -V:lib.*<br/>
        libpth='/usr/local/lib /lib /usr/lib';<br/>
        libs='-lnsl -lgdbm -ldb -ldl -lm -lcrypt -lutil -lc';<br/>
        lib_ext='.a';<br/>
        libc='/lib/libc-2.2.4.so';<br/>
        libperl='libperl.a';<br/>
        ....<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Additionally, extra colons can be used to control formatting.  A trailing colon suppresses the linefeed and terminator &quot;;&quot;, allowing you to embed queries into shell commands.  (mnemonic: PATH separator &quot;:&quot;.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $ echo &quot;compression-vars: &quot; `perl -V:z.*: ` &quot; are here !&quot;<br/>
    compression-vars:  zcat='' zip='zip'  are here !<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A leading colon removes the &quot;name=&quot; part of the response, this allows you to map to the name you need.  (mnemonic: empty label)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $ echo &quot;goodvfork=&quot;`./perl -Ilib -V::usevfork`<br/>
    goodvfork=false;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Leading and trailing colons can be used together if you need positional parameter values without the names.  Note that in the case below, the &quot;PERL_API&quot; params are returned in alphabetical order.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $ echo building_on `perl -V::osname: -V::PERL_API_.*:` now<br/>
    building_on 'linux' '5' '1' '9' now<br/>

prints warnings about dubious constructs, such as variable names mentioned only once and scalar variables used before being set; redefined subroutines; references to undefined filehandles; filehandles opened read-only that you are attempting to write on; values used as a number that don't  <i>look</i> like numbers; using an array as though it were a scalar; if your subroutines recurse more than 100 deep; and innumerable other things.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This switch really just enables the global $^W variable; normally, the lexically scoped &quot;use warnings&quot; pragma is preferred. You can disable or promote into fatal errors specific warnings using &quot;__WARN__&quot; hooks, as described in perlvar and &quot;warn&quot; in perlfunc. See also perldiag and perltrap.  A fine-grained warning facility is also available if you want to manipulate entire classes of warnings; see warnings or perllexwarn.</dd>

tells Perl that the program is embedded in a larger chunk of unrelated text, such as in a mail message.  Leading garbage will be discarded until the first line that starts with &quot;#!&quot; and contains the string &quot;perl&quot;.  Any meaningful switches on that line will be applied.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
All references to line numbers by the program (warnings, errors, ...) will treat the &quot;#!&quot; line as the first line. Thus a warning on the 2nd line of the program, which is on the 100th line in the file will be reported as line 2, not as line 100. This can be overridden by using the &quot;#line&quot; directive. (See &quot;Plain Old Comments (Not!)&quot; in perlsyn)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If a directory name is specified, Perl will switch to that directory before running the program.  The  <b>-x</b> switch controls only the disposal of leading garbage.  The program must be terminated with &quot;__END__&quot; if there is trailing garbage to be ignored;  the program can process any or all of the trailing garbage via the &quot;DATA&quot; filehandle if desired.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The directory, if specified, must appear immediately following the <b>-x</b> with no intervening whitespace.</dd>

<dt>
PERL5LIB</dt>
<dd>
A list of directories in which to look for Perl library files before looking in the standard library and the current directory.  Any architecture-specific directories under the specified locations are automatically included if they exist, with this lookup done at interpreter startup time.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If PERL5LIB is not defined, PERLLIB is used.  Directories are separated (like in PATH) by a colon on Unixish platforms and by a semicolon on Windows (the proper path separator being given by the command &quot;perl -V: <i>path_sep</i>&quot;).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When running taint checks, either because the program was running setuid or setgid, or the  <b>-T</b> or <b>-t</b> switch was specified, neither PERL5LIB nor PERLLIB is consulted. The program should instead say:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use lib &quot;/my/directory&quot;;<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL5OPT</dt>
<dd>
Command-line options (switches).  Switches in this variable are treated as if they were on every Perl command line.  Only the  <b>-[CDIMUdmtwW]</b> switches are allowed.  When running taint checks (either because the program was running setuid or setgid, or because the  <b>-T</b> or <b>-t</b> switch was used), this variable is ignored.  If PERL5OPT begins with  <b>- T</b>, tainting will be enabled and subsequent options ignored.  If PERL5OPT begins with  <b>-t</b>, tainting will be enabled, a writable dot removed from @INC, and subsequent options honored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERLIO</dt>
<dd>
A space (or colon) separated list of PerlIO layers. If perl is built to use PerlIO system for IO (the default) these layers affect Perl's IO.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It is conventional to start layer names with a colon (for example, &quot;:perlio&quot;) to emphasize their similarity to variable &quot;attributes&quot;. But the code that parses layer specification strings,  which is also used to decode the PERLIO environment variable, treats the colon as a separator.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An unset or empty PERLIO is equivalent to the default set of layers for your platform; for example, &quot;:unix:perlio&quot; on Unix-like systems and &quot;:unix:crlf&quot; on Windows and other DOS-like systems.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The list becomes the default for <i>all</i> Perl's IO. Consequently only built-in layers can appear in this list, as external layers (such as &quot;:encoding()&quot;) need IO in  order to load them!. See &quot;open pragma&quot; for how to add external encodings as defaults.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Layers it makes sense to include in the PERLIO environment variable are briefly summarized below. For more details see PerlIO.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 12.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
:bytes</dt>
<dd>
A pseudolayer that turns the &quot;:utf8&quot; flag <i>off</i> for the layer below; unlikely to be useful on its own in the global PERLIO environment variable. You perhaps were thinking of &quot;:crlf:bytes&quot; or &quot;:perlio:bytes&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
:crlf</dt>
<dd>
A layer which does CRLF to &quot;\n&quot; translation distinguishing &quot;text&quot; and &quot;binary&quot; files in the manner of MS-DOS and similar operating systems. (It currently does  <i>not</i> mimic MS-DOS as far as treating of Control-Z as being an end-of-file marker.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
:mmap</dt>
<dd>
A layer that implements &quot;reading&quot; of files by using <i>mmap</i>(2) to make an entire file appear in the process's address space, and then using that as PerlIO's &quot;buffer&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
:perlio</dt>
<dd>
This is a re-implementation of stdio-like buffering written as a PerlIO layer.  As such it will call whatever layer is below it for its operations, typically &quot;:unix&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
:pop</dt>
<dd>
An experimental pseudolayer that removes the topmost layer. Use with the same care as is reserved for nitroglycerine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
:raw</dt>
<dd>
A pseudolayer that manipulates other layers.  Applying the &quot;:raw&quot; layer is equivalent to calling &quot;binmode($fh)&quot;.  It makes the stream pass each byte as-is without translation.  In particular, both CRLF translation and intuiting &quot;:utf8&quot; from the locale are disabled.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Unlike in earlier versions of Perl, &quot;:raw&quot; is <i>not</i> just the inverse of &quot;:crlf&quot;: other layers which would affect the binary nature of the stream are also removed or disabled.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
:stdio</dt>
<dd>
This layer provides a PerlIO interface by wrapping system's ANSI C &quot;stdio&quot; library calls. The layer provides both buffering and IO. Note that the &quot;:stdio&quot; layer does  <i>not</i> do CRLF translation even if that is the platform's normal behaviour. You will need a &quot;:crlf&quot; layer above it to do that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
:unix</dt>
<dd>
Low-level layer that calls &quot;read&quot;, &quot;write&quot;, &quot;lseek&quot;, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
:utf8</dt>
<dd>
A pseudolayer that enables a flag in the layer below to tell Perl that output should be in utf8 and that input should be regarded as already in valid utf8 form.  <b>WARNING: It does not check for validity and as such</b>  <b>should be handled with extreme caution for input, because security violations</b>  <b>can occur with non-shortest UTF-8 encodings, etc.</b> Generally &quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot; is the best option when reading UTF-8 encoded data.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
:win32</dt>
<dd>
On Win32 platforms this <i>experimental</i> layer uses native &quot;handle&quot; IO rather than a Unix-like numeric file descriptor layer. Known to be buggy in this release (5.14).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 12.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The default set of layers should give acceptable results on all platforms<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For Unix platforms that will be the equivalent of &quot;unix perlio&quot; or &quot;stdio&quot;. Configure is set up to prefer the &quot;stdio&quot; implementation if the system's library provides for fast access to the buffer; otherwise, it uses the &quot;unix perlio&quot; implementation.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On Win32 the default in this release (5.14) is &quot;unix crlf&quot;. Win32's &quot;stdio&quot; has a number of bugs/mis-features for Perl IO which are somewhat depending on the version and vendor of the C compiler. Using our own &quot;crlf&quot; layer as the buffer avoids those issues and makes things more uniform.  The &quot;crlf&quot; layer provides CRLF conversion as well as buffering.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This release (5.14) uses &quot;unix&quot; as the bottom layer on Win32, and so still uses the C compiler's numeric file descriptor routines. There is an experimental native &quot;win32&quot; layer, which is expected to be enhanced and should eventually become the default under Win32.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The PERLIO environment variable is completely ignored when Perl is run in taint mode.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
PERLIO_DEBUG</dt>
<dd>
If set to the name of a file or device, certain operations of PerlIO subsystem will be logged to that file, which is opened in append mode Typical uses are in Unix:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   % env PERLIO_DEBUG=/dev/tty perl script ...<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
and under Win32, the approximately equivalent:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   &gt; set PERLIO_DEBUG=CON<br/>
   perl script ...<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This functionality is disabled for setuid scripts and for scripts run with  <b>-T</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERLLIB</dt>
<dd>
A list of directories in which to look for Perl library files before looking in the standard library and the current directory. If PERL5LIB is defined, PERLLIB is not used.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The PERLLIB environment variable is completely ignored when Perl is run in taint mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL5DB</dt>
<dd>
The command used to load the debugger code.  The default is:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        BEGIN { require &quot;perl5db.pl&quot; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The PERL5DB environment variable is only used when Perl is started with a bare  <b>-d</b> switch.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL5DB_THREADED</dt>
<dd>
If set to a true value, indicates to the debugger that the code being debugged uses threads.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL5SHELL (specific to the Win32 port)</dt>
<dd>
On Win32 ports only, may be set to an alternative shell that Perl must use internally for executing &quot;backtick&quot; commands or  <i>system()</i>.  Default is &quot;cmd.exe /x/d/c&quot; on WindowsNT and &quot;command.com /c&quot; on Windows95.  The value is considered space-separated.  Precede any character that needs to be protected, like a space or backslash, with another backslash.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that Perl doesn't use COMSPEC for this purpose because COMSPEC has a high degree of variability among users, leading to portability concerns.  Besides, Perl can use a shell that may not be fit for interactive use, and setting COMSPEC to such a shell may interfere with the proper functioning of other programs (which usually look in COMSPEC to find a shell fit for interactive use).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Before Perl 5.10.0 and 5.8.8, PERL5SHELL was not taint checked when running external commands.  It is recommended that you explicitly set (or delete) $ENV{PERL5SHELL} when running in taint mode under Windows.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL_ALLOW_NON_IFS_LSP (specific to the Win32 port)</dt>
<dd>
Set to 1 to allow the use of non-IFS compatible LSPs (Layered Service Providers). Perl normally searches for an IFS-compatible LSP because this is required for its emulation of Windows sockets as real filehandles.  However, this may cause problems if you have a firewall such as  <i>McAfee Guardian</i>, which requires that all applications use its LSP but which is not IFS-compatible, because clearly Perl will normally avoid using such an LSP.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Setting this environment variable to 1 means that Perl will simply use the first suitable LSP enumerated in the catalog, which keeps  <i>McAfee Guardian</i> happy--and in that particular case Perl still works too because  <i>McAfee</i>  <i>Guardian</i>'s LSP actually plays other games which allow applications requiring IFS compatibility to work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS</dt>
<dd>
Relevant only if Perl is compiled with the &quot;malloc&quot; included with the Perl distribution; that is, if &quot;perl -V:d_mymalloc&quot; is &quot;define&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If set, this dumps out memory statistics after execution.  If set to an integer greater than one, also dumps out memory statistics after compilation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</dt>
<dd>
Relevant only if your Perl executable was built with <b>-DDEBUGGING</b>, this controls the behaviour of global destruction of objects and other references.  See &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot; in perlhacktips for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL_DL_NONLAZY</dt>
<dd>
Set to &quot;1&quot; to have Perl resolve <i>all</i> undefined symbols when it loads a dynamic library.  The default behaviour is to resolve symbols when they are used.  Setting this variable is useful during testing of extensions, as it ensures that you get an error on misspelled function names even if the test suite doesn't call them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL_ENCODING</dt>
<dd>
If using the &quot;use encoding&quot; pragma without an explicit encoding name, the PERL_ENCODING environment variable is consulted for an encoding name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL_HASH_SEED</dt>
<dd>
(Since Perl 5.8.1.)  Used to randomize Perl's internal hash function. To emulate the pre-5.8.1 behaviour, set to an integer; &quot;0&quot; means exactly the same order as in 5.8.0.  &quot;Pre-5.8.1&quot; means, among other things, that hash keys will always have the same ordering between different runs of Perl.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Most hashes by default return elements in the same order as in Perl 5.8.0. On a hash by hash basis, if pathological data is detected during a hash key insertion, then that hash will switch to an alternative random hash seed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The default behaviour is to randomize unless the PERL_HASH_SEED is set. If Perl has been compiled with  <b>-DUSE_HASH_SEED_EXPLICIT</b>, the default behaviour is  <i>not</i> to randomize unless the PERL_HASH_SEED is set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If PERL_HASH_SEED is unset or set to a non-numeric string, Perl uses the pseudorandom seed supplied by the operating system and libraries.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>PLEASE NOTE: The hash seed is sensitive information</b>. Hashes are randomized to protect against local and remote attacks against Perl code. By manually setting a seed, this protection may be partially or completely lost.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec and &quot;PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG&quot; for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG</dt>
<dd>
(Since Perl 5.8.1.)  Set to &quot;1&quot; to display (to STDERR) the value of the hash seed at the beginning of execution.  This, combined with &quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot; is intended to aid in debugging nondeterministic behaviour caused by hash randomization.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Note that the hash seed is sensitive information</b>: by knowing it, one can craft a denial-of-service attack against Perl code, even remotely; see &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec for more information.  <b>Do not disclose the hash seed</b> to people who don't need to know it. See also  <i>hash_seed()</i> in Hash::Util.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL_MEM_LOG</dt>
<dd>
If your Perl was configured with <b>-Accflags=-DPERL_MEM_LOG</b>, setting the environment variable &quot;PERL_MEM_LOG&quot; enables logging debug messages. The value has the form &quot;&lt; <i>number</i>&gt;[m][s][t]&quot;, where &quot; <i>number</i>&quot; is the file descriptor number you want to write to (2 is default), and the combination of letters specifies that you want information about (m)emory and/or (s)v, optionally with (t)imestamps. For example, &quot;PERL_MEM_LOG=1mst&quot; logs all information to stdout. You can write to other opened file descriptors in a variety of ways:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  $ 3&gt;foo3 PERL_MEM_LOG=3m perl ...<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL_ROOT (specific to the VMS port)</dt>
<dd>
A translation-concealed rooted logical name that contains Perl and the logical device for the @INC path on VMS only.  Other logical names that affect Perl on VMS include PERLSHR, PERL_ENV_TABLES, and SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL, but are optional and discussed further in perlvms and in  <i>README.vms</i> in the Perl source distribution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL_SIGNALS</dt>
<dd>
Available in Perls 5.8.1 and later.  If set to &quot;unsafe&quot;, the pre-Perl-5.8.0 signal behaviour (which is immediate but unsafe) is restored.  If set to &quot;safe&quot;, then safe (but deferred) signals are used.  See &quot;Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)&quot; in perlipc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL_UNICODE</dt>
<dd>
Equivalent to the <b>-C</b> command-line switch.  Note that this is not a boolean variable. Setting this to &quot;1&quot; is not the right way to &quot;enable Unicode&quot; (whatever that would mean).  You can use &quot;0&quot; to &quot;disable Unicode&quot;, though (or alternatively unset PERL_UNICODE in your shell before starting Perl).  See the description of the  <b>-C</b> switch for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
SYS$LOGIN (specific to the VMS port)</dt>
<dd>
Used if chdir has no argument and HOME and LOGDIR are not set.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl also has environment variables that control how Perl handles data specific to particular natural languages; see perllocale.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl and its various modules and components, including its test frameworks, may sometimes make use of certain other environment variables.  Some of these are specific to a particular platform.  Please consult the appropriate module documentation and any documentation for your platform (like perlsolaris, perllinux, perlmacosx, perlwin32, etc) for variables peculiar to those specific situations.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl makes all environment variables available to the program being executed, and passes these along to any child processes it starts. However, programs running setuid would do well to execute the following lines before doing anything else, just to keep people honest:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $ENV{PATH}  = &quot;/bin:/usr/bin&quot;;    # or whatever you need<br/>
