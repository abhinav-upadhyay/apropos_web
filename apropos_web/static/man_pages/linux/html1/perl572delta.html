<h1>NAME</h1> perl572delta - what's new for perl v5.7.2</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.7.1 release and the 5.7.2 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
(To view the differences between the 5.6.0 release and the 5.7.0 release, see perl570delta.  To view the differences between the 5.7.0 release and the 5.7.1 release, see perl571delta.)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Security Vulnerability Closed</h1> (This change was already made in 5.7.0 but bears repeating here.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
A security vulnerability affecting all Perl versions prior to 5.6.1 was found in August 2000.  The vulnerability does not affect default installations and as far as is known affects only the Linux platform.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You should upgrade your Perl to 5.6.1 as soon as possible.  Patches for earlier releases exist but using the patches require full recompilation from the source code anyway, so 5.6.1 is your best choice.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/sperl-2000-08-05.txt for more information.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>64-bit platforms and malloc</h2> If your pointers are 64 bits wide, the Perl malloc is no more being used because it simply does not work with 8-byte pointers.  Also, usually the system malloc on such platforms are much better optimized for such large memory models than the Perl malloc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>AIX Dynaloading</h2> The AIX dynaloading now uses in AIX releases 4.3 and newer the native dlopen interface of AIX instead of the old emulated interface.  This change will probably break backward compatibility with compiled modules.  The change was made to make Perl more compliant with other applications like modperl which are using the AIX native interface.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Socket Extension Dynamic in VMS</h2> The Socket extension is now dynamically loaded instead of being statically built in.  This may or may not be a problem with ancient TCP/IP stacks of VMS: we do not know since we weren't able to test Perl in such configurations.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Different Definition of the Unicode Character Classes \p{In...}</h2> As suggested by the Unicode consortium, the Unicode character classes now prefer  <i>scripts</i> as opposed to <i>blocks</i> (as defined by Unicode); in Perl, when the &quot;\p{In....}&quot; and the &quot;\p{In....}&quot; regular expression constructs are used.  This has changed the definition of some of those character classes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The difference between scripts and blocks is that scripts are the glyphs used by a language or a group of languages, while the blocks are more artificial groupings of 256 characters based on the Unicode numbering.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In general this change results in more inclusive Unicode character classes, but changes to the other direction also do take place: for example while the script &quot;Latin&quot; includes all the Latin characters and their various diacritic-adorned versions, it does not include the various punctuation or digits (since they are not solely &quot;Latin&quot;).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Changes in the character class semantics may have happened if a script and a block happen to have the same name, for example &quot;Hebrew&quot;. In such cases the script wins and &quot;\p{InHebrew}&quot; now means the script definition of Hebrew.  The block definition in still available, though, by appending &quot;Block&quot; to the name: &quot;\p{InHebrewBlock}&quot; means what &quot;\p{InHebrew}&quot; meant in perl 5.6.0.  For the full list of affected character classes, see &quot;Blocks&quot; in perlunicode.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Deprecations</h2> The current user-visible implementation of pseudo-hashes (the weird use of the first array element) is deprecated starting from Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in Perl 5.10.0, and the feature will be implemented differently.  Not only is the current interface rather ugly, but the current implementation slows down normal array and hash use quite noticeably. The &quot;fields&quot; pragma interface will remain available.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The syntaxes &quot;@a-&gt;[...]&quot; and  &quot;@h-&gt;{...}&quot; have now been deprecated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The suidperl is also considered to be too much a risk to continue maintaining and the suidperl code is likely to be removed in a future release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;package;&quot; syntax (&quot;package&quot; without an argument has been deprecated.  Its semantics were never that clear and its implementation even less so.  If you have used that feature to disallow all but fully qualified variables, &quot;use strict;&quot; instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The chdir(undef) and chdir('') behaviors to match <i>chdir()</i> has been deprecated.  In future versions, chdir(undef) and chdir('') will simply fail.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1> In general a lot of fixing has happened in the area of Perl's understanding of numbers, both integer and floating point.  Since in many systems the standard number parsing functions like &quot;strtoul()&quot; and &quot;atof()&quot; seem to have bugs, Perl tries to work around their deficiencies.  This results hopefully in more accurate numbers.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The rules for allowing underscores (underbars) in numeric constants have been relaxed and simplified: now you can have an underscore  <b>between digits</b>.</dd>

Lexicals I: lexicals outside an eval &quot;&quot; weren't resolved correctly inside a subroutine definition inside the eval &quot;&quot; if they were not already referenced in the top level of the eval&quot;&quot;ed code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Lexicals II: lexicals leaked at file scope into subroutines that were declared before the lexicals.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
Lvalue subroutines can now return &quot;undef&quot; in list context.</dd>

<dd>
A new special regular expression variable has been introduced: $^N, which contains the most-recently closed group (submatch).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
utime now supports &quot;utime undef, undef, @files&quot; to change the file timestamps to the current time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The Perl parser has been stress tested using both random input and Markov chain input.</dd>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
VMS now works under PerlIO.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
END blocks are now run even if you exit/die in a BEGIN block. The execution of END blocks is now controlled by PL_exit_flags &amp; PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END. This enables the new behaviour for perl embedders. This will default in 5.10. See perlembed.</dd>

h2xs uses the new ExtUtils::Constant module which will affect newly created extensions that define constants.  Since the new code is more correct (if you have two constants where the first one is a prefix of the second one, the first constant  <b>never</b> gets defined), less lossy (it uses integers for integer constant, as opposed to the old code that used floating point numbers even for integer constants), and slightly faster, you might want to consider regenerating your extension code (the new scheme makes regenerating easy). h2xs now also supports C trigraphs.</dd>

The behaviour of non-decimal but numeric string constants such as &quot;0x23&quot; was platform-dependent: in some platforms that was seen as 35, in some as 0, in some as a floating point number (don't ask).  This was caused by Perl using the operating system libraries in a situation where the result of the string to number conversion is undefined: now Perl consistently handles such strings as zero in numeric contexts.</dd>

In AIX 4.2 Perl extensions that use C++ functions that use statics may have problems in that the statics are not getting initialized. In newer AIX releases this has been solved by linking Perl with the libC_r library, but unfortunately in AIX 4.2 the said library has an obscure bug where the various functions related to time (such as  <i>time()</i> and <i>gettimeofday()</i>) return broken values, and therefore in AIX 4.2 Perl is not linked against the libC_r.</dd>

vac 5.0.0.0 May Produce Buggy Code For Perl<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The AIX C compiler vac version 5.0.0.0 may produce buggy code, resulting in few random tests failing, but when the failing tests are run by hand, they succeed.  We suggest upgrading to at least vac version 5.0.1.0, that has been known to compile Perl correctly. &quot;lslpp -L|grep vac.C&quot; will tell you the vac version.</dd>

<h2>HP-UX lib/io_multihomed Fails When LP64-Configured</h2> The lib/io_multihomed test may hang in HP-UX if Perl has been configured to be 64-bit. Because other 64-bit platforms do not hang in this test, HP-UX is suspect. All other tests pass in 64-bit HP-UX.

<h2>op/sprintf tests 129 and 130</h2> The op/sprintf tests 129 and 130 are known to fail on some platforms. Examples include any platform using sfio, and Compaq/Tandem's NonStop-UX. The failing platforms do not comply with the ANSI C Standard, line 19ff on page 134 of ANSI X3.159 1989 to be exact.  (They produce something other than &quot;1&quot; and &quot;-1&quot; when formatting 0.6 and -0.6 using the printf format &quot;%.0f&quot;, most often they produce &quot;0&quot; and &quot;-0&quot;.)</div>

<h2>Self-tying of Arrays and Hashes Is Forbidden</h2> Self-tying of arrays and hashes is broken in rather deep and hard-to-fix ways.  As a stop-gap measure to avoid people from getting frustrated at the mysterious results (core dumps, most often) it is for now forbidden (you will get a fatal error even from an attempt).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Variable Attributes are not Currently Usable for Tying</h2> This limitation will hopefully be fixed in future.  (Subroutine attributes work fine for tying, see Attribute::Handlers).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles</h2> Some extensions like mod_perl are known to have issues with `largefiles', a change brought by Perl 5.6.0 in which file offsets default to 64 bits wide, where supported.  Modules may fail to compile at all or compile and work incorrectly.  Currently there is no good solution for the problem, but Configure now provides appropriate non-largefile ccflags, ldflags, libswanted, and libs in the %Config hash (e.g., $Config{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the extensions that are having problems can try configuring themselves without the largefileness.  This is admittedly not a clean solution, and the solution may not even work at all.  One potential failure is whether one can (or, if one can, whether it's a good idea) link together at all binaries with different ideas about file offsets, all this is platform-dependent.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The Compiler Suite Is Still Experimental</h2> The compiler suite is slowly getting better but is nowhere near working order yet.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The Long Double Support is Still Experimental</h2> The ability to configure Perl's numbers to use &quot;long doubles&quot;, floating point numbers of hopefully better accuracy, is still experimental.  The implementations of long doubles are not yet widespread and the existing implementations are not quite mature or standardised, therefore trying to support them is a rare and moving target.  The gain of more precision may also be offset by slowdown in computations (more bits to move around, and the operations are more likely to be executed by less optimised libraries).</div>
