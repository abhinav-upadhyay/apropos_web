<h1>NAME</h1> perl561delta - what's new for perl v5.6.x</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.005 release and the 5.6.1 release.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Summary of changes between 5.6.0 and 5.6.1</h1> This section contains a summary of the changes between the 5.6.0 release and the 5.6.1 release.  More details about the changes mentioned here may be found in the  <i>Changes</i> files that accompany the Perl source distribution.  See perlhack for pointers to online resources where you can inspect the individual patches described by these changes.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Security Issues</h2> suidperl will not run /bin/mail anymore, because some platforms have a /bin/mail that is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that suidperl is neither built nor installed by default in any recent version of perl.  Use of suidperl is highly discouraged. If you think you need it, try alternatives such as sudo first. See http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ .</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Core bug fixes</h2> This is not an exhaustive list.  It is intended to cover only the significant user-visible changes.<dl>
<dt>
&quot;UNIVERSAL::isa()&quot;</dt>
<dd>
A bug in the caching mechanism used by &quot;UNIVERSAL::isa()&quot; that affected base.pm has been fixed.  The bug has existed since the 5.005 releases, but wasn't tickled by base.pm in those releases.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Memory leaks</dt>
<dd>
Various cases of memory leaks and attempts to access uninitialized memory have been cured.  See &quot;Known Problems&quot; below for further issues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Numeric conversions</dt>
<dd>
Numeric conversions did not recognize changes in the string value properly in certain circumstances.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In other situations, large unsigned numbers (those above 2**31) could sometimes lose their unsignedness, causing bogus results in arithmetic operations.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Integer modulus on large unsigned integers sometimes returned incorrect values.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl 5.6.0 generated &quot;not a number&quot; warnings on certain conversions where previous versions didn't.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
These problems have all been rectified.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Infinity is now recognized as a number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
qw(a\\b)</dt>
<dd>
In Perl 5.6.0, qw(a\\b) produced a string with two backslashes instead of one, in a departure from the behavior in previous versions.  The older behavior has been reinstated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>caller()</i></dt>
<dd>
<i>caller()</i> could cause core dumps in certain situations.  Carp was sometimes affected by this problem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bugs in regular expressions</dt>
<dd>
Pattern matches on overloaded values are now handled correctly.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl 5.6.0 parsed m/\x{ab}/ incorrectly, leading to spurious warnings. This has been corrected.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The RE engine found in Perl 5.6.0 accidentally pessimised certain kinds of simple pattern matches.  These are now handled better.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Regular expression debug output (whether through &quot;use re 'debug'&quot; or via &quot;-Dr&quot;) now looks better.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Multi-line matches like &quot;&quot;a\nxb\n&quot; =~ /(?!\A)x/m&quot; were flawed.  The bug has been fixed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use of $&amp; could trigger a core dump under some situations.  This is now avoided.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Match variables $1 et al., weren't being unset when a pattern match was backtracking, and the anomaly showed up inside &quot;/...(?{ ... }).../&quot; etc.  These variables are now tracked correctly.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>pos()</i> did not return the correct value within s///ge in earlier versions.  This is now handled correctly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;slurp&quot; mode</dt>
<dd>
<i>readline()</i> on files opened in &quot;slurp&quot; mode could return an extra &quot;&quot; at the end in certain situations.  This has been corrected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Autovivification of symbolic references to special variables</dt>
<dd>
Autovivification of symbolic references of special variables described in perlvar (as in &quot;${$num}&quot;) was accidentally disabled.  This works again now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Lexical warnings</dt>
<dd>
Lexical warnings now propagate correctly into &quot;eval &quot;...&quot;&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;use warnings qw(FATAL all)&quot; did not work as intended.  This has been corrected.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Lexical warnings could leak into other scopes in some situations. This is now fixed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>warnings::enabled()</i> now reports the state of $^W correctly if the caller isn't using lexical warnings.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Spurious warnings and errors</dt>
<dd>
Perl 5.6.0 could emit spurious warnings about redefinition of <i>dl_error()</i> when statically building extensions into perl.  This has been corrected.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;our&quot; variables could result in bogus &quot;Variable will not stay shared&quot; warnings.  This is now fixed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;our&quot; variables of the same name declared in two sibling blocks resulted in bogus warnings about &quot;redeclaration&quot; of the variables. The problem has been corrected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>glob()</i></dt>
<dd>
Compatibility of the builtin <i>glob()</i> with old csh-based glob has been improved with the addition of GLOB_ALPHASORT option.  See &quot;File::Glob&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>File::Glob::glob()</i> has been renamed to <i>File::Glob::bsd_glob()</i> because the name clashes with the builtin  <i>glob()</i>.  The older name is still available for compatibility, but is deprecated.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Spurious syntax errors generated in certain situations, when <i>glob()</i> caused File::Glob to be loaded for the first time, have been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Tainting</dt>
<dd>
Some cases of inconsistent taint propagation (such as within hash values) have been fixed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The tainting behavior of <i>sprintf()</i> has been rationalized.  It does not taint the result of floating point formats anymore, making the behavior consistent with that of string interpolation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>sort()</i></dt>
<dd>
Arguments to <i>sort()</i> weren't being provided the right <i>wantarray()</i> context. The comparison block is now run in scalar context, and the arguments to be sorted are always provided list context.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>sort()</i> is also fully reentrant, in the sense that the sort function can itself call  <i>sort()</i>.  This did not work reliably in previous releases.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
#line directives</dt>
<dd>
#line directives now work correctly when they appear at the very beginning of &quot;eval &quot;...&quot;&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Subroutine prototypes</dt>
<dd>
The (\&amp;) prototype now works properly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>map()</i></dt>
<dd>
<i>map()</i> could get pathologically slow when the result list it generates is larger than the source list.  The performance has been improved for common scenarios.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Debugger</dt>
<dd>
Debugger exit code now reflects the script exit code.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Condition &quot;0&quot; in breakpoints is now treated correctly.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The &quot;d&quot; command now checks the line number.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
$. is no longer corrupted by the debugger.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
All debugger output now correctly goes to the socket if RemotePort is set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PERL5OPT</dt>
<dd>
PERL5OPT can be set to more than one switch group.  Previously, it used to be limited to one group of options only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>chop()</i></dt>
<dd>
chop(@list) in list context returned the characters chopped in reverse order.  This has been reversed to be in the right order.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Unicode support</dt>
<dd>
Unicode support has seen a large number of incremental improvements, but continues to be highly experimental.  It is not expected to be fully supported in the 5.6.x maintenance releases.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>substr()</i>, <i>join()</i>, <i>repeat()</i>, <i>reverse()</i>, <i>quotemeta()</i> and string concatenation were all handling Unicode strings incorrectly in Perl 5.6.0.  This has been corrected.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Support for &quot;tr///CU&quot; and &quot;tr///UC&quot; etc., have been removed since we realized the interface is broken.  For similar functionality, see &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The Unicode Character Database has been updated to version 3.0.1 with additions made available to the public as of August 30, 2000.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The Unicode character classes \p{Blank} and \p{SpacePerl} have been added.  &quot;Blank&quot; is like C  <i>isblank()</i>, that is, it contains only &quot;horizontal whitespace&quot; (the space character is, the newline isn't), and the &quot;SpacePerl&quot; is the Unicode equivalent of &quot;\s&quot; (\p{Space} isn't, since that includes the vertical tabulator character, whereas &quot;\s&quot; doesn't.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you are experimenting with Unicode support in perl, the development versions of Perl may have more to offer.  In particular, I/O layers are now available in the development track, but not in the maintenance track, primarily to do backward compatibility issues.  Unicode support is also evolving rapidly on a daily basis in the development track--the maintenance track only reflects the most conservative of these changes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
64-bit support</dt>
<dd>
Support for 64-bit platforms has been improved, but continues to be experimental.  The level of support varies greatly among platforms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Compiler</dt>
<dd>
The B Compiler and its various backends have had many incremental improvements, but they continue to remain highly experimental.  Use in production environments is discouraged.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The perlcc tool has been rewritten so that the user interface is much more like that of a C compiler.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The perlbc tools has been removed.  Use &quot;perlcc -B&quot; instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Lvalue subroutines</dt>
<dd>
There have been various bugfixes to support lvalue subroutines better. However, the feature still remains experimental.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
IO::Socket</dt>
<dd>
IO::Socket::INET failed to open the specified port if the service name was not known.  It now correctly uses the supplied port number as is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
File::Find</dt>
<dd>
File::Find now <i>chdir()</i>s correctly when chasing symbolic links.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
xsubpp</dt>
<dd>
xsubpp now tolerates embedded POD sections.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;no Module;&quot;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;no Module;&quot; does not produce an error even if Module does not have an  <i>unimport()</i> method.  This parallels the behavior of &quot;use&quot; vis-a-vis &quot;import&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Tests</dt>
<dd>
A large number of tests have been added.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Core features</h2>  <i>untie()</i> will now call an <i>UNTIE()</i> hook if it exists.  See perltie for details.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;-DT&quot; command line switch outputs copious tokenizing information. See perlrun.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Arrays are now always interpolated in double-quotish strings.  Previously, &quot;foo@bar.com&quot; used to be a fatal error at compile time, if an array @bar was not used or declared.  This transitional behavior was intended to help migrate perl4 code, and is deemed to be no longer useful. See &quot;Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>keys()</i>, <i>each()</i>, <i>pop()</i>, <i>push()</i>, <i>shift()</i>, <i>splice()</i> and <i>unshift()</i> can all be overridden now.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;my __PACKAGE__ $obj&quot; now does the expected thing.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Configuration issues</h2> On some systems (IRIX and Solaris among them) the system malloc is demonstrably better.  While the defaults haven't been changed in order to retain binary compatibility with earlier releases, you may be better off building perl with &quot;Configure -Uusemymalloc ...&quot; as discussed in the  <i>INSTALL</i> file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;Configure&quot; has been enhanced in various ways:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Minimizes use of temporary files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
By default, does not link perl with libraries not used by it, such as the various dbm libraries.  SunOS 4.x hints preserve behavior on that platform.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Support for pdp11-style memory models has been removed due to obsolescence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Building outside the source tree is supported on systems that have symbolic links. This is done by running<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sh /path/to/source/Configure -Dmksymlinks ...<br/>
    make all test install<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
in a directory other than the perl source directory.  See <i>INSTALL</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;Configure -S&quot; can be run non-interactively.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Documentation</h2> README.aix, README.solaris and README.macos have been added. README.posix-bc has been renamed to README.bs2000.  These are installed as perlaix, perlsolaris, perlmacos, and perlbs2000 respectively.<div class="spacer">

Unless specifically qualified otherwise, the remainder of this document covers changes between the 5.005 and 5.6.0 releases.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Interpreter cloning, threads, and concurrency</h2> Perl 5.6.0 introduces the beginnings of support for running multiple interpreters concurrently in different threads.  In conjunction with the  <i>perl_clone()</i> API call, which can be used to selectively duplicate the state of any given interpreter, it is possible to compile a piece of code once in an interpreter, clone that interpreter one or more times, and run all the resulting interpreters in distinct threads.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On the Windows platform, this feature is used to emulate <i>fork()</i> at the interpreter level.  See perlfork for details about that.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This feature is still in evolution.  It is eventually meant to be used to selectively clone a subroutine and data reachable from that subroutine in a separate interpreter and run the cloned subroutine in a separate thread.  Since there is no shared data between the interpreters, little or no locking will be needed (unless parts of the symbol table are explicitly shared).  This is obviously intended to be an easy-to-use replacement for the existing threads support.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Support for cloning interpreters and interpreter concurrency can be enabled using the -Dusethreads Configure option (see win32/Makefile for how to enable it on Windows.)  The resulting perl executable will be functionally identical to one that was built with -Dmultiplicity, but the  <i>perl_clone()</i> API call will only be available in the former.<div class="spacer">
</div>
-Dusethreads enables the cpp macro USE_ITHREADS by default, which in turn enables Perl source code changes that provide a clear separation between the op tree and the data it operates with.  The former is immutable, and can therefore be shared between an interpreter and all of its clones, while the latter is considered local to each interpreter, and is therefore copied for each clone.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that building Perl with the -Dusemultiplicity Configure option is adequate if you wish to run multiple  <b>independent</b> interpreters concurrently in different threads.  -Dusethreads only provides the additional functionality of the  <i>perl_clone()</i> API call and other support for running  <b>cloned</b> interpreters concurrently.<div class="spacer">
</div>

    NOTE: This is an experimental feature.  Implementation details are<br/>
    subject to change.<br/>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Lexically scoped warning categories</h2> You can now control the granularity of warnings emitted by perl at a finer level using the &quot;use warnings&quot; pragma.  warnings and perllexwarn have copious documentation on this feature.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode and UTF-8 support</h2> Perl now uses UTF-8 as its internal representation for character strings.  The &quot;utf8&quot; and &quot;bytes&quot; pragmas are used to control this support in the current lexical scope.  See perlunicode, utf8 and bytes for more information.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This feature is expected to evolve quickly to support some form of I/O disciplines that can be used to specify the kind of input and output data (bytes or characters).  Until that happens, additional modules from CPAN will be needed to complete the toolkit for dealing with Unicode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    NOTE: This should be considered an experimental feature.  Implementation<br/>
    details are subject to change.<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Support for interpolating named characters</h2> The new &quot;\N&quot; escape interpolates named characters within strings. For example, &quot;Hi! \N{WHITE SMILING FACE}&quot; evaluates to a string with a Unicode smiley face at the end.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;our&quot; declarations</h2> An &quot;our&quot; declaration introduces a value that can be best understood as a lexically scoped symbolic alias to a global variable in the package that was current where the variable was declared.  This is mostly useful as an alternative to the &quot;vars&quot; pragma, but also provides the opportunity to introduce typing and other attributes for such variables.  See &quot;our&quot; in perlfunc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals</h2> Literals of the form &quot;v1.2.3.4&quot; are now parsed as a string composed of characters with the specified ordinals.  This is an alternative, more readable way to construct (possibly Unicode) strings instead of interpolating characters, as in &quot;\x{1}\x{2}\x{3}\x{4}&quot;.  The leading &quot;v&quot; may be omitted if there are more than two ordinals, so 1.2.3 is parsed the same as &quot;v1.2.3&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Strings written in this form are also useful to represent version &quot;numbers&quot;. It is easy to compare such version &quot;numbers&quot; (which are really just plain strings) using any of the usual string comparison operators &quot;eq&quot;, &quot;ne&quot;, &quot;lt&quot;, &quot;gt&quot;, etc., or perform bitwise string operations on them using &quot;|&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, etc.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In conjunction with the new $^V magic variable (which contains the perl version as a string), such literals can be used as a readable way to check if you're running a particular version of Perl:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    # this will parse in older versions of Perl also<br/>
    if ($^V and $^V gt v5.6.0) {<br/>
        # new features supported<br/>
    }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;require&quot; and &quot;use&quot; also have some special magic to support such literals. They will be interpreted as a version rather than as a module name:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    require v5.6.0;             # croak if $^V lt v5.6.0<br/>
    use v5.6.0;                 # same, but croaks at compile-time<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Alternatively, the &quot;v&quot; may be omitted if there is more than one dot:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    require 5.6.0;<br/>
    use 5.6.0;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Also, &quot;sprintf&quot; and &quot;printf&quot; support the Perl-specific format flag %v to print ordinals of characters in arbitrary strings:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    printf &quot;v%vd&quot;, $^V;         # prints current version, such as &quot;v5.5.650&quot;<br/>
    printf &quot;%*vX&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, $addr;  # formats IPv6 address<br/>
    printf &quot;%*vb&quot;, &quot; &quot;, $bits;  # displays bitstring<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;Scalar value constructors&quot; in perldata for additional information.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Improved Perl version numbering system</h2> Beginning with Perl version 5.6.0, the version number convention has been changed to a &quot;dotted integer&quot; scheme that is more commonly found in open source projects.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Maintenance versions of v5.6.0 will be released as v5.6.1, v5.6.2 etc. The next development series following v5.6.0 will be numbered v5.7.x, beginning with v5.7.0, and the next major production release following v5.6.0 will be v5.8.0.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The English module now sets $PERL_VERSION to $^V (a string value) rather than $] (a numeric value).  (This is a potential incompatibility. Send us a report via perlbug if you are affected by this.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The v1.2.3 syntax is also now legal in Perl. See &quot;Support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals&quot; for more on that.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To cope with the new versioning system's use of at least three significant digits for each version component, the method used for incrementing the subversion number has also changed slightly.  We assume that versions older than v5.6.0 have been incrementing the subversion component in multiples of 10.  Versions after v5.6.0 will increment them by 1.  Thus, using the new notation, 5.005_03 is the &quot;same&quot; as v5.5.30, and the first maintenance version following v5.6.0 will be v5.6.1 (which should be read as being equivalent to a floating point value of 5.006_001 in the older format, stored in $]).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New syntax for declaring subroutine attributes</h2> Formerly, if you wanted to mark a subroutine as being a method call or as requiring an automatic  <i>lock()</i> when it is entered, you had to declare that with a &quot;use attrs&quot; pragma in the body of the subroutine. That can now be accomplished with declaration syntax, like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    sub mymethod : locked method;<br/>
    ...<br/>
    sub mymethod : locked method {<br/>
        ...<br/>
    }<br/>
<br/>
    sub othermethod :locked :method;<br/>
    ...<br/>
    sub othermethod :locked :method {<br/>
        ...<br/>
    }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(Note how only the first &quot;:&quot; is mandatory, and whitespace surrounding the &quot;:&quot; is optional.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>AutoSplit.pm</i> and <i>SelfLoader.pm</i> have been updated to keep the attributes with the stubs they provide.  See attributes.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>File and directory handles can be autovivified</h2> Similar to how constructs such as &quot;$x-&gt;[0]&quot; autovivify a reference, handle constructors ( <i>open()</i>, <i>opendir()</i>, <i>pipe()</i>, <i>socketpair()</i>, <i>sysopen()</i>,  <i>socket()</i>, and <i>accept()</i>) now autovivify a file or directory handle if the handle passed to them is an uninitialized scalar variable.  This allows the constructs such as &quot;open(my $fh, ...)&quot; and &quot;open(local $fh,...)&quot; to be used to create filehandles that will conveniently be closed automatically when the scope ends, provided there are no other references to them.  This largely eliminates the need for typeglobs when opening filehandles that must be passed around, as in the following example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    sub myopen {<br/>
        open my $fh, &quot;@_&quot;<br/>
             or die &quot;Can't open '@_': $!&quot;;<br/>
        return $fh;<br/>
    }<br/>
<br/>
    {<br/>
        my $f = myopen(&quot;&lt;/etc/motd&quot;);<br/>
        print &lt;$f&gt;;<br/>
        # $f implicitly closed here<br/>
    }<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>open()</i> with more than two arguments</h2> If  <i>open()</i> is passed three arguments instead of two, the second argument is used as the mode and the third argument is taken to be the file name. This is primarily useful for protecting against unintended magic behavior of the traditional two-argument form.  See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>64-bit support</h2> Any platform that has 64-bit integers either<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        (1) natively as longs or ints<br/>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>vec()</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that unless you have the case (a) you will have to configure and compile Perl using the -Duse64bitint Configure flag.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    NOTE: The Configure flags -Duselonglong and -Duse64bits have been<br/>
    deprecated.  Use -Duse64bitint instead.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are actually two modes of 64-bitness: the first one is achieved using Configure -Duse64bitint and the second one using Configure -Duse64bitall.  The difference is that the first one is minimal and the second one maximal.  The first works in more places than the second.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;use64bitint&quot; does only as much as is required to get 64-bit integers into Perl (this may mean, for example, using &quot;long longs&quot;) while your memory may still be limited to 2 gigabytes (because your pointers could still be 32-bit).  Note that the name &quot;64bitint&quot; does not imply that your C compiler will be using 64-bit &quot;int&quot;s (it might, but it doesn't have to): the &quot;use64bitint&quot; means that you will be able to have 64 bits wide scalar values.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;use64bitall&quot; goes all the way by attempting to switch also integers (if it can), longs (and pointers) to being 64-bit.  This may create an even more binary incompatible Perl than -Duse64bitint: the resulting executable may not run at all in a 32-bit box, or you may have to reboot/reconfigure/rebuild your operating system to be 64-bit aware.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Natively 64-bit systems like Alpha and Cray need neither -Duse64bitint nor -Duse64bitall.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Last but not least: note that due to Perl's habit of always using floating point numbers, the quads are still not true integers. When quads overflow their limits (0...18_446_744_073_709_551_615 unsigned, -9_223_372_036_854_775_808...9_223_372_036_854_775_807 signed), they are silently promoted to floating point numbers, after which they will start losing precision (in their lower digits).<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    NOTE: 64-bit support is still experimental on most platforms.<br/>
    Existing support only covers the LP64 data model.  In particular, the<br/>
    LLP64 data model is not yet supported.  64-bit libraries and system<br/>
    APIs on many platforms have not stabilized--your mileage may vary.<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Large file support</h2> If you have filesystems that support &quot;large files&quot; (files larger than 2 gigabytes), you may now also be able to create and access them from Perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    NOTE: The default action is to enable large file support, if<br/>
    available on the platform.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the large file support is on, and you have a Fcntl constant O_LARGEFILE, the O_LARGEFILE is automatically added to the flags of  <i>sysopen()</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Beware that unless your filesystem also supports &quot;sparse files&quot; seeking to umpteen petabytes may be inadvisable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that in addition to requiring a proper file system to do large files you may also need to adjust your per-process (or your per-system, or per-process-group, or per-user-group) maximum filesize limits before running Perl scripts that try to handle large files, especially if you intend to write such files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Finally, in addition to your process/process group maximum filesize limits, you may have quota limits on your filesystems that stop you (your user id or your user group id) from using large files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Adjusting your process/user/group/file system/operating system limits is outside the scope of Perl core language.  For process limits, you may try increasing the limits using your shell's limits/limit/ulimit command before running Perl.  The BSD::Resource extension (not included with the standard Perl distribution) may also be of use, it offers the getrlimit/setrlimit interface that can be used to adjust process resource usage limits, including the maximum filesize limit.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Long doubles</h2> In some systems you may be able to use long doubles to enhance the range and precision of your double precision floating point numbers (that is, Perl's numbers).  Use Configure -Duselongdouble to enable this support (if it is available).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;more bits&quot;</h2> You can &quot;Configure -Dusemorebits&quot; to turn on both the 64-bit support and the long double support.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Enhanced support for <i>sort()</i> subroutines</h2> Perl subroutines with a prototype of &quot;($$)&quot;, and XSUBs in general, can now be used as sort subroutines.  In either case, the two elements to be compared are passed as normal parameters in @_.  See &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For unprototyped sort subroutines, the historical behavior of passing the elements to be compared as the global variables $a and $b remains unchanged.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;sort $coderef @foo&quot; allowed</h2>  <i>sort()</i> did not accept a subroutine reference as the comparison function in earlier versions.  This is now permitted.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>File globbing implemented internally</h2> Perl now uses the File::Glob implementation of the  <i>glob()</i> operator automatically.  This avoids using an external csh process and the problems associated with it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    NOTE: This is currently an experimental feature.  Interfaces and<br/>
    implementation are subject to change.<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Support for CHECK blocks</h2> In addition to &quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot;, &quot;END&quot;, &quot;DESTROY&quot; and &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;, subroutines named &quot;CHECK&quot; are now special.  These are queued up during compilation and behave similar to END blocks, except they are called at the end of compilation rather than at the end of execution.  They cannot be called directly.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>POSIX character class syntax [: :] supported</h2> For example to match alphabetic characters use /[[:alpha:]]/. See perlre for details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Better pseudo-random number generator</h2> In 5.005_0x and earlier, perl's  <i>rand()</i> function used the C library  <i>rand</i>(3) function.  As of 5.005_52, Configure tests for <i>drand48()</i>,  <i>random()</i>, and <i>rand()</i> (in that order) and picks the first one it finds.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These changes should result in better random numbers from <i>rand()</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Improved &quot;qw//&quot; operator</h2> The &quot;qw//&quot; operator is now evaluated at compile time into a true list instead of being replaced with a run time call to &quot;split()&quot;.  This removes the confusing misbehaviour of &quot;qw//&quot; in scalar context, which had inherited that behaviour from  <i>split()</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Thus:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $foo = ($bar) = qw(a b c); print &quot;$foo|$bar\n&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
now correctly prints &quot;3|a&quot;, instead of &quot;2|a&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Better worst-case behavior of hashes</h2> Small changes in the hashing algorithm have been implemented in order to improve the distribution of lower order bits in the hashed value.  This is expected to yield better performance on keys that are repeated sequences.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>pack()</i> format 'Z' supported</h2> The new format type 'Z' is useful for packing and unpacking null-terminated strings.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>pack()</i> format modifier '!' supported</h2> The new format type modifier '!' is useful for packing and unpacking native shorts, ints, and longs.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>pack()</i> and <i>unpack()</i> support counted strings</h2> The template character '/' can be used to specify a counted string type to be packed or unpacked.  See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Comments in <i>pack()</i> templates</h2> The '#' character in a template introduces a comment up to end of the line.  This facilitates documentation of  <i>pack()</i> templates.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Weak references</h2> In previous versions of Perl, you couldn't cache objects so as to allow them to be deleted if the last reference from outside the cache is deleted.  The reference in the cache would hold a reference count on the object and the objects would never be destroyed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Another familiar problem is with circular references.  When an object references itself, its reference count would never go down to zero, and it would not get destroyed until the program is about to exit.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Weak references solve this by allowing you to &quot;weaken&quot; any reference, that is, make it not count towards the reference count. When the last non-weak reference to an object is deleted, the object is destroyed and all the weak references to the object are automatically undef-ed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To use this feature, you need the Devel::WeakRef package from CPAN, which contains additional documentation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    NOTE: This is an experimental feature.  Details are subject to change.<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Binary numbers supported</h2> Binary numbers are now supported as literals, in s?printf formats, and &quot;oct()&quot;:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $answer = 0b101010;<br/>
    printf &quot;The answer is: %b\n&quot;, oct(&quot;0b101010&quot;);<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Lvalue subroutines</h2> Subroutines can now return modifiable lvalues. See &quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    NOTE: This is an experimental feature.  Details are subject to change.<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Some arrows may be omitted in calls through references</h2> Perl now allows the arrow to be omitted in many constructs involving subroutine calls through references.  For example, &quot;$foo[10]-&gt;('foo')&quot; may now be written &quot;$foo[10]('foo')&quot;. This is rather similar to how the arrow may be omitted from &quot;$foo[10]-&gt;{'foo'}&quot;.  Note however, that the arrow is still required for &quot;foo(10)-&gt;('bar')&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Boolean assignment operators are legal lvalues</h2> Constructs such as &quot;($a ||= 2) += 1&quot; are now allowed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>exists()</i> is supported on subroutine names</h2> The  <i>exists()</i> builtin now works on subroutine names.  A subroutine is considered to exist if it has been declared (even if implicitly). See &quot;exists&quot; in perlfunc for examples.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>exists()</i> and <i>delete()</i> are supported on array elements</h2> The  <i>exists()</i> and <i>delete()</i> builtins now work on simple arrays as well. The behavior is similar to that on hash elements.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>exists()</i> can be used to check whether an array element has been initialized.  This avoids autovivifying array elements that don't exist. If the array is tied, the  <i>EXISTS()</i> method in the corresponding tied package will be invoked.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>delete()</i> may be used to remove an element from the array and return it.  The array element at that position returns to its uninitialized state, so that testing for the same element with  <i>exists()</i> will return false.  If the element happens to be the one at the end, the size of the array also shrinks up to the highest element that tests true for  <i>exists()</i>, or 0 if none such is found.  If the array is tied, the <i>DELETE()</i> method in the corresponding tied package will be invoked.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;exists&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;delete&quot; in perlfunc for examples.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Pseudo-hashes work better</h2> Dereferencing some types of reference values in a pseudo-hash, such as &quot;$ph-&gt;{foo}[1]&quot;, was accidentally disallowed.  This has been corrected.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When applied to a pseudo-hash element, <i>exists()</i> now reports whether the specified value exists, not merely if the key is valid.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>delete()</i> now works on pseudo-hashes.  When given a pseudo-hash element or slice it deletes the values corresponding to the keys (but not the keys themselves).  See &quot;Pseudo-hashes: Using an array as a hash&quot; in perlref.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Pseudo-hash slices with constant keys are now optimized to array lookups at compile-time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
List assignments to pseudo-hash slices are now supported.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;fields&quot; pragma now provides ways to create pseudo-hashes, via  <i>fields::new()</i> and <i>fields::phash()</i>.  See fields.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    NOTE: The pseudo-hash data type continues to be experimental.<br/>
    Limiting oneself to the interface elements provided by the<br/>
    fields pragma will provide protection from any future changes.<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Automatic flushing of output buffers</h2>  <i>fork()</i>, <i>exec()</i>, <i>system()</i>, qx//, and pipe <i>open()</i>s now flush buffers of all files opened for output when the operation was attempted.  This mostly eliminates confusing buffering mishaps suffered by users unaware of how Perl internally handles I/O.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is not supported on some platforms like Solaris where a suitably correct implementation of fflush(NULL) isn't available.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Better diagnostics on meaningless filehandle operations</h2> Constructs such as &quot;open(&lt;FH&gt;)&quot; and &quot;close(&lt;FH&gt;)&quot; are compile time errors.  Attempting to read from filehandles that were opened only for writing will now produce warnings (just as writing to read-only filehandles does).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Where possible, buffered data discarded from duped input filehandle</h2> &quot;open(NEW, &quot;&lt;&amp;OLD&quot;)&quot; now attempts to discard any data that was previously read and buffered in &quot;OLD&quot; before duping the handle. On platforms where doing this is allowed, the next read operation on &quot;NEW&quot; will return the same data as the corresponding operation on &quot;OLD&quot;.  Formerly, it would have returned the data from the start of the following disk block instead.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>eof()</i> has the same old magic as &lt;&gt;</h2> &quot;eof()&quot; would return true if no attempt to read from &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; had yet been made.  &quot;eof()&quot; has been changed to have a little magic of its own, it now opens the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; files.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>binmode()</i> can be used to set :crlf and :raw modes</h2>  <i>binmode()</i> now accepts a second argument that specifies a discipline for the handle in question.  The two pseudo-disciplines &quot;:raw&quot; and &quot;:crlf&quot; are currently supported on DOS-derivative platforms. See &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc and open.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;-T&quot; filetest recognizes UTF-8 encoded files as &quot;text&quot;</h2> The algorithm used for the &quot;-T&quot; filetest has been enhanced to correctly identify UTF-8 content as &quot;text&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>system()</i>, backticks and pipe open now reflect <i>exec()</i> failure</h2> On Unix and similar platforms,  <i>system()</i>, <i>qx()</i> and open(FOO, &quot;cmd |&quot;) etc., are implemented via  <i>fork()</i> and <i>exec()</i>.  When the underlying  <i>exec()</i> fails, earlier versions did not report the error properly, since the  <i>exec()</i> happened to be in a different process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The child process now communicates with the parent about the error in launching the external command, which allows these constructs to return with their usual error value and set $!.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Improved diagnostics</h2> Line numbers are no longer suppressed (under most likely circumstances) during the global destruction phase.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Diagnostics emitted from code running in threads other than the main thread are now accompanied by the thread ID.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Embedded null characters in diagnostics now actually show up.  They used to truncate the message in prior versions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
$foo::a and $foo::b are now exempt from &quot;possible typo&quot; warnings only if  <i>sort()</i> is encountered in package &quot;foo&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unrecognized alphabetic escapes encountered when parsing quote constructs now generate a warning, since they may take on new semantics in later versions of Perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Many diagnostics now report the internal operation in which the warning was provoked, like so:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) at (eval 1) line 1.<br/>
    Use of uninitialized value in print at (eval 1) line 1.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Diagnostics  that occur within eval may also report the file and line number where the eval is located, in addition to the eval sequence number and the line number within the evaluated text itself.  For example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    Not enough arguments for scalar at (eval 4)[newlib/perl5db.pl:1411] line 2, at EOF<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Diagnostics follow STDERR</h2> Diagnostic output now goes to whichever file the &quot;STDERR&quot; handle is pointing at, instead of always going to the underlying C runtime library's &quot;stderr&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>More consistent close-on-exec behavior</h2> On systems that support a close-on-exec flag on filehandles, the flag is now set for any handles created by  <i>pipe()</i>, <i>socketpair()</i>,  <i>socket()</i>, and <i>accept()</i>, if that is warranted by the value of $^F that may be in effect.  Earlier versions neglected to set the flag for handles created with these operators.  See &quot;pipe&quot; in perlfunc, &quot;socketpair&quot; in perlfunc, &quot;socket&quot; in perlfunc, &quot;accept&quot; in perlfunc, and &quot;$^F&quot; in perlvar.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>syswrite()</i> ease-of-use</h2> The length argument of &quot;syswrite()&quot; has become optional.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Better syntax checks on parenthesized unary operators</h2> Expressions such as:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    print defined(&amp;foo,&amp;bar,&amp;baz);<br/>
    print uc(&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;baz&quot;);<br/>
    undef($foo,&amp;bar);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
used to be accidentally allowed in earlier versions, and produced unpredictable behaviour.  Some produced ancillary warnings when used in this way; others silently did the wrong thing.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The parenthesized forms of most unary operators that expect a single argument now ensure that they are not called with more than one argument, making the cases shown above syntax errors.  The usual behaviour of:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    print defined &amp;foo, &amp;bar, &amp;baz;<br/>
    print uc &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;;<br/>
    undef $foo, &amp;bar;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
remains unchanged.  See perlop.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Bit operators support full native integer width</h2> The bit operators (&amp; | ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;) now operate on the full native integral width (the exact size of which is available in $Config{ivsize}). For example, if your platform is either natively 64-bit or if Perl has been configured to use 64-bit integers, these operations apply to 8 bytes (as opposed to 4 bytes on 32-bit platforms). For portability, be sure to mask off the excess bits in the result of unary &quot;~&quot;, e.g., &quot;~$x &amp; 0xffffffff&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Improved security features</h2> More potentially unsafe operations taint their results for improved security.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;passwd&quot; and &quot;shell&quot; fields returned by the <i>getpwent()</i>, <i>getpwnam()</i>, and  <i>getpwuid()</i> are now tainted, because the user can affect their own encrypted password and login shell.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The variable modified by <i>shmread()</i>, and messages returned by <i>msgrcv()</i> (and its object-oriented interface IPC::SysV::Msg::rcv) are also tainted, because other untrusted processes can modify messages and shared memory segments for their own nefarious purposes.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>More functional bareword prototype (*)</h2> Bareword prototypes have been rationalized to enable them to be used to override builtins that accept barewords and interpret them in a special way, such as &quot;require&quot; or &quot;do&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Arguments prototyped as &quot;*&quot; will now be visible within the subroutine as either a simple scalar or as a reference to a typeglob. See &quot;Prototypes&quot; in perlsub.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;require&quot; and &quot;do&quot; may be overridden</h2> &quot;require&quot; and &quot;do 'file'&quot; operations may be overridden locally by importing subroutines of the same name into the current package (or globally by importing them into the CORE::GLOBAL:: namespace). Overriding &quot;require&quot; will also affect &quot;use&quot;, provided the override is visible at compile-time. See &quot;Overriding Built-in Functions&quot; in perlsub.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>$^X variables may now have names longer than one character</h2> Formerly, $^X was synonymous with ${&quot;\cX&quot;}, but $^XY was a syntax error.  Now variable names that begin with a control character may be arbitrarily long.  However, for compatibility reasons, these variables  <i>must</i> be written with explicit braces, as &quot;${^XY}&quot; for example. &quot;${^XYZ}&quot; is synonymous with ${&quot;\cXYZ&quot;}.  Variable names with more than one control character, such as &quot;${^XY^Z}&quot;, are illegal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The old syntax has not changed.  As before, `^X' may be either a literal control-X character or the two-character sequence `caret' plus `X'.  When braces are omitted, the variable name stops after the control character.  Thus &quot;$^XYZ&quot; continues to be synonymous with &quot;$^X . &quot;YZ&quot;&quot; as before.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As before, lexical variables may not have names beginning with control characters.  As before, variables whose names begin with a control character are always forced to be in package `main'.  All such variables are reserved for future extensions, except those that begin with &quot;^_&quot;, which may be used by user programs and are guaranteed not to acquire special meaning in any future version of Perl.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New variable $^C reflects &quot;-c&quot; switch</h2> $^C has a boolean value that reflects whether perl is being run in compile-only mode (i.e. via the &quot;-c&quot; switch).  Since BEGIN blocks are executed under such conditions, this variable enables perl code to determine whether actions that make sense only during normal running are warranted.  See perlvar.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New variable $^V contains Perl version as a string</h2> $^V contains the Perl version number as a string composed of characters whose ordinals match the version numbers, i.e. v5.6.0. This may be used in string comparisons.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;Support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals&quot; for an example.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Optional Y2K warnings</h2> If Perl is built with the cpp macro &quot;PERL_Y2KWARN&quot; defined, it emits optional warnings when concatenating the number 19 with another number.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This behavior must be specifically enabled when running Configure. See  <i>INSTALL</i> and <i>README.Y2K</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings</h2> In double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter what.  The behavior in earlier versions of perl 5 was that arrays would interpolate into strings if the array had been mentioned before the string was compiled, and otherwise Perl would raise a fatal compile-time error. In versions 5.000 through 5.003, the error was<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        Literal @example now requires backslash<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In versions 5.004_01 through 5.6.0, the error was<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        In string, @example now must be written as \@example<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The idea here was to get people into the habit of writing &quot;fred\@example.com&quot; when they wanted a literal &quot;@&quot; sign, just as they have always written &quot;Give me back my \$5&quot; when they wanted a literal &quot;$&quot; sign.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Starting with 5.6.1, when Perl now sees an &quot;@&quot; sign in a double-quoted string, it  <i>always</i> attempts to interpolate an array, regardless of whether or not the array has been used or declared already.  The fatal error has been downgraded to an optional warning:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        Possible unintended interpolation of @example in string<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This warns you that &quot;fred@example.com&quot; is going to turn into &quot;fred.com&quot; if you don't backslash the &quot;@&quot;. See http://perl.plover.com/at-error.html for more details about the history here.</div>

Benchmark</dt>
<dd>
Overall, Benchmark results exhibit lower average error and better timing accuracy.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can now run tests for <i>n</i> seconds instead of guessing the right number of tests to run: e.g., timethese(-5, ...) will run each code for at least 5 CPU seconds.  Zero as the &quot;number of repetitions&quot; means &quot;for at least 3 CPU seconds&quot;.  The output format has also changed.  For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   use Benchmark;$x=3;timethese(-5,{a=&gt;sub{$x*$x},b=&gt;sub{$x**2}})<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
will now output something like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   Benchmark: running a, b, each for at least 5 CPU seconds...<br/>
            a:  5 wallclock secs ( 5.77 usr +  0.00 sys =  5.77 CPU) @ 200551.91/s (n=1156516)<br/>
            b:  4 wallclock secs ( 5.00 usr +  0.02 sys =  5.02 CPU) @ 159605.18/s (n=800686)<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
New features: &quot;each for at least N CPU seconds...&quot;, &quot;wallclock secs&quot;, and the &quot;@ operations/CPU second (n=operations)&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>timethese()</i> now returns a reference to a hash of Benchmark objects containing the test results, keyed on the names of the tests.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>timethis()</i> now returns the iterations field in the Benchmark result object instead of 0.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>timethese()</i>, <i>timethis()</i>, and the new <i>cmpthese()</i> (see below) can also take a format specifier of 'none' to suppress output.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A new function <i>countit()</i> is just like <i>timeit()</i> except that it takes a TIME instead of a COUNT.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A new function <i>cmpthese()</i> prints a chart comparing the results of each test returned from a  <i>timethese()</i> call.  For each possible pair of tests, the percentage speed difference (iters/sec or seconds/iter) is shown.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The new version also allows a leading underscore in constant names, but disallows a double leading underscore (as in &quot;__LINE__&quot;).  Some other names are disallowed or warned against, including BEGIN, END, etc.  Some names which were forced into main:: used to fail silently in some cases; now they're fatal (outside of main::) and an optional warning (inside of main::). The ability to detect whether a constant had been set with a given name has been added.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

A bug that prevented the <i>IO::Socket::protocol()</i> accessor from ever returning the correct value has been corrected.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

&#160;</div>
The class method &quot;display_format&quot; and the corresponding object method &quot;display_format&quot;, in addition to accepting just one argument, now can also accept a parameter hash.  Recognized keys of a parameter hash are &quot;style&quot;, which corresponds to the old one parameter case, and two new parameters: &quot;format&quot;, which is a  <i>printf()</i>-style format string (defaults usually to &quot;%.15g&quot;, you can revert to the default by setting the format string to &quot;undef&quot;) used for both parts of a complex number, and &quot;polar_pretty_print&quot; (defaults to true), which controls whether an attempt is made to try to recognize small multiples and rationals of pi (2pi, pi/2) at the argument (angle) of a polar complex number.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The  <i>pod2usage()</i> function is generally useful to all script authors since it lets them write and maintain a single source (the pods) for documentation, thus removing the need to create and maintain redundant usage message text consisting of information already in the pods.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There is also a pod2usage script which can be used from other kinds of scripts to print usage messages from pods (even for non-Perl scripts with pods embedded in comments).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For details and examples, please see Pod::Usage.</dd>

<dt>
Pod::Text and Pod::Man</dt>
<dd>
Pod::Text has been rewritten to use Pod::Parser.  While <i>pod2text()</i> is still available for backwards compatibility, the module now has a new preferred interface.  See Pod::Text for the details.  The new Pod::Text module is easily subclassed for tweaks to the output, and two such subclasses (Pod::Text::Termcap for man-page-style bold and underlining using termcap information, and Pod::Text::Color for markup with ANSI color sequences) are now standard.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
pod2man has been turned into a module, Pod::Man, which also uses Pod::Parser.  In the process, several outstanding bugs related to quotes in section headers, quoting of code escapes, and nested lists have been fixed.  pod2man is now a wrapper script around this module.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
SDBM_File</dt>
<dd>
An EXISTS method has been added to this module (and <i>sdbm_exists()</i> has been added to the underlying sdbm library), so one can now call exists on an SDBM_File tied hash and get the correct result, rather than a runtime error.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A bug that may have caused data loss when more than one disk block happens to be read from the database in a single  <i>FETCH()</i> has been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Sys::Syslog</dt>
<dd>
Sys::Syslog now uses XSUBs to access facilities from syslog.h so it no longer requires syslog.ph to exist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Sys::Hostname</dt>
<dd>
Sys::Hostname now uses XSUBs to call the C library's <i>gethostname()</i> or  <i>uname()</i> if they exist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Term::ANSIColor</dt>
<dd>
Term::ANSIColor is a very simple module to provide easy and readable access to the ANSI color and highlighting escape sequences, supported by most ANSI terminal emulators.  It is now included standard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Time::Local</dt>
<dd>
The <i>timelocal()</i> and <i>timegm()</i> functions used to silently return bogus results when the date fell outside the machine's integer range.  They now consistently  <i>croak()</i> if the date falls in an unsupported range.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Win32</dt>
<dd>
The error return value in list context has been changed for all functions that return a list of values.  Previously these functions returned a list with a single element &quot;undef&quot; if an error occurred.  Now these functions return the empty list in these situations.  This applies to the following functions:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    Win32::FsType<br/>
    Win32::GetOSVersion<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The remaining functions are unchanged and continue to return &quot;undef&quot; on error even in list context.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The Win32::SetLastError(ERROR) function has been added as a complement to the  <i>Win32::GetLastError()</i> function.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The new Win32::GetFullPathName(FILENAME) returns the full absolute pathname for FILENAME in scalar context.  In list context it returns a two-element list containing the fully qualified directory name and the filename.  See Win32.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
XSLoader</dt>
<dd>
The XSLoader extension is a simpler alternative to DynaLoader. See XSLoader.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
DBM Filters</dt>
<dd>
A new feature called &quot;DBM Filters&quot; has been added to all the DBM modules--DB_File, GDBM_File, NDBM_File, ODBM_File, and SDBM_File. DBM Filters add four new methods to each DBM module:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    filter_store_key<br/>
    filter_store_value<br/>
    filter_fetch_key<br/>
    filter_fetch_value<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
These can be used to filter key-value pairs before the pairs are written to the database or just after they are read from the database. See perldbmfilter for further information.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Pragmata</h2> &quot;use attrs&quot; is now obsolete, and is only provided for backward-compatibility.  It's been replaced by the &quot;sub : attributes&quot; syntax.  See &quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot; in perlsub and attributes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Lexical warnings pragma, &quot;use warnings;&quot;, to control optional warnings. See perllexwarn.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;use filetest&quot; to control the behaviour of filetests (&quot;-r&quot; &quot;-w&quot; ...).  Currently only one subpragma implemented, &quot;use filetest 'access';&quot;, that uses  <i>access</i>(2) or equivalent to check permissions instead of using  <i>stat</i>(2) as usual.  This matters in filesystems where there are ACLs (access control lists): the  <i>stat</i>(2) might lie, but  <i>access</i>(2) knows better.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;open&quot; pragma can be used to specify default disciplines for handle constructors (e.g.  <i>open()</i>) and for qx//.  The two pseudo-disciplines &quot;:raw&quot; and &quot;:crlf&quot; are currently supported on DOS-derivative platforms (i.e. where binmode is not a no-op). See also &quot; <i>binmode()</i> can be used to set :crlf and :raw modes&quot;.</div>

<h1>Utility Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>dprofpp</h2> &quot;dprofpp&quot; is used to display profile data generated using &quot;Devel::DProf&quot;. See dprofpp.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>find2perl</h2> The &quot;find2perl&quot; utility now uses the enhanced features of the File::Find module.  The -depth and -follow options are supported.  Pod documentation is also included in the script.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>h2xs</h2> The &quot;h2xs&quot; tool can now work in conjunction with &quot;C::Scan&quot; (available from CPAN) to automatically parse real-life header files.  The &quot;-M&quot;, &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-k&quot;, and &quot;-o&quot; options are new.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>perlcc</h2> &quot;perlcc&quot; now supports the C and Bytecode backends.  By default, it generates output from the simple C backend rather than the optimized C backend.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Support for non-Unix platforms has been improved.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>perldoc</h2> &quot;perldoc&quot; has been reworked to avoid possible security holes. It will not by default let itself be run as the superuser, but you may still use the  <b>-U</b> switch to try to make it drop privileges first.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The Perl Debugger</h2> Many bug fixes and enhancements were added to  <i>perl5db.pl</i>, the Perl debugger.  The help documentation was rearranged.  New commands include &quot;&lt; ?&quot;, &quot;&gt; ?&quot;, and &quot;{ ?&quot; to list out current actions, &quot;man  <i>docpage</i>&quot; to run your doc viewer on some perl docset, and support for quoted options.  The help information was rearranged, and should be viewable once again if you're using  <b>less</b> as your pager.  A serious security hole was plugged--you should immediately remove all older versions of the Perl debugger as installed in previous releases, all the way back to perl3, from your system to avoid being bitten by this.</div>

<h1>Performance enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Simple <i>sort()</i> using { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } and the like are optimized</h2> Many common  <i>sort()</i> operations using a simple inlined block are now optimized for faster performance.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Optimized assignments to lexical variables</h2> Certain operations in the RHS of assignment statements have been optimized to directly set the lexical variable on the LHS, eliminating redundant copying overheads.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Faster subroutine calls</h2> Minor changes in how subroutine calls are handled internally provide marginal improvements in performance.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>delete()</i>, <i>each()</i>, <i>values()</i> and hash iteration are faster</h2> The hash values returned by  <i>delete()</i>, <i>each()</i>, <i>values()</i> and hashes in a list context are the actual values in the hash, instead of copies. This results in significantly better performance, because it eliminates needless copying in most situations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Installation and Configuration Improvements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>-Dusethreads means something different</h2> The -Dusethreads flag now enables the experimental interpreter-based thread support by default.  To get the flavor of experimental threads that was in 5.005 instead, you need to run Configure with &quot;-Dusethreads -Duse5005threads&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As of v5.6.0, interpreter-threads support is still lacking a way to create new threads from Perl (i.e., &quot;use Thread;&quot; will not work with interpreter threads).  &quot;use Thread;&quot; continues to be available when you specify the -Duse5005threads option to Configure, bugs and all.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    NOTE: Support for threads continues to be an experimental feature.<br/>
    Interfaces and implementation are subject to sudden and drastic changes.<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New Configure flags</h2> The following new flags may be enabled on the Configure command line by running Configure with &quot;-Dflag&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    usemultiplicity<br/>
    usethreads useithreads      (new interpreter threads: no Perl API yet)<br/>
    usethreads use5005threads   (threads as they were in 5.005)<br/>
<br/>
    use64bitint                 (equal to now deprecated 'use64bits')<br/>
    use64bitall<br/>
<br/>
    uselongdouble<br/>
    usemorebits<br/>
    uselargefiles<br/>
    usesocks                    (only SOCKS v5 supported)<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Threadedness and 64-bitness now more daring</h2> The Configure options enabling the use of threads and the use of 64-bitness are now more daring in the sense that they no more have an explicit list of operating systems of known threads/64-bit capabilities.  In other words: if your operating system has the necessary APIs and datatypes, you should be able just to go ahead and use them, for threads by Configure -Dusethreads, and for 64 bits either explicitly by Configure -Duse64bitint or implicitly if your system has 64-bit wide datatypes.  See also &quot;64-bit support&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Long Doubles</h2> Some platforms have &quot;long doubles&quot;, floating point numbers of even larger range than ordinary &quot;doubles&quot;.  To enable using long doubles for Perl's scalars, use -Duselongdouble.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>-Dusemorebits</h2> You can enable both -Duse64bitint and -Duselongdouble with -Dusemorebits. See also &quot;64-bit support&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>-Duselargefiles</h2> Some platforms support system APIs that are capable of handling large files (typically, files larger than two gigabytes).  Perl will try to use these APIs if you ask for -Duselargefiles.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;Large file support&quot; for more information.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>installusrbinperl</h2> You can use &quot;Configure -Uinstallusrbinperl&quot; which causes installperl to skip installing perl also as /usr/bin/perl.  This is useful if you prefer not to modify /usr/bin for some reason or another but harmful because many scripts assume to find Perl in /usr/bin/perl.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>SOCKS support</h2> You can use &quot;Configure -Dusesocks&quot; which causes Perl to probe for the SOCKS proxy protocol library (v5, not v4).  For more information on SOCKS, see:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    http://www.socks.nec.com/<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;-A&quot; flag</h2> You can &quot;post-edit&quot; the Configure variables using the Configure &quot;-A&quot; switch.  The editing happens immediately after the platform specific hints files have been processed but before the actual configuration process starts.  Run &quot;Configure -h&quot; to find out the full &quot;-A&quot; syntax.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Enhanced Installation Directories</h2> The installation structure has been enriched to improve the support for maintaining multiple versions of perl, to provide locations for vendor-supplied modules, scripts, and manpages, and to ease maintenance of locally-added modules, scripts, and manpages.  See the section on Installation Directories in the INSTALL file for complete details. For most users building and installing from source, the defaults should be fine.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you previously used &quot;Configure -Dsitelib&quot; or &quot;-Dsitearch&quot; to set special values for library directories, you might wish to consider using the new &quot;-Dsiteprefix&quot; setting instead.  Also, if you wish to re-use a config.sh file from an earlier version of perl, you should be sure to check that Configure makes sensible choices for the new directories. See INSTALL for complete details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>gcc automatically tried if 'cc' does not seem to be working</h2> In many platforms the vendor-supplied 'cc' is too stripped-down to build Perl (basically, the 'cc' doesn't do ANSI C).  If this seems to be the case and the 'cc' does not seem to be the GNU C compiler 'gcc', an automatic attempt is made to find and use 'gcc' instead.</div>

<h2>OS390 (OpenEdition MVS)</h2> Support for this EBCDIC platform has not been renewed in this release. There are difficulties in reconciling Perl's standardization on UTF-8 as its internal representation for characters with the EBCDIC character set, because the two are incompatible.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is unclear whether future versions will renew support for this platform, but the possibility exists.</div>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Win32</h2> Perl can now emulate  <i>fork()</i> internally, using multiple interpreters running in different concurrent threads.  This support must be enabled at build time.  See perlfork for detailed information.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When given a pathname that consists only of a drivename, such as &quot;A:&quot;,  <i>opendir()</i> and <i>stat()</i> now use the current working directory for the drive rather than the drive root.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The builtin XSUB functions in the Win32:: namespace are documented.  See Win32.<div class="spacer">
</div>
$^X now contains the full path name of the running executable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A <i>Win32::GetLongPathName()</i> function is provided to complement  <i>Win32::GetFullPathName()</i> and <i>Win32::GetShortPathName()</i>.  See Win32.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>POSIX::uname()</i> is supported.<div class="spacer">
</div>
system(1,...) now returns true process IDs rather than process handles.   <i>kill()</i> accepts any real process id, rather than strictly return values from system(1,...).<div class="spacer">
</div>
For better compatibility with Unix, &quot;kill(0, $pid)&quot; can now be used to test whether a process exists.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;Shell&quot; module is supported.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Better support for building Perl under command.com in Windows 95 has been added.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Scripts are read in binary mode by default to allow ByteLoader (and the filter mechanism in general) to work properly.  For compatibility, the DATA filehandle will be set to text mode if a carriage return is detected at the end of the line containing the __END__ or __DATA__ token; if not, the DATA filehandle will be left open in binary mode. Earlier versions always opened the DATA filehandle in text mode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>glob()</i> operator is implemented via the &quot;File::Glob&quot; extension, which supports glob syntax of the C shell.  This increases the flexibility of the  <i>glob()</i> operator, but there may be compatibility issues for programs that relied on the older globbing syntax.  If you want to preserve compatibility with the older syntax, you might want to run perl with &quot;-MFile::DosGlob&quot;.  For details and compatibility information, see File::Glob.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Significant bug fixes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>&lt;HANDLE&gt; on empty files</h2> With $/ set to &quot;undef&quot;, &quot;slurping&quot; an empty file returns a string of zero length (instead of &quot;undef&quot;, as it used to) the first time the HANDLE is read after $/ is set to &quot;undef&quot;.  Further reads yield &quot;undef&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This means that the following will append &quot;foo&quot; to an empty file (it used to do nothing):<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    perl -0777 -pi -e 's/^/foo/' empty_file<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The behaviour of:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    perl -pi -e 's/^/foo/' empty_file<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
is unchanged (it continues to leave the file empty).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;eval '...'&quot; improvements</h2> Line numbers (as reflected by  <i>caller()</i> and most diagnostics) within &quot;eval '...'&quot; were often incorrect where here documents were involved. This has been corrected.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Lexical lookups for variables appearing in &quot;eval '...'&quot; within functions that were themselves called within an &quot;eval '...'&quot; were searching the wrong place for lexicals.  The lexical search now correctly ends at the subroutine's block boundary.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The use of &quot;return&quot; within &quot;eval {...}&quot; caused $@ not to be reset correctly when no exception occurred within the eval.  This has been fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Parsing of here documents used to be flawed when they appeared as the replacement expression in &quot;eval 's/.../.../e'&quot;.  This has been fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>All compilation errors are true errors</h2> Some &quot;errors&quot; encountered at compile time were by necessity generated as warnings followed by eventual termination of the program.  This enabled more such errors to be reported in a single run, rather than causing a hard stop at the first error that was encountered.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The mechanism for reporting such errors has been reimplemented to queue compile-time errors and report them at the end of the compilation as true errors rather than as warnings.  This fixes cases where error messages leaked through in the form of warnings when code was compiled at run time using &quot;eval STRING&quot;, and also allows such errors to be reliably trapped using &quot;eval &quot;...&quot;&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Implicitly closed filehandles are safer</h2> Sometimes implicitly closed filehandles (as when they are localized, and Perl automatically closes them on exiting the scope) could inadvertently set $? or $!.  This has been corrected.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Behavior of list slices is more consistent</h2> When taking a slice of a literal list (as opposed to a slice of an array or hash), Perl used to return an empty list if the result happened to be composed of all undef values.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The new behavior is to produce an empty list if (and only if) the original list was empty.  Consider the following example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    @a = (1,undef,undef,2)[2,1,2];<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The old behavior would have resulted in @a having no elements. The new behavior ensures it has three undefined elements.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note in particular that the behavior of slices of the following cases remains unchanged:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    @a = ()[1,2];<br/>
    @a = (getpwent)[7,0];<br/>
    @a = (anything_returning_empty_list())[2,1,2];<br/>
    @a = @b[2,1,2];<br/>
    @a = @c{'a','b','c'};<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
See perldata.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;(\$)&quot; prototype and $foo{a}</h2> A scalar reference prototype now correctly allows a hash or array element in that slot.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;goto &amp;sub&quot; and AUTOLOAD</h2> The &quot;goto &amp;sub&quot; construct works correctly when &amp;sub happens to be autoloaded.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;-bareword&quot; allowed under &quot;use integer&quot;</h2> The autoquoting of barewords preceded by &quot;-&quot; did not work in prior versions when the &quot;integer&quot; pragma was enabled. This has been fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Failures in <i>DESTROY()</i></h2> When code in a destructor threw an exception, it went unnoticed in earlier versions of Perl, unless someone happened to be looking in $@ just after the point the destructor happened to run.  Such failures are now visible as warnings when warnings are enabled.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Locale bugs fixed</h2>  <i>printf()</i> and <i>sprintf()</i> previously reset the numeric locale back to the default &quot;C&quot; locale.  This has been fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Numbers formatted according to the local numeric locale (such as using a decimal comma instead of a decimal dot) caused &quot;isn't numeric&quot; warnings, even while the operations accessing those numbers produced correct results.  These warnings have been discontinued.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Memory leaks</h2> The &quot;eval 'return sub {...}'&quot; construct could sometimes leak memory.  This has been fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Operations that aren't filehandle constructors used to leak memory when used on invalid filehandles.  This has been fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Constructs that modified @_ could fail to deallocate values in @_ and thus leak memory.  This has been corrected.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Spurious subroutine stubs after failed subroutine calls</h2> Perl could sometimes create empty subroutine stubs when a subroutine was not found in the package.  Such cases stopped later method lookups from progressing into base packages. This has been corrected.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Taint failures under &quot;-U&quot;</h2> When running in unsafe mode, taint violations could sometimes cause silent failures.  This has been fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>END blocks and the &quot;-c&quot; switch</h2> Prior versions used to run BEGIN  <b>and</b> END blocks when Perl was run in compile-only mode.  Since this is typically not the expected behavior, END blocks are not executed anymore when the &quot;-c&quot; switch is used, or if compilation fails.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;Support for CHECK blocks&quot; for how to run things when the compile phase ends.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Potential to leak DATA filehandles</h2> Using the &quot;__DATA__&quot; token creates an implicit filehandle to the file that contains the token.  It is the program's responsibility to close it when it is done reading from it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This caveat is now better explained in the documentation. See perldata.</div>

<h1>New or Changed Diagnostics</h1><dl>
<dt>
&quot;%s&quot; variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) A &quot;my&quot; or &quot;our&quot; variable has been redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.  Note that the earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope or until all closure referents to it are destroyed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;my sub&quot; not yet implemented</dt>
<dd>
(F) Lexically scoped subroutines are not yet implemented.  Don't try that yet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;our&quot; variable %s redeclared</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) You seem to have already declared the same global once before in the current lexical scope.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
'!' allowed only after types %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) The '!' is allowed in <i>pack()</i> and <i>unpack()</i> only after certain types. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
/ cannot take a count</dt>
<dd>
(F) You had an unpack template indicating a counted-length string, but you have also specified an explicit size for the string. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
/ must be followed by a, A or Z</dt>
<dd>
(F) You had an unpack template indicating a counted-length string, which must be followed by one of the letters a, A or Z to indicate what sort of string is to be unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
/ must be followed by a*, A* or Z*</dt>
<dd>
(F) You had a pack template indicating a counted-length string, Currently the only things that can have their length counted are a*, A* or Z*. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
/ must follow a numeric type</dt>
<dd>
(F) You had an unpack template that contained a '#', but this did not follow some numeric unpack specification. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
/%s/: Unrecognized escape \\%c passed through</dt>
<dd>
(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which is not recognized by Perl.  This combination appears in an interpolated variable or a &quot;'&quot;-delimited regular expression.  The character was understood literally.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
/%s/: Unrecognized escape \\%c in character class passed through</dt>
<dd>
(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which is not recognized by Perl inside character classes.  The character was understood literally.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
/%s/ should probably be written as &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find a string, as in the first argument to &quot;join&quot;.  Perl will treat the true or false result of matching the pattern against $_ as the string, which is probably not what you had in mind.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s() called too early to check prototype</dt>
<dd>
(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check that the call conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype checking.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid the warning.  See perlsub.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element</dt>
<dd>
(F) The argument to <i>exists()</i> must be a hash or array element, such as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $foo{$bar}<br/>
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice</dt>
<dd>
(F) The argument to <i>delete()</i> must be either a hash or array element, such as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $foo{$bar}<br/>
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
or a hash or array slice, such as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]<br/>
    @{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s argument is not a subroutine name</dt>
<dd>
(F) The argument to <i>exists()</i> for &quot;exists &amp;sub&quot; must be a subroutine name, and not a subroutine call.  &quot;exists &amp;sub()&quot; will generate this error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s package attribute may clash with future reserved word: %s</dt>
<dd>
(W reserved) A lowercase attribute name was used that had a package-specific handler. That name might have a meaning to Perl itself some day, even though it doesn't yet.  Perhaps you should use a mixed-case attribute name, instead. See attributes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
(in cleanup) %s</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a <i>DESTROY()</i> method raised the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by the system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; flag could also result in this warning.  See &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; in perlcall.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&lt;&gt; should be quotes</dt>
<dd>
(F) You wrote &quot;require &lt;file&gt;&quot; when you should have written &quot;require 'file'&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Attempt to join self</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an impossible task.  You may be joining the wrong thread, or you may need to move the  <i>join()</i> to some other thread.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad evalled substitution pattern</dt>
<dd>
(F) You've used the /e switch to evaluate the replacement for a substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate, most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad <i>realloc()</i> ignored</dt>
<dd>
(S) An internal routine called <i>realloc()</i> on something that had never been  <i>malloc()</i>ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by setting environment variable &quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot; to 1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bareword found in conditional</dt>
<dd>
(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    open FOO || die;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as a bareword:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use constant TYPO =&gt; 1;<br/>
    if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The &quot;strict&quot; pragma is useful in avoiding such errors.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
Binary number &gt; 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</dt>
<dd>
(W portable) The binary number you specified is larger than 2**32-1 (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See perlport for more on portability concerns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bit vector size &gt; 32 non-portable</dt>
<dd>
(W portable) Using bit vector sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</dt>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  While Perl was preparing to iterate over %ENV, it encountered a logical name or symbol definition which was too long, so it was truncated to the string shown.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't check filesystem of script &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(P) For some reason you can't check the filesystem of the script for nosuid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't declare class for non-scalar %s in &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(S) Currently, only scalar variables can declared with a specific class qualifier in a &quot;my&quot; or &quot;our&quot; declaration.  The semantics may be extended for other types of variables in future.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't declare %s in &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared as &quot;my&quot; or &quot;our&quot; variables.  They must have ordinary identifiers as names.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</dt>
<dd>
(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value. This situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl may be running (e.g., cron) is being very careless.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call</dt>
<dd>
(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as such, see &quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't read CRTL environ</dt>
<dd>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read an element of %ENV from the CRTL's internal environment array and discovered the array was missing.  You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ or define  <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see perlvms) so that environ is not searched.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file</dt>
<dd>
(S) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup file.  Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it with the modified file.  The file was left unmodified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue. This is not allowed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't weaken a nonreference</dt>
<dd>
(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference.  Only references can be weakened.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Character class [:%s:] unknown</dt>
<dd>
(F) The class in the character class [: :] syntax is unknown. See perlre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Character class syntax [%s] belongs inside character classes</dt>
<dd>
(W unsafe) The character class constructs [: :], [= =], and [. .]  go  <i>inside</i> character classes, the [] are part of the construct, for example: /[012[:alpha:]345]/.  Note that [= =] and [. .] are not currently implemented; they are simply placeholders for future extensions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Constant is not %s reference</dt>
<dd>
(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the &quot;use constant&quot; pragma) is being dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of reference.  The message indicates the type of reference that was expected. This usually indicates a syntax error in dereferencing the constant value. See &quot;Constant Functions&quot; in perlsub and constant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
constant(%s): %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) The parser found inconsistencies either while attempting to define an overloaded constant, or when trying to find the character name specified in the &quot;\N{...}&quot; escape.  Perhaps you forgot to load the corresponding &quot;overload&quot; or &quot;charnames&quot; pragma?  See charnames and overload.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
CORE::%s is not a keyword</dt>
<dd>
(F) The CORE:: namespace is reserved for Perl keywords.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
defined(@array) is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D) <i>defined()</i> is not usually useful on arrays because it checks for an undefined  <i>scalar</i> value.  If you want to see if the array is empty, just use &quot;if (@array) { # not empty }&quot; for example.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
defined(%hash) is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D) <i>defined()</i> is not usually useful on hashes because it checks for an undefined  <i>scalar</i> value.  If you want to see if the hash is empty, just use &quot;if (%hash) { # not empty }&quot; for example.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
See Server error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
(Did you mean &quot;local&quot; instead of &quot;our&quot;?)</dt>
<dd>
(W misc) Remember that &quot;our&quot; does not localize the declared global variable. You have declared it again in the same lexical scope, which seems superfluous.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
false [] range &quot;%s&quot; in regexp</dt>
<dd>
(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a literal character, not another character class like &quot;\d&quot; or &quot;[:alpha:]&quot;.  The &quot;-&quot; in your false range is interpreted as a literal &quot;-&quot;.  Consider quoting the &quot;-&quot;,  &quot;\-&quot;. See perlre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Filehandle %s opened only for output</dt>
<dd>
(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing.  If you intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&lt;&quot; or nothing.  If you intended only to read from the file, use &quot;&lt;&quot;.  See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>flock()</i> on closed filehandle %s</dt>
<dd>
(W closed) The filehandle you're attempting to <i>flock()</i> got itself closed some time before now.  Check your logic flow.   <i>flock()</i> operates on filehandles. Are you attempting to call  <i>flock()</i> on a dirhandle by the same name?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Global symbol &quot;%s&quot; requires explicit package name</dt>
<dd>
(F) You've said &quot;use strict vars&quot;, which indicates that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using &quot;my&quot;), declared beforehand using &quot;our&quot;, or explicitly qualified to say which package the global variable is in (using &quot;::&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</dt>
<dd>
(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1 (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See perlport for more on portability concerns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ill-formed CRTL environ value &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the CRTL's internal environ array, and encountered an element without the &quot;=&quot; delimiter used to separate keys from values.  The element is ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</dt>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read a logical name or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over %ENV, and didn't see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal binary digit %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal binary digit %s ignored</dt>
<dd>
(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number. Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the offending digit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal number of bits in vec</dt>
<dd>
(F) The number of bits in <i>vec()</i> (the third argument) must be a power of two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Integer overflow in %s number</dt>
<dd>
(W overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified either as a literal or as an argument to  <i>hex()</i> or <i>oct()</i> is too big for your architecture, and has been converted to a floating point number.  On a 32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation internally--subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent operations.</dd>

Missing command in piped open</dt>
<dd>
(W pipe) You used the &quot;open(FH, &quot;| command&quot;)&quot; or &quot;open(FH, &quot;command |&quot;)&quot; construction, but the command was missing or blank.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

(F) The indicated command line switch needs a mandatory argument, but you haven't specified one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No package name allowed for variable %s in &quot;our&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) Fully qualified variable names are not allowed in &quot;our&quot; declarations, because that doesn't make much sense under existing semantics.  Such syntax is reserved for future extensions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No space allowed after -%c</dt>
<dd>
(F) The argument to the indicated command line switch must follow immediately after the switch, without intervening spaces.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC</dt>
<dd>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl was unable to find the local timezone offset, so it's assuming that local system time is equivalent to UTC.  If it's not, define the logical name  <i>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</i> to translate to the number of seconds which need to be added to UTC to get local time.</dd>

when you meant<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my ($foo, $bar) = @_;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Remember that &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, and &quot;local&quot; bind tighter than comma.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Possible unintended interpolation of %s in string</dt>
<dd>
(W ambiguous) It used to be that Perl would try to guess whether you wanted an array interpolated or a literal @.  It no longer does this; arrays are now  <i>always</i> interpolated into strings.  This means that if you try something like:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        print &quot;fred@example.com&quot;;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
and the array @example doesn't exist, Perl is going to print &quot;fred.com&quot;, which is probably not what you wanted.  To get a literal &quot;@&quot; sign in a string, put a backslash before it, just as you would to get a literal &quot;$&quot; sign.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Possible Y2K bug: %s</dt>
<dd>
(W y2k) You are concatenating the number 19 with another number, which could be a potential Year 2000 problem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
pragma &quot;attrs&quot; is deprecated, use &quot;sub NAME : ATTRS&quot; instead</dt>
<dd>
(W deprecated) You have written something like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<br/>
    sub doit<br/>
    {<br/>
        use attrs qw(locked);<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You should use the new declaration syntax instead.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sub doit : locked<br/>
    {<br/>

(W internal) Warnings peculiar to VMS.  You tried to change or delete an element of the CRTL's internal environ array, but your copy of Perl wasn't built with a CRTL that contained the  <i>setenv()</i> function.

<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Perl Source Incompatibilities</h2> Beware that any new warnings that have been added or old ones that have been enhanced are  <b>not</b> considered incompatible changes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since all new warnings must be explicitly requested via the &quot;-w&quot; switch or the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma, it is ultimately the programmer's responsibility to ensure that warnings are enabled judiciously.<dl>
<dt>
CHECK is a new keyword</dt>
<dd>
All subroutine definitions named CHECK are now special.  See &quot;/&quot;Support for CHECK blocks&quot;&quot; for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Treatment of list slices of undef has changed</dt>
<dd>
There is a potential incompatibility in the behavior of list slices that are comprised entirely of undefined values. See &quot;Behavior of list slices is more consistent&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Format of $English::PERL_VERSION is different</dt>
<dd>
The English module now sets $PERL_VERSION to $^V (a string value) rather than $] (a numeric value).  This is a potential incompatibility. Send us a report via perlbug if you are affected by this.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;Improved Perl version numbering system&quot; for the reasons for this change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Literals of the form 1.2.3 parse differently</dt>
<dd>
Previously, numeric literals with more than one dot in them were interpreted as a floating point number concatenated with one or more numbers.  Such &quot;numbers&quot; are now parsed as strings composed of the specified ordinals.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For example, &quot;print 97.98.99&quot; used to output 97.9899 in earlier versions, but now prints &quot;abc&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;Support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Possibly changed pseudo-random number generator</dt>
<dd>
Perl programs that depend on reproducing a specific set of pseudo-random numbers may now produce different output due to improvements made to the  <i>rand()</i> builtin.  You can use &quot;sh Configure -Drandfunc=rand&quot; to obtain the old behavior.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;Better pseudo-random number generator&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Hashing function for hash keys has changed</dt>
<dd>
Even though Perl hashes are not order preserving, the apparently random order encountered when iterating on the contents of a hash is actually determined by the hashing algorithm used.  Improvements in the algorithm may yield a random order that is  <b>different</b> from that of previous versions, especially when iterating on hashes.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;Better worst-case behavior of hashes&quot; for additional information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;undef&quot; fails on read only values</dt>
<dd>
Using the &quot;undef&quot; operator on a readonly value (such as $1) has the same effect as assigning &quot;undef&quot; to the readonly value--it throws an exception.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Close-on-exec bit may be set on pipe and socket handles</dt>
<dd>
Pipe and socket handles are also now subject to the close-on-exec behavior determined by the special variable $^F.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;More consistent close-on-exec behavior&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Writing &quot;$$1&quot; to mean &quot;${$}1&quot; is unsupported</dt>
<dd>
Perl 5.004 deprecated the interpretation of $$1 and similar within interpolated strings to mean &quot;$$ . &quot;1&quot;&quot;, but still allowed it.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In Perl 5.6.0 and later, &quot;$$1&quot; always means &quot;${$1}&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>delete()</i>, <i>each()</i>, <i>values()</i> and &quot;\(%h)&quot;</dt>
<dd>
operate on aliases to values, not copies<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>delete()</i>, <i>each()</i>, <i>values()</i> and hashes (e.g. &quot;\(%h)&quot;) in a list context return the actual values in the hash, instead of copies (as they used to in earlier versions).  Typical idioms for using these constructs copy the returned values, but this can make a significant difference when creating references to the returned values.  Keys in the hash are still returned as copies when iterating on a hash.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See also &quot;<i>delete()</i>, <i>each()</i>, <i>values()</i> and hash iteration are faster&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
vec(EXPR,OFFSET,BITS) enforces powers-of-two BITS</dt>
<dd>
<i>vec()</i> generates a run-time error if the BITS argument is not a valid power-of-two integer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Text of some diagnostic output has changed</dt>
<dd>
Most references to internal Perl operations in diagnostics have been changed to be more descriptive.  This may be an issue for programs that may incorrectly rely on the exact text of diagnostics for proper functioning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;%@&quot; has been removed</dt>
<dd>
The undocumented special variable &quot;%@&quot; that used to accumulate &quot;background&quot; errors (such as those that happen in  <i>DESTROY()</i>) has been removed, because it could potentially result in memory leaks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Parenthesized <i>not()</i> behaves like a list operator</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;not&quot; operator now falls under the &quot;if it looks like a function, it behaves like a function&quot; rule.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As a result, the parenthesized form can be used with &quot;grep&quot; and &quot;map&quot;. The following construct used to be a syntax error before, but it works as expected now:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    grep not($_), @things;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On the other hand, using &quot;not&quot; with a literal list slice may not work.  The following previously allowed construct:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    print not (1,2,3)[0];<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
needs to be written with additional parentheses now:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    print not((1,2,3)[0]);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The behavior remains unaffected when &quot;not&quot; is not followed by parentheses.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Semantics of bareword prototype &quot;(*)&quot; have changed</dt>
<dd>
The semantics of the bareword prototype &quot;*&quot; have changed.  Perl 5.005 always coerced simple scalar arguments to a typeglob, which wasn't useful in situations where the subroutine must distinguish between a simple scalar and a typeglob.  The new behavior is to not coerce bareword arguments to a typeglob.  The value will always be visible as either a simple scalar or as a reference to a typeglob.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;More functional bareword prototype (*)&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Semantics of bit operators may have changed on 64-bit platforms</dt>
<dd>
If your platform is either natively 64-bit or if Perl has been configured to used 64-bit integers, i.e., $Config{ivsize} is 8, there may be a potential incompatibility in the behavior of bitwise numeric operators (&amp; | ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;).  These operators used to strictly operate on the lower 32 bits of integers in previous versions, but now operate over the entire native integral width.  In particular, note that unary &quot;~&quot; will produce different results on platforms that have different $Config{ivsize}.  For portability, be sure to mask off the excess bits in the result of unary &quot;~&quot;, e.g., &quot;~$x &amp; 0xffffffff&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;Bit operators support full native integer width&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
More builtins taint their results</dt>
<dd>
As described in &quot;Improved security features&quot;, there may be more sources of taint in a Perl program.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To avoid these new tainting behaviors, you can build Perl with the Configure option &quot;-Accflags=-DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS&quot;.  Beware that the ensuing perl binary may be insecure.</dd>

<h2>C Source Incompatibilities</h2><dl>
<dt>
&quot;PERL_POLLUTE&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Release 5.005 grandfathered old global symbol names by providing preprocessor macros for extension source compatibility.  As of release 5.6.0, these preprocessor definitions are not available by default.  You need to explicitly compile perl with &quot;-DPERL_POLLUTE&quot; to get these definitions.  For extensions still using the old symbols, this option can be specified via MakeMaker:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl Makefile.PL POLLUTE=1<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot;</dt>
<dd>
This new build option provides a set of macros for all API functions such that an implicit interpreter/thread context argument is passed to every API function.  As a result of this, something like &quot;sv_setsv(foo,bar)&quot; amounts to a macro invocation that actually translates to something like &quot;Perl_sv_setsv(my_perl,foo,bar)&quot;.  While this is generally expected to not have any significant source compatibility issues, the difference between a macro and a real function call will need to be considered.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This means that there <b>is</b> a source compatibility issue as a result of this if your extensions attempt to use pointers to any of the Perl API functions.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that the above issue is not relevant to the default build of Perl, whose interfaces continue to match those of prior versions (but subject to the other options described here).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;The Perl API&quot; in perlguts for detailed information on the ramifications of building Perl with this option.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    NOTE: PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT is automatically enabled whenever Perl is built<br/>
    with one of -Dusethreads, -Dusemultiplicity, or both.  It is not<br/>
    intended to be enabled by users at this time.<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;PERL_POLLUTE_MALLOC&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Enabling Perl's malloc in release 5.005 and earlier caused the namespace of the system's malloc family of functions to be usurped by the Perl versions, since by default they used the same names.  Besides causing problems on platforms that do not allow these functions to be cleanly replaced, this also meant that the system versions could not be called in programs that used Perl's malloc.  Previous versions of Perl have allowed this behaviour to be suppressed with the HIDEMYMALLOC and EMBEDMYMALLOC preprocessor definitions.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As of release 5.6.0, Perl's malloc family of functions have default names distinct from the system versions.  You need to explicitly compile perl with &quot;-DPERL_POLLUTE_MALLOC&quot; to get the older behaviour.  HIDEMYMALLOC and EMBEDMYMALLOC have no effect, since the behaviour they enabled is now the default.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that these functions do <b>not</b> constitute Perl's memory allocation API. See &quot;Memory Allocation&quot; in perlguts for further information about that.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Compatible C Source API Changes</h2><dl>
<dt>
&quot;PATCHLEVEL&quot; is now &quot;PERL_VERSION&quot;</dt>
<dd>
The cpp macros &quot;PERL_REVISION&quot;, &quot;PERL_VERSION&quot;, and &quot;PERL_SUBVERSION&quot; are now available by default from perl.h, and reflect the base revision, patchlevel, and subversion respectively.  &quot;PERL_REVISION&quot; had no prior equivalent, while &quot;PERL_VERSION&quot; and &quot;PERL_SUBVERSION&quot; were previously available as &quot;PATCHLEVEL&quot; and &quot;SUBVERSION&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The new names cause less pollution of the <b>cpp</b> namespace and reflect what the numbers have come to stand for in common practice.  For compatibility, the old names are still supported when  <i>patchlevel.h</i> is explicitly included (as required before), so there is no source incompatibility from the change.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Binary Incompatibilities</h2> In general, the default build of this release is expected to be binary compatible for extensions built with the 5.005 release or its maintenance versions.  However, specific platforms may have broken binary compatibility due to changes in the defaults used in hints files.  Therefore, please be sure to always check the platform-specific README files for any notes to the contrary.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The usethreads or usemultiplicity builds are <b>not</b> binary compatible with the corresponding builds in 5.005.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On platforms that require an explicit list of exports (AIX, OS/2 and Windows, among others), purely internal symbols such as parser functions and the run time opcodes are not exported by default.  Perl 5.005 used to export all functions irrespective of whether they were considered part of the public API or not.<div class="spacer">

The lib/io_multihomed test may hang in HP-UX if Perl has been configured to be 64-bit.  Because other 64-bit platforms do not hang in this test, HP-UX is suspect.  All other tests pass in 64-bit HP-UX.  The test attempts to create and connect to &quot;multihomed&quot; sockets (sockets which have multiple IP addresses).<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h2>EBCDIC platforms not fully supported</h2> In earlier releases of Perl, EBCDIC environments like OS390 (also known as Open Edition MVS) and VM-ESA were supported.  Due to changes required by the UTF-8 (Unicode) support, the EBCDIC platforms are not supported in Perl 5.6.0.<div class="spacer">

(W) A warning peculiar to VMS.  A logical name was encountered when preparing to iterate over %ENV which violates the syntactic rules governing logical names.  Because it cannot be translated normally, it is skipped, and will not appear in %ENV.  This may be a benign occurrence, as some software packages might directly modify logical name tables and introduce nonstandard names, or it may indicate that a logical name table has been corrupted.</dd>

In string, @%s now must be written as \@%s</dt>

The description of this error used to say:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        (Someday it will simply assume that an unbackslashed @<br/>
         interpolates an array.)<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
That day has come, and this fatal error has been removed.  It has been replaced by a non-fatal warning instead. See &quot;Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings&quot; for details.</dd>

<dt>
Probable precedence problem on %s</dt>
<dd>
(W) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    open FOO || die;<br/>

<dt>
regexp too big</dt>
<dd>
(F) The current implementation of regular expressions uses shorts as address offsets within a string.  Unfortunately this means that if the regular expression compiles to longer than 32767, it'll blow up. Usually when you want a regular expression this big, there is a better way to do it with multiple statements.  See perlre.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
Use of &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; to mean &quot;${$}&lt;digit&gt;&quot; is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D) Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type marker followed by &quot;$&quot; and a digit.  For example, &quot;$$0&quot; was incorrectly taken to mean &quot;${$}0&quot; instead of &quot;${$0}&quot;.  This bug is (mostly) fixed in Perl 5.004.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug completely, because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of &quot;$$0&quot; in a string.  So Perl 5.004 still interprets &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; in the old (broken) way inside strings; but it generates this message as a warning.  And in Perl 5.005, this special treatment will cease.</dd>
