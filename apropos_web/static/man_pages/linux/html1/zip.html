Note:  Command line processing in <i>zip</i> has been changed to support long options and handle all options and arguments more consistently.  Some old command lines that depend on command line inconsistencies may no longer work.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <i>zip</i> is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS, OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix, Atari, Macintosh, Amiga, and Acorn RISC OS.  It is analogous to a combination of the Unix commands <i>tar</i>(1) and <i>compress</i>(1) and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems).<div class="spacer">
</div>
A companion program (<i>unzip</i>(1)) unpacks <i>zip</i> archives. The <i>zip</i> and <i>unzip</i>(1) programs can work with archives produced by PKZIP (supporting most PKZIP features up to PKZIP version 4.6), and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work with archives produced by  <i>zip</i> (with some exceptions, notably streamed archives, but recent changes in the zip file standard may facilitate better compatibility). <i>zip</i> version 3.0 is compatible with PKZIP 2.04 and also supports the Zip64 extensions of PKZIP 4.5 which allow archives as well as files to exceed the previous 2 GB limit (4 GB in some cases).   <i>zip</i> also now supports <b>bzip2</b> compression if the  <b>bzip2</b> library is included when <i>zip</i> is compiled. Note that PKUNZIP 1.10 cannot extract files produced by PKZIP 2.04 or  <i>zip&#160;3.0</i>. You must use PKUNZIP 2.04g or  <i>unzip&#160;5.0p1</i> (or later versions) to extract them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section at the bottom of this page for examples of some typical uses of  <i>zip</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Large&#160;Archives&#160;and&#160;Zip64.</b> <i>zip</i> automatically uses the Zip64 extensions when files larger than 4 GB are added to an archive, an archive containing Zip64 entries is updated (if the resulting archive still needs Zip64), the size of the archive will exceed 4 GB, or when the number of entries in the archive will exceed about 64K. Zip64 is also used for archives streamed from standard input as the size of such archives are not known in advance, but the option  <b>-fz-</b> can be used to force  <i>zip</i> to create PKZIP 2 compatible archives (as long as Zip64 extensions are not needed).  You must use a PKZIP 4.5 compatible unzip, such as  <i>unzip&#160;6.0</i> or later, to extract files using the Zip64 extensions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In addition, streamed archives, entries encrypted with standard encryption, or split archives created with the pause option may not be compatible with PKZIP as data descriptors are used and PKZIP at the time of this writing does not support data descriptors (but recent changes in the PKWare published zip standard now include some support for the data descriptor format  <i>zip</i> uses).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Mac OS X.</b>  Though previous Mac versions had their own <i>zip</i> port,  <i>zip</i> supports Mac OS X as part of the Unix port and most Unix features apply.  References to &quot;MacOS&quot; below generally refer to MacOS versions older than OS X.  Support for some Mac OS features in the Unix Mac OS X port, such as resource forks, is expected in the next  <i>zip</i> release.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div class="section">
<h1>USE</h1> The program is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution; for archiving files; and for saving disk space by temporarily compressing unused files or directories.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>zip</i> program puts one or more compressed files into a single <i>zip</i> archive, along with information about the files (name, path, date, time of last modification, protection, and check information to verify file integrity). An entire directory structure can be packed into a <i>zip</i> archive with a single command. Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common for text files. <i>zip</i> has one compression method (deflation) and can also store files without compression.  (If  <b>bzip2</b> support is added, <i>zip</i> can also compress using  <b>bzip2</b> compression, but such entries require a reasonably modern unzip to decompress.  When  <b>bzip2</b> compression is selected, it replaces deflation as the default method.) <i>zip</i> automatically chooses the better of the two (deflation or store or, if  <b>bzip2</b> is selected, <b>bzip2</b> or store) for each file to be compressed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Command&#160;format.</b>  The basic command format is<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>zip</b> options archive inpath inpath ...</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
where <b>archive</b> is a new or existing <i>zip</i> archive and  <b>inpath</b> is a directory or file path optionally including wildcards. When given the name of an existing <i>zip</i> archive, <i>zip</i> will replace identically named entries in the <i>zip</i> archive (matching the relative names as stored in the archive) or add entries for new names. For example, if <i>foo.zip</i> exists and contains <i>foo/file1</i> and <i>foo/file2</i>, and the directory <i>foo</i> contains the files <i>foo/file1</i> and <i>foo/file3</i>, then:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip -r foo.zip foo</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
or more concisely<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip -r foo foo</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
will replace <i>foo/file1</i> in <i>foo.zip</i> and add <i>foo/file3</i> to <i>foo.zip</i>. After this, <i>foo.zip</i> contains <i>foo/file1</i>, <i>foo/file2</i>, and <i>foo/file3</i>, with <i>foo/file2</i> unchanged from before.<div class="spacer">
</div>
So if before the zip command is executed <i>foo.zip</i> has:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
 foo/file1 foo/file2</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
and directory foo has:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
 file1 file3</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
then <i>foo.zip</i> will have:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
 foo/file1 foo/file2 foo/file3</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
where <i>foo/file1</i> is replaced and  <i>foo/file3</i> is new.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>-@&#160;file&#160;lists.</b>  If a file list is specified as  <b>-@</b> [Not on MacOS], <i>zip</i> takes the list of input files from standard input instead of from the command line.  For example,<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip -@ foo</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
will store the files listed one per line on stdin in <i>foo.zip</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Under Unix, this option can be used to powerful effect in conjunction with the  <i>find</i>&#160;(1) command. For example, to archive all the C source files in the current directory and its subdirectories:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
find . -name &quot;*.[ch]&quot; -print | zip source -@</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(note that the pattern must be quoted to keep the shell from expanding it).<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Streaming&#160;input&#160;and&#160;output.</b> <i>zip</i> will also accept a single dash (&quot;-&quot;) as the zip file name, in which case it will write the zip file to standard output, allowing the output to be piped to another program. For example:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
would write the zip output directly to a tape with the specified block size for the purpose of backing up the current directory.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>zip</i> also accepts a single dash (&quot;-&quot;) as the name of a file to be compressed, in which case it will read the file from standard input, allowing zip to take input from another program. For example:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
tar cf - . | zip backup -</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
would compress the output of the tar command for the purpose of backing up the current directory. This generally produces better compression than the previous example using the -r option because <i>zip</i> can take advantage of redundancy between files. The backup can be restored using the command<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
unzip -p backup | tar xf -</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a terminal, <i>zip</i> acts as a filter, compressing standard input to standard output. For example,<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
tar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
is equivalent to<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
tar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>zip</i> archives created in this manner can be extracted with the program <i>funzip</i> which is provided in the <i>unzip</i> package, or by <i>gunzip</i> which is provided in the <i>gzip</i> package (but some <i>gunzip</i> may not support this if <i>zip</i> used the Zip64 extensions). For example:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
dd if=/dev/nrst0  ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The stream can also be saved to a file and <i>unzip</i> used.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If Zip64 support for large files and archives is enabled and  <i>zip</i> is used as a filter, <i>zip</i> creates a Zip64 archive that requires a PKZIP 4.5 or later compatible unzip to read it.  This is to avoid amgibuities in the zip file structure as defined in the current zip standard (PKWARE AppNote) where the decision to use Zip64 needs to be made before data is written for the entry, but for a stream the size of the data is not known at that point.  If the data is known to be smaller than 4 GB, the option  <b>-fz-</b> can be used to prevent use of Zip64, but  <i>zip</i> will exit with an error if Zip64 was in fact needed.  <i>zip&#160;3</i> and <i>unzip&#160;6</i> and later can read archives with Zip64 entries.  Also,  <i>zip</i> removes the Zip64 extensions if not needed when archive entries are copied (see the  <b>-U</b> (<b>--copy</b>) option).<div class="spacer">
</div>
When directing the output to another file, note that all options should be before the redirection including  <b>-x</b>.  For example:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>zip archive &quot;*.h&quot; &quot;*.c&quot; -x donotinclude.h orthis.h &gt; tofile</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Zip&#160;files.</b>  When changing an existing <i>zip</i> archive, <i>zip</i> will write a temporary file with the new contents, and only replace the old one when the process of creating the new version has been completed without error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the name of the <i>zip</i> archive does not contain an extension, the extension  <b>.zip</b> is added. If the name already contains an extension other than  <b>.zip</b>, the existing extension is kept unchanged.  However, split archives (archives split over multiple files) require the  <b>.zip</b> extension on the last split.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Scanning&#160;and&#160;reading&#160;files.</b> When  <i>zip</i> starts, it scans for files to process (if needed).  If this scan takes longer than about 5 seconds,  <i>zip</i> will display a &quot;Scanning files&quot; message and start displaying progress dots every 2 seconds or every so many entries processed, whichever takes longer.  If there is more than 2 seconds between dots it could indicate that finding each file is taking time and could mean a slow network connection for example. (Actually the initial file scan is a two-step process where the directory scan is followed by a sort and these two steps are separated with a space in the dots.  If updating an existing archive, a space also appears between the existing file scan and the new file scan.)  The scanning files dots are not controlled by the  <b>-ds</b> dot size option, but the dots are turned off by the  <b>-q</b> quiet option.  The  <b>-sf</b> show files option can be used to scan for files and get the list of files scanned without actually processing them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>zip</i> is not able to read a file, it issues a warning but continues.  See the  <b>-MM</b> option below for more on how <i>zip</i> handles patterns that are not matched and files that are not readable. If some files were skipped, a warning is issued at the end of the zip operation noting how many files were read and how many skipped.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Command&#160;modes.</b>  <i>zip</i> now supports two distinct types of command modes,  <b>external</b> and <b>internal</b>.  The <b>external</b> modes (add, update, and freshen) read files from the file system (as well as from an existing archive) while the  <b>internal</b> modes (delete and copy) operate exclusively on entries in an existing archive.<dl>
<dt>
<b>add&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b></dt>
<dd>
Update existing entries and add new files.  If the archive does not exist create it.  This is the default mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>update&#160;<b>(</b><b>-u</b><b>)</b></b></dt>
<dd>
Update existing entries if newer on the file system and add new files.  If the archive does not exist issue warning then create a new archive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>freshen&#160;<b>(</b><b>-f</b><b>)</b></b></dt>
<dd>
Update existing entries of an archive if newer on the file system. Does not add new files to the archive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>delete&#160;<b>(</b><b>-d</b><b>)</b></b></dt>
<dd>
Select entries in an existing archive and delete them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>copy&#160;<b>(</b><b>-U</b><b>)</b></b></dt>
<dd>
Select entries in an existing archive and copy them to a new archive. This new mode is similar to  <b>update</b> but command line patterns select entries in the existing archive rather than files from the file system and it uses the  <b>--out</b> option to write the resulting archive to a new file rather than update the existing archive, leaving the original archive unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The new File Sync option (<b>-FS</b>) is also considered a new mode, though it is similar to  <b>update</b>.  This mode synchronizes the archive with the files on the OS, only replacing files in the archive if the file time or size of the OS file is different, adding new files, and deleting entries from the archive where there is no matching file.  As this mode can delete entries from the archive, consider making a backup copy of the archive.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Also see <b>-DF</b> for creating difference archives.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See each option description below for details and the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section below for examples.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Split&#160;archives.</b>  <i>zip</i> version 3.0 and later can create split archives.  A  <b>split archive</b> is a standard zip archive split over multiple files.  (Note that split archives are not just archives split in to pieces, as the offsets of entries are now based on the start of each split.  Concatenating the pieces together will invalidate these offsets, but  <i>unzip</i> can usually deal with it.  <i>zip</i> will usually refuse to process such a spliced archive unless the  <b>-FF</b> fix option is used to fix the offsets.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
One use of split archives is storing a large archive on multiple removable media. For a split archive with 20 split files the files are typically named (replace ARCHIVE with the name of your archive) ARCHIVE.z01, ARCHIVE.z02, ..., ARCHIVE.z19, ARCHIVE.zip.  Note that the last file is the  <b>.zip</b> file.  In contrast,  <b>spanned archives</b> are the original multi-disk archive generally requiring floppy disks and using volume labels to store disk numbers.   <i>zip</i> supports split archives but not spanned archives, though a procedure exists for converting split archives of the right size to spanned archives.  The reverse is also true, where each file of a spanned archive can be copied in order to files with the above names to create a split archive.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Use <b>-s</b> to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB) (the default is m).  The  <b>-sp</b> option can be used to pause <i>zip</i> between splits to allow changing removable media, for example, but read the descriptions and warnings for both  <b>-s</b> and <b>-sp</b> below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Though <i>zip</i> does not update split archives, <i>zip</i> provides the new option  <b>-O</b> (<b>--output-file</b> or <b>--out</b>) to allow split archives to be updated and saved in a new archive.  For example,<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
reads archive <b>inarchive.zip</b>, even if split, adds the files <b>foo.c</b> and  <b>bar.c</b>, and writes the resulting archive to <b>outarchive.zip</b>.  If  <b>inarchive.zip</b> is split then <b>outarchive.zip</b> defaults to the same split size.  Be aware that if  <b>outarchive.zip</b> and any split files that are created with it already exist, these are always overwritten as needed without warning.  This may be changed in the future.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Unicode.</b>  Though the zip standard requires storing paths in an archive using a specific character set, in practice zips have stored paths in archives in whatever the local character set is.  This creates problems when an archive is created or updated on a system using one character set and then extracted on another system using a different character set.  When compiled with Unicode support enabled on platforms that support wide characters,  <i>zip</i> now stores, in addition to the standard local path for backward compatibility, the UTF-8 translation of the path. This provides a common universal character set for storing paths that allows these paths to be fully extracted on other systems that support Unicode and to match as close as possible on systems that don't.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On Win32 systems where paths are internally stored as Unicode but represented in the local character set, it's possible that some paths will be skipped during a local character set directory scan.   <i>zip</i> with Unicode support now can read and store these paths.  Note that Win 9x systems and FAT file systems don't fully support Unicode.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Be aware that console windows on Win32 and Unix, for example, sometimes don't accurately show all characters due to how each operating system switches in character sets for display.  However, directory navigation tools should show the correct paths if the needed fonts are loaded.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Command line format.</b>  This version of <i>zip</i> has updated command line processing and support for long options.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Short options take the form<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
-s[-][s[-]...][value][=value][&#160;value]</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
where s is a one or two character short option.  A short option that takes a value is last in an argument and anything after it is taken as the value.  If the option can be negated and &quot;-&quot; immediately follows the option, the option is negated. Short options can also be given as separate arguments<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
-s[-][value][=value][&#160;value]&#160;-s[-][value][=value][&#160;value]&#160;...</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Short options in general take values either as part of the same argument or as the following argument.  An optional = is also supported. So<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
-ttmmddyyyy</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
and<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
-tt=mmddyyyy</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
and<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
-tt mmddyyyy</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
all work.  The <b>-x</b> and <b>-i</b> options accept lists of values and use a slightly different format described below.  See the  <b>-x</b> and <b>-i</b> options.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Long options take the form<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
--longoption[-][=value][ value]</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
where the option starts with --, has a multicharacter name, can include a trailing dash to negate the option (if the option supports it), and can have a value (option argument) specified by preceding it with = (no spaces).  Values can also follow the argument.  So<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
--before-date=mmddyyyy</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
and<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
--before-date mmddyyyy</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
both work.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Long option names can be shortened to the shortest unique abbreviation.  See the option descriptions below for which support long options.  To avoid confusion, avoid abbreviating a negatable option with an embedded dash (&quot;-&quot;) at the dash if you plan to negate it (the parser would consider a trailing dash, such as for the option  <b>--some-option</b> using  <b>--some-</b> as the option, as part of the name rather than a negating dash).  This may be changed to force the last dash in  <b>--some-</b> to be negating in the future.</div>

<dd>
will remove the entry <i>foo/tom/junk</i>, all of the files that start with <i>foo/harry/</i>, and all of the files that end with <b>.o</b> (in any path). Note that shell pathname expansion has been inhibited with backslashes, so that <i>zip</i> can see the asterisks, enabling <i>zip</i> to match on the contents of the <i>zip</i> archive instead of the contents of the current directory. (The backslashes are not used on MSDOS-based platforms.) Can also use quotes to escape the asterisks as in</dd>

Under MSDOS, <b>-d</b> is case sensitive when it matches names in the <i>zip</i> archive. This requires that file names be entered in upper case if they were zipped by PKZIP on an MSDOS system.  (We considered making this case insensitive on systems where paths were case insensitive, but it is possible the archive came from a system where case does matter and the archive could include both  <b>Bar</b> and <b>bar</b> as separate files in the archive.)

<b>--no-dir-entries</b> Do not create entries in the <i>zip</i> archive for directories.  Directory entries are created by default so that their attributes can be saved in the zip archive.

<dd>

<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
(The variable ZIPOPT can be used for any option, including <b>-i</b> and <b>-x</b> using a new option format detailed below, and can include several options.) The option <b>-D</b> is a shorthand for <b>-x</b> &quot;*/&quot; but the latter previously could not be set as default in the ZIPOPT environment variable as the contents of ZIPOPT gets inserted near the beginning of the command line and the file list had to end at the end of the line.</dd>

<b>--difference-archive</b> Create an archive that contains all new and changed files since the original archive was created.  For this to work, the input file list and current directory must be the same as during the original  <i>zip</i> operation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
For example, if the existing archive was created using</dd>

<dt>
</dt>

zip -r foofull .</dd>

&#160;</div>
Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to the local timezone in order for this option to work correctly.  A change in timezone since the original archive was created could result in no times matching and all files being included.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<b>--freshen</b> Replace (freshen) an existing entry in the <i>zip</i> archive only if it has been modified more recently than the version already in the <i>zip</i> archive; unlike the update option (<b>-u</b>) this will not add files that are not already in the <i>zip</i> archive. For example:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip -f foo</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This command should be run from the same directory from which the original <i>zip</i> command was run, since paths stored in <i>zip</i> archives are always relative.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to the local timezone in order for the  <b>-f</b>, <b>-u</b> and <b>-o</b> options to work correctly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The reasons behind this are somewhat subtle but have to do with the differences between the Unix-format file times (always in GMT) and most of the other operating systems (always local time) and the necessity to compare the two. A typical TZ value is ``MET-1MEST'' (Middle European time with automatic adjustment for ``summertime'' or Daylight Savings Time).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The format is TTThhDDD, where TTT is the time zone such as MET, hh is the difference between GMT and local time such as -1 above, and DDD is the time zone when daylight savings time is in effect.  Leave off the DDD if there is no daylight savings time.  For the US Eastern time zone EST5EDT.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<b>--fixfix&#160;&#160;</b> Fix the <i>zip</i> archive. The  <b>-F</b> option can be used if some portions of the archive are missing, but requires a reasonably intact central directory. The input archive is scanned as usual, but  <i>zip</i> will ignore some problems.  The resulting archive should be valid, but any inconsistent entries will be left out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When doubled as in  <b>-FF</b>, the archive is scanned from the beginning and  <i>zip</i> scans for special signatures to identify the limits between the archive members. The single <b>-F</b> is more reliable if the archive is not too much damaged, so try this option first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If the archive is too damaged or the end has been truncated, you must use  <b>-FF</b>.  This is a change from <i>zip&#160;2.32</i>, where the  <b>-F</b> option is able to read a truncated archive.  The  <b>-F</b> option now more reliably fixes archives with minor damage and the  <b>-FF</b> option is needed to fix archives where  <b>-F</b> might have been sufficient before.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Neither option will recover archives that have been incorrectly transferred in ascii mode instead of binary. After the repair, the <b>-t</b> option of <i>unzip</i> may show that some files have a bad CRC. Such files cannot be recovered; you can remove them from the archive using the <b>-d</b> option of  <i>zip</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Note that <b>-FF</b> may have trouble fixing archives that include an embedded zip archive that was stored (without compression) in the archive and, depending on the damage, it may find the entries in the embedded archive rather than the archive itself.  Try  <b>-F</b> first as it does not have this problem.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
The format of the fix commands have changed.  For example, to fix the damaged archive  <i>foo.zip</i>,</dd>

</dt>
<dd>
zip -F foo --out foofix</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
tries to read the entries normally, copying good entries to the new archive  <i>foofix.zip</i>.  If this doesn't work, as when the archive is truncated, or if some entries you know are in the archive are missed, then try</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip -FF foo --out foofixfix</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
and compare the resulting archive to the archive created by <b>-F</b>.  The  <b>-FF</b> option may create an inconsistent archive.  Depending on what is damaged, you can then use the  <b>-F</b> option to fix that archive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
A split archive with missing split files can be fixed using  <b>-F</b> if you have the last split of the archive (the <b>.zip</b> file). If this file is missing, you must use  <b>-FF</b> to fix the archive, which will prompt you for the splits you have.</dd>
</dl>

<b>--filesync</b> Synchronize the contents of an archive with the files on the OS. Normally when an archive is updated, new files are added and changed files are updated but files that no longer exist on the OS are not deleted from the archive.  This option enables a new mode that checks entries in the archive against the file system.  If the file time and file size of the entry matches that of the OS file, the entry is copied from the old archive instead of being read from the file system and compressed.  If the OS file has changed, the entry is read and compressed as usual.  If the entry in the archive does not match a file on the OS, the entry is deleted.  Enabling this option should create archives that are the same as new archives, but since existing entries are copied instead of compressed, updating an existing archive with  <b>-FS</b> can be much faster than creating a new archive.  Also consider using  <b>-u</b> for updating an archive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
For this option to work, the archive should be updated from the same directory it was created in so the relative paths match.  If few files are being copied from the old archive, it may be faster to create a new archive instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to the local timezone in order for this option to work correctly.  A change in timezone since the original archive was created could result in no times matching and recompression of all files.</dd>

<dd>
This option deletes files from the archive.  If you need to preserve the original archive, make a copy of the archive first or use the  <b>--out</b> option to output the updated archive to a new file.

The list of files terminates at the next argument starting with  <b>-</b>, the end of the command line, or the list terminator  <b>@</b> (an argument that is just @).  So the above can be given as</dd>

as additional examples.  The single value forms are not recommended because they can be confusing and, in particular, the  <b>-ifile</b> format can cause problems if the first letter of  <b>file</b> combines with  <b>i</b> to form a two-letter option starting with  <b>i</b>.  Use <b>-sc</b> to see how your command line will be parsed.</dd>

For example, if you have SparkFS loaded, zipping a Spark archive will result in a zipfile containing a directory (and its content) while using the 'I' option will result in a zipfile containing a Spark archive.

<b>--ignore-case</b> [VMS, WIN32] Ignore case when matching archive entries.  This option is only available on systems where the case of files is ignored.  On systems with case-insensitive file systems, case is normally ignored when matching files on the file system but is not ignored for -f (freshen), -d (delete), -U (copy), and similar modes when matching against archive entries (currently -f ignores case on VMS) because archive entries can be from systems where case does matter and names that are the same except for case can exist in an archive.  The  <b>-ic</b> option makes all matching case insensitive. This can result in multiple archive entries matching a command line pattern.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

If the file is converted and the file is later determined to be binary a warning is issued and the file is probably corrupted.  In this release if  <b>-ll</b> detects binary in the first buffer read from a file,  <i>zip</i> now issues a warning and skips line end conversion on the file.  This check seems to catch all binary files tested, but the original check remains and if a converted file is later determined to be binary that warning is still issued.

<b>--move &#160;&#160;&#160;</b> Move the specified files into the <i>zip</i> archive; actually, this deletes the target directories/files after making the specified <i>zip</i> archive. If a directory becomes empty after removal of the files, the directory is also removed. No deletions are done until <i>zip</i> has created the archive without error.

<b>--must-match</b> All input patterns must match at least one file and all input files found must be readable.  Normally when an input pattern does not match a file the &quot;name not matched&quot; warning is issued and when an input file has been found but later is missing or not readable a missing or not readable warning is issued.  In either case <i>zip</i> continues creating the archive, with missing or unreadable new files being skipped and files already in the archive remaining unchanged. After the archive is created, if any files were not readable <i>zip</i> returns the OPEN error code (18 on most systems) instead of the normal success return (0 on most systems).  With  <b>-MM</b> set, <i>zip</i> exits as soon as an input pattern is not matched (whenever the &quot;name not matched&quot; warning would be issued) or when an input file is not readable.  In either case  <i>zip</i> exits with an OPEN error and no archive is created.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

This option is useful when a known list of files is to be zipped so any missing or unreadable files will result in an error.  It is less useful when used with wildcards, but  <i>zip</i> will still exit with an error if any input pattern doesn't match at least one file and if any matched files are unreadable.  If you want to create the archive anyway and only need to know if files were skipped, don't use <b>-MM</b> and just check the return code.  Also  <b>-lf</b> could be useful.</dd>

<b>--suffixes&#160;suffixes</b> Do not attempt to compress files named with the given  <b>suffixes</b>. Such files are simply stored (0% compression) in the output zip file, so that <i>zip</i> doesn't waste its time trying to compress them. The suffixes are separated by either colons or semicolons.  For example:</dd>

will copy everything from <i>foo</i> into <i>foo.zip</i>, but will store any files that end in <i>.Z</i>, <i>.zip</i>, <i>.tiff</i>, <i>.gif</i>, or <i>.snd</i> without trying to compress them (image and sound files often have their own specialized compression methods). By default, <i>zip</i> does not compress files with extensions in the list <i>.Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj.</i> Such files are stored directly in the output archive. The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default options. For example under Unix with csh:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>

<dd>
setenv ZIPOPT &quot;-n .gif:.zip&quot;</dd>

This option can be used to create updated split archives. It can also be used with  <b>-U</b> to copy entries from an existing archive to a new archive.  See the  <b>EXAMPLES</b> section below.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Another use is converting <i>zip</i> files from one split size to another.  For instance, to convert an archive with 700 MB CD splits to one with 2 GB DVD splits, can use:</dd>

</dt>

will convert a split archive to a single-file archive.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Copy mode will convert stream entries (using data descriptors and which should be compatible with most unzips) to normal entries (which should be compatible with all unzips), except if standard encryption was used.

Storing the plaintext password as part of a command line in an automated script is even worse. Whenever possible, use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter passwords.

<dd>
zip -r foo foo</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl>

</dt>
<dd>
In this case, all the files and directories in <b>foo</b> are saved in a <i>zip</i> archive named  <b>foo.zip</b>, including files with names starting with  <b>&quot;.&quot;</b>, since the recursion does not use the shell's file-name substitution mechanism. If you wish to include only a specific subset of the files in directory  <b>foo</b> and its subdirectories, use the  <b>-i</b> option to specify the pattern of files to be included. You should not use  <b>-r</b> with the name  <b>&quot;.*&quot;</b>, since that matches  <b>&quot;..&quot;</b> which will attempt to zip up the parent directory (probably not what was intended).</dd>

<dd>
Note that while wildcards to <b>-r</b> are typically resolved while recursing down directories in the file system, any  <b>-R</b>, <b>-x</b>, and <b>-i</b> wildcards are applied to internal archive pathnames once the directories are scanned. To have wildcards apply to files in subdirectories when recursing on Unix and similar systems where the shell does wildcard substitution, either escape all wildcards or put all arguments with wildcards in quotes.  This lets  <i>zip</i> see the wildcards and match files in subdirectories using them as it recurses.</dd>

</dt>
<dd>
zip -R foo &quot;*.c&quot;</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
In this case, all the files matching <b>*.c</b> in the tree starting at the current directory are stored into a <i>zip</i> archive named  <b>foo.zip</b>. Note that  <b>*.c</b> will match <b>file.c</b>, <b>a/file.c</b> and  <b>a/b/.c</b>.  More than one pattern can be listed as separate arguments. Note for PKZIP users: the equivalent command is</dd>

<b>--split-size&#160;<i>splitsize</i></b>  <i>Enable creating a split archive and set the split size.  A split archive is an archive</i>  <i>that could be split over many files.  As the archive is created, if the size of the</i>  <i>archive reaches the specified split size, that split is closed and the next split</i>  <i>opened.  In general all splits but the last will be the split size and the last</i>  <i>will be whatever is left.  If the entire archive is smaller than the split size a</i>  <i>single-file archive is created.</i><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Split archives are stored in numbered files.  For example, if the output archive is named  <b>archive</b> and three splits are required, the resulting archive will be in the three files  <b>archive.z01</b>, <b>archive.z02</b>, and  <b>archive.zip</b>.  Do not change the numbering of these files or the archive will not be readable as these are used to determine the order the splits are read.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Split size is a number optionally followed by a multiplier.  Currently the number must be an integer.  The multiplier can currently be one of  <b>k</b> (kilobytes), <b>m</b> (megabytes), <b>g</b> (gigabytes), or <b>t</b> (terabytes).  As 64k is the minimum split size, numbers without multipliers default to megabytes.  For example, to create a split archive called  <b>foo</b> with the contents of the  <b>bar</b> directory with splits of 670 MB that might be useful for burning on CDs, the command:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

<dd>
zip -s 670m -r foo bar</dd>
</dl>

could be used.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Currently the old splits of a split archive are not excluded from a new archive, but they can be specifically excluded.  If possible, keep the input and output archives out of the path being zipped when creating split archives.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Using <b>-s</b> without <b>-sp</b> as above creates all the splits where  <b>foo</b> is being written, in this case the current directory.  This split mode updates the splits as the archive is being created, requiring all splits to remain writable, but creates split archives that are readable by any unzip that supports split archives.  See  <b>-sp</b> below for enabling split pause mode which allows splits to be written directly to removable media.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The option <b>-sv</b> can be used to enable verbose splitting and provide details of how the splitting is being done.  The  <b>-sb</b> option can be used to ring the bell when  <i>zip</i> pauses for the next split destination.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Split archives cannot be updated, but see the <b>-O</b> (<b>--out</b>) option for how a split archive can be updated as it is copied to a new archive. A split archive can also be converted into a single-file archive using a split size of 0 or negating the  <b>-s</b> option:</dd>

<b>--copy-entries</b> Copy entries from one archive to another.  Requires the  <b>--out</b> option to specify a different output file than the input archive.  Copy mode is the reverse of  <b>-d</b> delete.  When delete is being used with  <b>--out</b>, the selected entries are deleted from the archive and all other entries are copied to the new archive, while copy mode selects the files to include in the new archive.  Unlike  <b>-u</b> update, input patterns on the command line are matched against archive entries only and not the file system files.  For instance,</dd>

<b>--unicode&#160;v</b> Determine what  <i>zip</i> should do with Unicode file names.  <i>zip&#160;3.0</i>, in addition to the standard file path, now includes the UTF-8 translation of the path if the entry path is not entirely 7-bit ASCII.  When an entry is missing the Unicode path,  <i>zip</i> reverts back to the standard file path.  The problem with using the standard path is this path is in the local character set of the zip that created the entry, which may contain characters that are not valid in the character set being used by the unzip.  When  <i>zip</i> is reading an archive, if an entry also has a Unicode path,  <i>zip</i> now defaults to using the Unicode path to recreate the standard path using the current local character set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

This option can be used to determine what <i>zip</i> should do with this path if there is a mismatch between the stored standard path and the stored UTF-8 path (which can happen if the standard path was updated).

<b>--no-extra</b> Do not save extra file attributes (Extended Attributes on OS/2, uid/gid and file times on Unix).  The zip format uses extra fields to include additional information for each entry.  Some extra fields are specific to particular systems while others are applicable to all systems. Normally when  <i>zip</i> reads entries from an existing archive, it reads the extra fields it knows, strips the rest, and adds the extra fields applicable to that system.  With  <b>-X</b>, <i>zip</i> strips all old fields and only includes the Unicode and Zip64 extra fields (currently these two extra fields cannot be disabled).<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<b>--symlinks</b> For UNIX and VMS (V8.3 and later), store symbolic links as such in the <i>zip</i> archive, instead of compressing and storing the file referred to by the link.

<b>--compression-method&#160;cm</b> Set the default compression method.  Currently the main methods supported by  <i>zip</i> are <b>store</b> and <b>deflate</b>.  Compression method can be set to:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>store</b> - Setting the compression method to <b>store</b> forces  <i>zip</i> to store entries with no compression.  This is generally faster than compressing entries, but results in no space savings. This is the same as using  <b>-0</b> (compression level zero).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>deflate</b> - This is the default method for <i>zip</i>.  If <i>zip</i> determines that storing is better than deflation, the entry will be stored instead.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>bzip2</b> - If <b>bzip2</b> support is compiled in, this compression method also becomes available.  Only some modern unzips currently support the  <b>bzip2</b> compression method, so test the unzip you will be using before relying on archives using this method (compression method 12).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For example, to add <b>bar.c</b> to archive <b>foo</b> using <b>bzip2</b> compression:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

<dt>
</dt>

<b>(-0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9)</b> Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit <b>#</b>, where <b>-0</b> indicates no compression (store all files), <b>-1</b> indicates the fastest compression speed (less compression) and <b>-9</b> indicates the slowest compression speed (optimal compression, ignores the suffix list). The default compression level is <b>-6.</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> The simplest example:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip stuff *</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
creates the archive <i>stuff.zip</i> (assuming it does not exist) and puts all the files in the current directory in it, in compressed form (the  <b>.zip</b> suffix is added automatically, unless the archive name contains a dot already; this allows the explicit specification of other suffixes).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Because of the way the shell on Unix does filename substitution, files starting with &quot;.&quot; are not included; to include these as well:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip stuff .* *</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Even this will not include any subdirectories from the current directory.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To zip up an entire directory, the command:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip -r foo foo</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
creates the archive <i>foo.zip</i>, containing all the files and directories in the directory <i>foo</i> that is contained within the current directory.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may want to make a <i>zip</i> archive that contains the files in <i>foo</i>, without recording the directory name, <i>foo</i>. You can use the <b>-j</b> option to leave off the paths, as in:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip -j foo foo/*</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are short on disk space, you might not have enough room to hold both the original directory and the corresponding compressed <i>zip</i> archive. In this case, you can create the archive in steps using the <b>-m</b> option. If <i>foo</i> contains the subdirectories <i>tom</i>, <i>dick</i>, and <i>harry</i>, you can:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip -rm foo foo/tom<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
zip -rm foo foo/dick<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
zip -rm foo foo/harry</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
where the first command creates <i>foo.zip</i>, and the next two add to it. At the completion of each <i>zip</i> command, the last created archive is deleted, making room for the next <i>zip</i> command to function.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Use <b>-s</b> to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB). The command<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip -s 2g -r split.zip foo</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
creates a split archive of the directory foo with splits no bigger than 2&#160;GB each.  If foo contained 5&#160;GB of contents and the contents were stored in the split archive without compression (to make this example simple), this would create three splits, split.z01 at 2&#160;GB, split.z02 at 2&#160;GB, and split.zip at a little over 1&#160;GB.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-sp</b> option can be used to pause <i>zip</i> between splits to allow changing removable media, for example, but read the descriptions and warnings for both  <b>-s</b> and  <b>-sp</b> below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Though <i>zip</i> does not update split archives, <i>zip</i> provides the new option <b>-O</b> ( <b>--output-file</b>) to allow split archives to be updated and saved in a new archive.  For example,<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
reads archive <b>inarchive.zip</b>, even if split, adds the files <b>foo.c</b> and  <b>bar.c</b>, and writes the resulting archive to <b>outarchive.zip</b>.  If  <b>inarchive.zip</b> is split then <b>outarchive.zip</b> defaults to the same split size.  Be aware that  <b>outarchive.zip</b> and any split files that are created with it are always overwritten without warning.  This may be changed in the future.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h1>PATTERN MATCHING</h1> This section applies only to Unix. Watch this space for details on MSDOS and VMS operation. However, the special wildcard characters  <b>*</b> and <b>[]</b> below apply to at least MSDOS also.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Unix shells (<i>sh</i>, <i>csh</i>, <i>bash</i>, and others) normally do filename substitution (also called &quot;globbing&quot;) on command arguments. Generally the special characters are:<dl>
<dt>
<b>?</b></dt>
<dd>
match any single character</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>*</b></dt>
<dd>
match any number of characters (including none)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>[]</b></dt>
<dd>
match any character in the range indicated within the brackets (example: [a-f], [0-9]).  This form of wildcard matching allows a user to specify a list of characters between square brackets and if any of the characters match the expression matches.  For example:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip archive &quot;*.[hc]&quot;</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
would archive all files in the current directory that end in  <b>.h</b> or <b>.c</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Ranges of characters are supported:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip archive &quot;[a-f]*&quot;</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
would add to the archive all files starting with &quot;a&quot; through &quot;f&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Negation is also supported, where any character in that position not in the list matches.  Negation is supported by adding  <b>!</b> or <b>^</b> to the beginning of the list:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
zip archive &quot;*.[!o]&quot;</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
matches files that don't end in &quot;.o&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On WIN32, [] matching needs to be turned on with the -RE option to avoid the confusion that names with [ or ] have caused.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When these characters are encountered (without being escaped with a backslash or quotes), the shell will look for files relative to the current path that match the pattern, and replace the argument with a list of the names that matched.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>zip</i> program can do the same matching on names that are in the <i>zip</i> archive being modified or, in the case of the <b>-x</b> (exclude) or <b>-i</b> (include) options, on the list of files to be operated on, by using backslashes or quotes to tell the shell not to do the name expansion. In general, when <i>zip</i> encounters a name in the list of files to do, it first looks for the name in the file system.  If it finds it, it then adds it to the list of files to do. If it does not find it, it looks for the name in the <i>zip</i> archive being modified (if it exists), using the pattern matching characters described above, if present.  For each match, it will add that name to the list of files to be processed, unless this name matches one given with the <b>-x</b> option, or does not match any name given with the <b>-i</b> option.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The pattern matching includes the path, and so patterns like \*.o match names that end in &quot;.o&quot;, no matter what the path prefix is. Note that the backslash must precede every special character (i.e. ?*[]), or the entire argument must be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;&quot;).<div class="spacer">
</div>
In general, use backslashes or double quotes for paths that have wildcards to make <i>zip</i> do the pattern matching for file paths, and always for paths and strings that have spaces or wildcards for  <b>-i</b>, <b>-x</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-U</b> and anywhere  <i>zip</i> needs to process the wildcards.</div>

VMS interprets standard Unix (or PC) return values as other, scarier-looking things, so  <i>zip</i> instead maps them into VMS-style status codes.  In general,  <i>zip</i> sets VMS Facility = 1955 (0x07A3), Code = 2* Unix_status, and an appropriate Severity (as specified in ziperr.h).  More details are included in the VMS-specific documentation.  See [.vms]NOTES.TXT and [.vms]vms_msg_gen.c.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS</h1> <i>zip</i> 3.0 is not compatible with PKUNZIP 1.10. Use <i>zip</i> 1.1 to produce <i>zip</i> files which can be extracted by PKUNZIP 1.10.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>zip</i> files produced by <i>zip</i> 3.0 must not be <i>updated</i> by <i>zip</i> 1.1 or PKZIP 1.10, if they contain encrypted members or if they have been produced in a pipe or on a non-seekable device. The old versions of <i>zip</i> or PKZIP would create an archive with an incorrect format. The old versions can list the contents of the zip file but cannot extract it anyway (because of the new compression algorithm). If you do not use encryption and use regular disk files, you do not have to care about this problem.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Under VMS, not all of the odd file formats are treated properly. Only stream-LF format <i>zip</i> files are expected to work with <i>zip</i>. Others can be converted using Rahul Dhesi's BILF program. This version of <i>zip</i> handles some of the conversion internally. When using Kermit to transfer zip files from VMS to MSDOS, type &quot;set file type block&quot; on VMS.  When transferring from MSDOS to VMS, type &quot;set file type fixed&quot; on VMS.  In both cases, type &quot;set file type binary&quot; on MSDOS.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Under some older VMS versions, <i>zip</i> may hang for file specifications that use DECnet syntax <i>foo::*.*.</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
On OS/2, zip cannot match some names, such as those including an exclamation mark or a hash sign.  This is a bug in OS/2 itself: the 32-bit DosFindFirst/Next don't find such names.  Other programs such as GNU tar are also affected by this bug.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Under OS/2, the amount of Extended Attributes displayed by DIR is (for compatibility) the amount returned by the 16-bit version of DosQueryPathInfo(). Otherwise OS/2 1.3 and 2.0 would report different EA sizes when DIRing a file. However, the structure layout returned by the 32-bit DosQueryPathInfo() is a bit different, it uses extra padding bytes and link pointers (it's a linked list) to have all fields on 4-byte boundaries for portability to future RISC OS/2 versions. Therefore the value reported by <i>zip</i> (which uses this 32-bit-mode size) differs from that reported by DIR. <i>zip</i> stores the 32-bit format for portability, even the 16-bit MS-C-compiled version running on OS/2 1.3, so even this one shows the 32-bit-mode size.</div>

<h1>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h1> Thanks to R. P. Byrne for his <i>Shrink.Pas</i> program, which inspired this project, and from which the shrink algorithm was stolen; to Phil Katz for placing in the public domain the <i>zip</i> file format, compression format, and .ZIP filename extension, and for accepting minor changes to the file format; to Steve Burg for clarifications on the deflate format; to Haruhiko Okumura and Leonid Broukhis for providing some useful ideas for the compression algorithm; to Keith Petersen, Rich Wales, Hunter Goatley and Mark Adler for providing a mailing list and <i>ftp</i> site for the Info-ZIP group to use; and most importantly, to the Info-ZIP group itself (listed in the file <i>infozip.who</i>) without whose tireless testing and bug-fixing efforts a portable <i>zip</i> would not have been possible. Finally we should thank (blame) the first Info-ZIP moderator, David Kirschbaum, for getting us into this mess in the first place. The manual page was rewritten for Unix by R. P. C. Rodgers and updated by E. Gordon for  <i>zip</i> 3.0.</div>
