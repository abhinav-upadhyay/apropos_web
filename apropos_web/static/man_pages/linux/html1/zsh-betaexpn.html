</div>
The following sections explain the types of expansion in detail.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>HISTORY EXPANSION</h1> History expansion allows you to use words from previous command lines in the command line you are typing.  This simplifies spelling corrections and the repetition of complicated commands or arguments. Immediately before execution, each command is saved in the history list, the size of which is controlled by the  <b>HISTSIZE</b> parameter.  The one most recent command is always retained in any case.  Each saved command in the history list is called a history  <i>event</i> and is assigned a number, beginning with 1 (one) when the shell starts up.  The history number that you may see in your prompt (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in  <i>zsh-betamisc</i>(1)) is the number that is to be assigned to the <i>next</i> command.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Overview</h2> A history expansion begins with the first character of the  <b>histchars</b> parameter, which is ` <b>!</b>' by default, and may occur anywhere on the command line; history expansions do not nest.  The ` <b>!</b>' can be escaped with ` <b>\</b>' or can be enclosed between a pair of single quotes (<b>''</b>) to suppress its special meaning.  Double quotes will  <i>not</i> work for this.  Following this history character is an optional event designator (see the section `Event Designators') and then an optional word designator (the section `Word Designators'); if neither of these designators is present, no history expansion occurs.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Input lines containing history expansions are echoed after being expanded, but before any other expansions take place and before the command is executed.  It is this expanded form that is recorded as the history event for later references.<div class="spacer">
</div>
By default, a history reference with no event designator refers to the same event as any preceding history reference on that command line; if it is the only history reference in a command, it refers to the previous command. However, if the option  <b>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</b> is set, then every history reference with no event specification  <i>always</i> refers to the previous command.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, `<b>!</b>' is the event designator for the previous command, so ` <b>!!:1</b>' always refers to the first word of the previous command, and ` <b>!!$</b>' always refers to the last word of the previous command.  With  <b>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</b> set, then `<b>!:1</b>' and `<b>!$</b>' function in the same manner as ` <b>!!:1</b>' and `<b>!!$</b>', respectively.  Conversely, if  <b>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</b> is unset, then `<b>!:1</b>' and `<b>!$</b>' refer to the first and last words, respectively, of the same event referenced by the nearest other history reference preceding them on the current command line, or to the previous command if there is no preceding reference.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The character sequence `<b>^</b><i>foo</i><b>^</b><i>bar</i>' (where `<b>^</b>' is actually the second character of the  <b>histchars</b> parameter) repeats the last command, replacing the string  <i>foo</i> with <i>bar</i>. More precisely, the sequence ` <b>^</b><i>foo</i><b>^</b><i>bar</i><b>^</b>' is synonymous with ` <b>!!:s</b><b>^</b><i>foo</i><b>^</b><i>bar</i><b>^</b>', hence other modifiers (see the section `Modifiers') may follow the final ` <b>^</b>'. In particular, ` <b>^</b><i>foo</i><b>^</b><i>bar</i><b>^:G</b>' performs a global substitution.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the shell encounters the character sequence `<b>!&quot;</b>' in the input, the history mechanism is temporarily disabled until the current list (see  <i>zsh-betamisc</i>(1)) is fully parsed.  The `<b>!&quot;</b>' is removed from the input, and any subsequent ` <b>!</b>' characters have no special significance.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A less convenient but more comprehensible form of command history support is provided by the  <b>fc</b> builtin.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Event Designators</h2> An event designator is a reference to a command-line entry in the history list.  In the list below, remember that the initial  <b>`!'</b> in each item may be changed to another character by setting the  <b>histchars</b> parameter.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>!</b> Start a history expansion, except when followed by a blank, newline, ` <b>=</b>' or `<b>(</b>'.  If followed immediately by a word designator (see the section `Word Designators'), this forms a history reference with no event designator (see the section `Overview').</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>!!</b></dt>
<dd>
Refer to the previous command. By itself, this expansion repeats the previous command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>!</b><i>n</i></dt>
<dd>
Refer to command-line <i>n</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>!-</b><i>n</i></dt>
<dd>
Refer to the current command-line minus <i>n</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>!</b><i>str</i></dt>
<dd>
Refer to the most recent command starting with <i>str</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>!?</b><i>str</i>[<b>?</b>]</dt>
<dd>
Refer to the most recent command containing <i>str</i>.  The trailing ` <b>?</b>' is necessary if this reference is to be followed by a modifier or followed by any text that is not to be considered part of  <i>str</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>!#</b></dt>
<dd>
Refer to the current command line typed in so far.  The line is treated as if it were complete up to and including the word before the one with the ` <b>!#</b>' reference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>!{</b>...<b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
Insulate a history reference from adjacent characters (if necessary).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Word Designators</h2> A word designator indicates which word or words of a given command line are to be included in a history reference.  A ` <b>:</b>' usually separates the event specification from the word designator. It may be omitted only if the word designator begins with a ` <b>^</b>', `<b>$</b>', `<b>*</b>', `<b>-</b>' or `<b>%</b>'. Word designators include:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>0</b></dt>
<dd>
The first input word (command).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>n</i></dt>
<dd>
The <i>n</i>th argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>^</b></dt>
<dd>
The first argument.  That is, <b>1</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>$</b></dt>
<dd>
The last argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>%</b></dt>
<dd>
The word matched by (the most recent) <b>?</b><i>str</i> search.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>x</i><b>-</b><i>y</i></dt>
<dd>
A range of words; <i>x</i> defaults to <b>0</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>*</b></dt>
<dd>
All the arguments, or a null value if there are none.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>x</i><b>*</b></dt>
<dd>
Abbreviates `<i>x</i><b>-$</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>x</i><b>-</b></dt>
<dd>
Like `<i>x</i><b>*</b>' but omitting word <b>$</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that a `<b>%</b>' word designator works only when used in one of ` <b>!%</b>', `<b>!:%</b>' or `<b>!?</b><i>str</i><b>?:%</b>', and only when used after a  <b>!?</b> expansion (possibly in an earlier command).  Anything else results in an error, although the error may not be the most obvious one.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Modifiers</h2> After the optional word designator, you can add a sequence of one or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a ` <b>:</b>'.  These modifiers also work on the result of  <i>filename generation</i> and <i>parameter expansion</i>, except where noted.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>a</b> Turn a file name into an absolute path:  prepends the current directory, if necessary, and resolves any use of ` <b>..</b>' and `<b>.</b>' in the path. Note that the transformation takes place even if the file or any intervening directories do not exist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>A</b></dt>
<dd>
As `<b>a</b>', but also resolve use of symbolic links where possible. Note that resolution of ` <b>..</b>' occurs <i>before</i> resolution of symbolic links.  This call is equivalent to  <b>a</b> unless your system has the  <b>realpath</b> system call (modern systems do).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>c</b></dt>
<dd>
Resolve a command name into an absolute path by searching the command path given by the  <b>PATH</b> variable.  This does not work for commands containing directory parts.  Note also that this does not usually work as a glob qualifier unless a file of the same name is found in the current directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>e</b></dt>
<dd>
Remove all but the part of the filename extension following the `<b>.</b>'; see the definition of the filename extension in the description of the  <b>r</b> modifier below.  Note that according to that definition the result will be empty if the string ends with a ` <b>.</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>h</b></dt>
<dd>
Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the head.  This works like ` <b>dirname</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>l</b></dt>
<dd>
Convert the words to all lowercase.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>p</b></dt>
<dd>
Print the new command but do not execute it.  Only works with history expansion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>q</b></dt>
<dd>
Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.  Works with history expansion and parameter expansion, though for parameters it is only useful if the resulting text is to be re-evaluated such as by  <b>eval</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Q</b></dt>
<dd>
Remove one level of quotes from the substituted words.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>r</b></dt>
<dd>
Remove a filename extension leaving the root name.  Strings with no filename extension are not altered.  A filename extension is a ` <b>.</b>' followed by any number of characters (including zero) that are neither ` <b>.</b>' nor `<b>/</b>' and that continue to the end of the string.  For example, the extension of ` <b>foo.orig.c</b>' is `<b>.c</b>', and `<b>dir.c/foo</b>' has no extension.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>s/</b><i>l</i><b>/</b><i>r</i>[<b>/</b>]</dt>
<dd>
Substitute <i>r</i> for <i>l</i> as described below. The substitution is done only for the first string that matches  <i>l</i>.  For arrays and for filename generation, this applies to each word of the expanded text.  See below for further notes on substitutions.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The forms `<b>gs/</b><i>l</i><b>/</b><i>r</i>' and `<b>s/</b><i>l</i><b>/</b><i>r</i><b>/:G</b>' perform global substitution, i.e. substitute every occurrence of  <i>r</i> for  <i>l</i>.  Note that the <b>g</b> or <b>:G</b> must appear in exactly the position shown.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See further notes on this form of substitution below.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&amp;</b></dt>
<dd>
Repeat the previous <b>s</b> substitution.  Like <b>s</b>, may be preceded immediately by a  <b>g</b>.  In parameter expansion the <b>&amp;</b> must appear inside braces, and in filename generation it must be quoted with a backslash.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>t</b></dt>
<dd>
Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.  This works like ` <b>basename</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>u</b></dt>
<dd>
Convert the words to all uppercase.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>x</b></dt>
<dd>
Like <b>q</b>, but break into words at whitespace.  Does not work with parameter expansion.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>s/</b><i>l</i><b>/</b><i>r</i><b>/</b> substitution works as follows.  By default the left-hand side of substitutions are not patterns, but character strings.  Any character can be used as the delimiter in place of ` <b>/</b>'.  A backslash quotes the delimiter character.  The character ` <b>&amp;</b>', in the right-hand-side <i>r</i>, is replaced by the text from the left-hand-side  <i>l</i>.  The `<b>&amp;</b>' can be quoted with a backslash.  A null  <i>l</i> uses the previous string either from the previous <i>l</i> or from the contextual scan string  <i>s</i> from `<b>!?</b><i>s</i>'.  You can omit the rightmost delimiter if a newline immediately follows  <i>r</i>; the rightmost ` <b>?</b>' in a context scan can similarly be omitted.  Note the same record of the last  <i>l</i> and <i>r</i> is maintained across all forms of expansion.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that if a `<b>&amp;</b>' is used within glob qualifers an extra backslash is needed as a  <b>&amp;</b> is a special character in this case.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the option <b>HIST_SUBST_PATTERN</b> is set, <i>l</i> is treated as a pattern of the usual form described in the section FILENAME GENERATION below.  This can be used in all the places where modifiers are available; note, however, that in globbing qualifiers parameter substitution has already taken place, so parameters in the replacement string should be quoted to ensure they are replaced at the correct time. Note also that complicated patterns used in globbing qualifiers may need the extended glob qualifier notation  <b>(#q:s/</b><i>...</i><b>/</b><i>...</i><b>/)</b> in order for the shell to recognize the expression as a glob qualifier.  Further, note that bad patterns in the substitution are not subject to the  <b>NO_BAD_PATTERN</b> option so will cause an error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <b>HIST_SUBST_PATTERN</b> is set, <i>l</i> may start with a <b>#</b> to indicate that the pattern must match at the start of the string to be substituted, and a  <b>%</b> may appear at the start or after an <b>#</b> to indicate that the pattern must match at the end of the string to be substituted.  The  <b>%</b> or <b>#</b> may be quoted with two backslashes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, the following piece of filename generation code with the  <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> option:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>print *.c(#q:s/#%(#b)s(*).c/'S${match[1]}.C'/)</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
takes the expansion of <b>*.c</b> and applies the glob qualifiers in the  <b>(#q</b><i>...</i><b>)</b> expression, which consists of a substitution modifier anchored to the start and end of each word ( <b>#%</b>).  This turns on backreferences ( <b>(#b)</b>), so that the parenthesised subexpression is available in the replacement string as  <b>${match[1]}</b>. The replacement string is quoted so that the parameter is not substituted before the start of filename generation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>w</b> and <b>W</b> modifiers work only with parameter expansion and filename generation.  They are listed here to provide a single point of reference for all modifiers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>f</b> Repeats the immediately (without a colon) following modifier until the resulting word doesn't change any more.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>F:</b><i>expr</i><b>:</b></dt>
<dd>
Like <b>f</b>, but repeats only <i>n</i> times if the expression  <i>expr</i> evaluates to <i>n</i>.  Any character can be used instead of the ` <b>:</b>'; if `<b>(</b>', `<b>[</b>', or `<b>{</b>' is used as the opening delimiter, the closing delimiter should be ' <b>)</b>', `<b>]</b>', or `<b>}</b>', respectively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>w</b></dt>
<dd>
Makes the immediately following modifier work on each word in the string.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>W:</b><i>sep</i><b>:</b></dt>
<dd>
Like <b>w</b> but words are considered to be the parts of the string that are separated by  <i>sep</i>. Any character can be used instead of the ` <b>:</b>'; opening parentheses are handled specially, see above.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>PROCESS SUBSTITUTION</h1> Each part of a command argument that takes the form ` <b>&lt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b>', ` <b>&gt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b>' or ` <b>=(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b>' is subject to process substitution.  The expression may be preceded or followed by other strings except that, to prevent clashes with commonly occurring strings and patterns, the last form must occur at the start of a command argument, and the forms are only expanded when first parsing command or assignment arguments. Process substitutions may be used following redirection operators; in this case, the substitution must appear with no trailing string.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the case of the <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> forms, the shell runs the commands in  <i>list</i> as a subprocess of the job executing the shell command line. If the system supports the  <b>/dev/fd</b> mechanism, the command argument is the name of the device file corresponding to a file descriptor; otherwise, if the system supports named pipes (FIFOs), the command argument will be a named pipe.  If the form with  <b>&gt;</b> is selected then writing on this special file will provide input for  <i>list</i>.  If <b>&lt;</b> is used, then the file passed as an argument will be connected to the output of the  <i>list</i> process.  For example,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><b>paste &lt;(cut -f1</b><b> </b><i>file1</i><b></b><b>) &lt;(cut -f3</b><b> </b><i>file2</i><b></b><b>) |</b><br/>
<b>tee &gt;(</b><b></b><i>process1</i><b></b><b>) &gt;(</b><b></b><i>process2</i><b></b><b>) &gt;/dev/null</b><b></b><b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
cuts fields 1 and 3 from the files <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> respectively, pastes the results together, and sends it to the processes  <i>process1</i> and <i>process2</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <b>=(</b><i>...</i><b>)</b> is used instead of  <b>&lt;(</b><i>...</i><b>)</b>, then the file passed as an argument will be the name of a temporary file containing the output of the  <i>list</i> process.  This may be used instead of the  <b>&lt;</b> form for a program that expects to lseek (see  <i>lseek</i>(2)) on the input file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is an optimisation for substitutions of the form  <b>=(&lt;&lt;&lt;</b><i>arg</i><b>)</b>, where <i>arg</i> is a single-word argument to the here-string redirection  <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b>.  This form produces a file name containing the value of  <i>arg</i> after any substitutions have been performed.  This is handled entirely within the current shell.  This is effectively the reverse of the special form  <b>$(&lt;</b><i>arg</i><b>)</b> which treats  <i>arg</i> as a file name and replaces it with the file's contents.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>=</b> form is useful as both the <b>/dev/fd</b> and the named pipe implementation of  <b>&lt;(</b><i>...</i><b>)</b> have drawbacks.  In the former case, some programmes may automatically close the file descriptor in question before examining the file on the command line, particularly if this is necessary for security reasons such as when the programme is running setuid.  In the second case, if the programme does not actually open the file, the subshell attempting to read from or write to the pipe will (in a typical implementation, different operating systems may have different behaviour) block for ever and have to be killed explicitly.  In both cases, the shell actually supplies the information using a pipe, so that programmes that expect to lseek (see  <i>lseek</i>(2)) on the file will not work.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Also note that the previous example can be more compactly and efficiently written (provided the  <b>MULTIOS</b> option is set) as:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><b>paste &lt;(cut -f1</b><b> </b><i>file1</i><b></b><b>) &lt;(cut -f3</b><b> </b><i>file2</i><b></b><b>)</b><b> \ </b><br/>
<b></b><b>&gt; &gt;(</b><b></b><i>process1</i><b></b><b>) &gt; &gt;(</b><b></b><i>process2</i><b></b><b>)</b><b></b><b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The shell uses pipes instead of FIFOs to implement the latter two process substitutions in the above example.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is an additional problem with <b>&gt;(</b><i>process</i><b>)</b>; when this is attached to an external command, the parent shell does not wait for  <i>process</i> to finish and hence an immediately following command cannot rely on the results being complete.  The problem and solution are the same as described in the section  <i>MULTIOS</i> in  <i>zsh-betamisc</i>(1).  Hence in a simplified version of the example above:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><b>paste &lt;(cut -f1</b><b> </b><i>file1</i><b></b><b>) &lt;(cut -f3</b><b> </b><i>file2</i><b></b><b>)</b><b> </b><b>&gt; &gt;(</b><b></b><i>process</i><b></b><b>)</b><b></b><b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(note that no <b>MULTIOS</b> are involved), <i>process</i> will be run asynchronously as far as the parent shell is concerned.  The workaround is:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><b>{ paste &lt;(cut -f1</b><b> </b><i>file1</i><b></b><b>) &lt;(cut -f3</b><b> </b><i>file2</i><b></b><b>) }</b><b> </b><b>&gt; &gt;(</b><b></b><i>process</i><b></b><b>)</b><b></b><b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The extra processes here are spawned from the parent shell which will wait for their completion.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Another problem arises any time a job with a substitution that requires a temporary file is disowned by the shell, including the case where ` <b>&amp;!</b>' or `<b>&amp;|</b>' appears at the end of a command containing a subsitution.  In that case the temporary file will not be cleaned up as the shell no longer has any memory of the job.  A workaround is to use a subshell, for example,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>(mycmd =(myoutput)) &amp;!</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
as the forked subshell will wait for the command to finish then remove the temporary file.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>PARAMETER EXPANSION</h1> The character ` <b>$</b>' is used to introduce parameter expansions. See  <i>zsh-betaparam</i>(1) for a description of parameters, including arrays, associative arrays, and subscript notation to access individual array elements.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note in particular the fact that words of unquoted parameters are not automatically split on whitespace unless the option  <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> is set; see references to this option below for more details.  This is an important difference from other shells.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the expansions discussed below that require a pattern, the form of the pattern is the same as that used for filename generation; see the section `Filename Generation'.  Note that these patterns, along with the replacement text of any substitutions, are themselves subject to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. In addition to the following operations, the colon modifiers described in the section `Modifiers' in the section `History Expansion' can be applied:  for example,  <b>${i:s/foo/bar/}</b> performs string substitution on the expansion of parameter  <b>$i</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>}</b> The value, if any, of the parameter  <i>name</i> is substituted. The braces are required if the expansion is to be followed by a letter, digit, or underscore that is not to be interpreted as part of  <i>name</i>.  In addition, more complicated forms of substitution usually require the braces to be present; exceptions, which only apply if the option  <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is not set, are a single subscript or any colon modifiers appearing after the name, or any of the characters ` <b>^</b>', ` <b>=</b>', `<b>~</b>', `<b>#</b>' or `<b>+</b>' appearing before the name, all of which work with or without braces.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>name</i> is an array parameter, and the <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is not set, then the value of each element of  <i>name</i> is substituted, one element per word.  Otherwise, the expansion results in one word only; with  <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b>, this is the first element of an array.  No field splitting is done on the result unless the  <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> option is set. See also the flags  <b>=</b> and <b>s:</b><i>string</i><b>:</b>.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${+</b><i>name</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
If <i>name</i> is the name of a set parameter `<b>1</b>' is substituted, otherwise ` <b>0</b>' is substituted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>

<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>:</b><i>offset</i><b>:</b><i>length</i><b>}</b> This syntax gives effects similar to parameter subscripting in the form  <b>$</b><i>name</i><b>[</b><i>start</i><b>,</b><i>end</i><b>]</b>, but is compatible with other shells; note that both  <i>offset</i> and <i>length</i> are interpreted differently from the components of a subscript.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>offset</i> is non-negative, then if the variable <i>name</i> is a scalar substitute the contents starting  <i>offset</i> characters from the first character of the string, and if  <i>name</i> is an array substitute elements starting  <i>offset</i> elements from the first element.  If  <i>length</i> is given, substitute that many characters or elements, otherwise the entire rest of the scalar or array.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A positive <i>offset</i> is always treated as the offset of a character or element in  <i>name</i> from the first character or element of the array (this is different from native zsh subscript notation).  Hence 0 refers to the first character or element regardless of the setting of the option  <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A negative offset counts backwards from the end of the scalar or array, so that -1 corresponds to the last character or element, and so on.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When positive, <i>length</i> counts from the <i>offset</i> position toward the end of the scalar or array.  When negative,  <i>length</i> counts back from the end.  If this results in a position smaller than  <i>offset</i>, a diagnostic is printed and nothing is substituted.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The option <b>MULTIBYTE</b> is obeyed, i.e. the offset and length count multibyte characters where appropriate.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>offset</i> and <i>length</i> undergo the same set of shell substitutions as for scalar assignment; in addition, they are then subject to arithmetic evaluation.  Hence, for example<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>print ${foo:3}</b><br/>
<b>print ${foo: 1 + 2}</b><br/>
<b>print ${foo:$(( 1 + 2))}</b><br/>
<b>print ${foo:$(echo 1 + 2)}</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
all have the same effect, extracting the string starting at the fourth character of  <b>$foo</b> if the substution would otherwise return a scalar, or the array starting at the fourth element if  <b>$foo</b> would return an array.  Note that with the option  <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> <b>$foo</b> always returns a scalar (regardless of the use of the offset syntax) and a form such as  <b>$foo[*]:3</b> is required to extract elements of an array named  <b>foo</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>offset</i> is negative, the <b>-</b> may not appear immediately after the  <b>:</b> as this indicates the  <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>:-</b><i>word</i><b>}</b> form of substitution.  Instead, a space may be inserted before the  <b>-</b>.  Furthermore, neither <i>offset</i> nor  <i>length</i> may begin with an alphabetic character or <b>&amp;</b> as these are used to indicate history-style modifiers.  To substitute a value from a variable, the recommended approach is to precede it with a  <b>$</b> as this signifies the intention (parameter substitution can easily be rendered unreadable); however, as arithmetic substitution is performed, the expression  <b>${var: offs}</b> does work, retrieving the offset from  <b>$offs</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For further compatibility with other shells there is a special case for array offset 0.  This usually accesses to the first element of the array.  However, if the substitution refers the positional parameter array, e.g.  <b>$@</b> or <b>$*</b>, then offset 0 instead refers to  <b>$0</b>, offset 1 refers to <b>$1</b>, and so on.  In other words, the positional parameter array is effectively extended by prepending  <b>$0</b>.  Hence <b>${*:0:1}</b> substitutes <b>$0</b> and  <b>${*:1:1}</b> substitutes <b>$1</b>.</div>

<dd>
<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>//</b><i>pattern</i><b>/</b><i>repl</i><b>}</b> Replace the longest possible match of  <i>pattern</i> in the expansion of parameter  <i>name</i> by string <i>repl</i>.  The first form replaces just the first occurrence, the second form all occurrences. Both  <i>pattern</i> and <i>repl</i> are subject to double-quoted substitution, so that expressions like  <b>${name/$opat/$npat}</b> will work, but note the usual rule that pattern characters in  <b>$opat</b> are not treated specially unless either the option  <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> is set, or <b>$opat</b> is instead substituted as  <b>${~opat}</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>pattern</i> may begin with a `<b>#</b>', in which case the  <i>pattern</i> must match at the start of the string, or `<b>%</b>', in which case it must match at the end of the string, or ` <b>#%</b>' in which case the  <i>pattern</i> must match the entire string.  The <i>repl</i> may be an empty string, in which case the final ` <b>/</b>' may also be omitted. To quote the final ` <b>/</b>' in other cases it should be preceded by a single backslash; this is not necessary if the ` <b>/</b>' occurs inside a substituted parameter.  Note also that the `<b>#</b>', ` <b>%</b>' and `<b>#%</b> are not active if they occur inside a substituted parameter, even at the start.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first `<b>/</b>' may be preceded by a `<b>:</b>', in which case the match will only succeed if it matches the entire word.  Note also the effect of the  <b>I</b> and <b>S</b> parameter expansion flags below; however, the flags  <b>M</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b> and <b>N</b> are not useful.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>foo=&quot;twinkle twinkle little star&quot; sub=&quot;t*e&quot; rep=&quot;spy&quot;</b><br/>
<b>print ${foo//${~sub}/$rep}</b><br/>
<b>print ${(S)foo//${~sub}/$rep}</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here, the `<b>~</b>' ensures that the text of <b>$sub</b> is treated as a pattern rather than a plain string.  In the first case, the longest match for  <b>t*e</b> is substituted and the result is `<b>spy star</b>', while in the second case, the shortest matches are taken and the result is ` <b>spy spy lispy star</b>'.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${#</b><i>spec</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
If <i>spec</i> is one of the above substitutions, substitute the length in characters of the result instead of the result itself.  If  <i>spec</i> is an array expression, substitute the number of elements of the result. Note that ` <b>^</b>', `<b>=</b>', and `<b>~</b>', below, must appear to the left of ` <b>#</b>' when these forms are combined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${^</b><i>spec</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
Turn on the <b>RC_EXPAND_PARAM</b> option for the evaluation of  <i>spec</i>; if the `<b>^</b>' is doubled, turn it off. When this option is set, array expansions of the form  <i>foo</i><b>${</b><i>xx</i><b>}</b><i>bar</i>, where the parameter  <i>xx</i> is set to  <b>(</b><i>a b c</i><b>)</b>, are substituted with ` <i>fooabar foobbar foocbar</i>' instead of the default ` <i>fooa b cbar</i>'.  Note that an empty array will therefore cause all arguments to be removed.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Internally, each such expansion is converted into the equivalent list for brace expansion.  E.g.,  <b>${^var}</b> becomes  <b>{$var[1],$var[2],</b>...<b>}</b>, and is processed as described in the section `Brace Expansion' below. If word splitting is also in effect the  <b>$var[</b><i>N</i><b>]</b> may themselves be split into different list elements.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${=</b><i>spec</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
Perform word splitting using the rules for <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> during the evaluation of  <i>spec</i>, but regardless of whether the parameter appears in double quotes; if the ` <b>=</b>' is doubled, turn it off. This forces parameter expansions to be split into separate words before substitution, using  <b>IFS</b> as a delimiter. This is done by default in most other shells.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that splitting is applied to <i>word</i> in the assignment forms of  <i>spec</i> <i>before</i> the assignment to <i>name</i> is performed. This affects the result of array assignments with the  <b>A</b> flag.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${~</b><i>spec</i><b>}</b></dt>
<dd>
Turn on the <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> option for the evaluation of  <i>spec</i>; if the `<b>~</b>' is doubled, turn it off.  When this option is set, the string resulting from the expansion will be interpreted as a pattern anywhere that is possible, such as in filename expansion and filename generation and pattern-matching contexts like the right hand side of the ` <b>=</b>' and `<b>!=</b>' operators in conditions.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In nested substitutions, note that the effect of the <b>~</b> applies to the result of the current level of substitution.  A surrounding pattern operation on the result may cancel it.  Hence, for example, if the parameter  <b>foo</b> is set to <b>*</b>, <b>${~foo//\*/*.c}</b> is substituted by the pattern  <b>*.c</b>, which may be expanded by filename generation, but  <b>${${~foo}//\*/*.c}</b> substitutes to the string <b>*.c</b>, which will not be further expanded.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a <b>${</b>...<b>}</b> type parameter expression or a  <b>$(</b>...<b>)</b> type command substitution is used in place of  <i>name</i> above, it is expanded first and the result is used as if it were the value of  <i>name</i>.  Thus it is possible to perform nested operations:   <b>${${foo#head}%tail}</b> substitutes the value of  <b>$foo</b> with both `<b>head</b>' and `<b>tail</b>' deleted.  The form with  <b>$(</b>...<b>)</b> is often useful in combination with the flags described next; see the examples below. Each  <i>name</i> or nested <b>${</b>...<b>}</b> in a parameter expansion may also be followed by a subscript expression as described in  <i>Array Parameters</i> in <i>zsh-betaparam</i>(1).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that double quotes may appear around nested expressions, in which case only the part inside is treated as quoted; for example,  <b>${(f)&quot;$(foo)&quot;}</b> quotes the result of <b>$(foo)</b>, but the flag `<b>(f)</b>' (see below) is applied using the rules for unquoted expansions.  Note further that quotes are themselves nested in this context; for example, in  <b>&quot;${(@f)&quot;$(foo)&quot;}&quot;</b>, there are two sets of quotes, one surrounding the whole expression, the other (redundant) surrounding the  <b>$(foo)</b> as before.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Parameter Expansion Flags</h2> If the opening brace is directly followed by an opening parenthesis, the string up to the matching closing parenthesis will be taken as a list of flags.  In cases where repeating a flag is meaningful, the repetitions need not be consecutive; for example, `( <b>q%q%q</b>)' means the same thing as the more readable `( <b>%%qqq</b>)'.  The following flags are supported:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>#</b> Evaluate the resulting words as numeric expressions and output the characters corresponding to the resulting integer.  Note that this form is entirely distinct from use of the  <b>#</b> without parentheses.</dd>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <b>MULTIBYTE</b> option is set and the number is greater than 127 (i.e. not an ASCII character) it is treated as a Unicode character.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>%</b></dt>
<dd>
Expand all <b>%</b> escapes in the resulting words in the same way as in prompts (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in  <i>zsh-betamisc</i>(1)). If this flag is given twice, full prompt expansion is done on the resulting words, depending on the setting of the  <b>PROMPT_PERCENT</b>, <b>PROMPT_SUBST</b> and <b>PROMPT_BANG</b> options.</dd>

<dt>
<b>@</b></dt>
<dd>
In double quotes, array elements are put into separate words. E.g., ` <b>&quot;${(@)foo}&quot;</b>' is equivalent to `<b>&quot;${foo[@]}&quot;</b>' and ` <b>&quot;${(@)foo[1,2]}&quot;</b>' is the same as `<b>&quot;$foo[1]&quot; &quot;$foo[2]&quot;</b>'. This is distinct from  <i>field splitting</i> by the <b>f</b>, <b>s</b> or  <b>z</b> flags, which still applies within each array element.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>A</b></dt>
<dd>
Create an array parameter with `<b>${</b>...<b>=</b>...<b>}</b>', ` <b>${</b>...<b>:=</b>...<b>}</b>' or `<b>${</b>...<b>::=</b>...<b>}</b>'. If this flag is repeated (as in ` <b>AA</b>'), create an associative array parameter.  Assignment is made before sorting or padding. The  <i>name</i> part may be a subscripted range for ordinary arrays; the  <i>word</i> part <i>must</i> be converted to an array, for example by using ` <b>${(AA)=</b><i>name</i><b>=</b>...<b>}</b>' to activate field splitting, when creating an associative array.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>a</b></dt>
<dd>
Sort in array index order; when combined with `<b>O</b>' sort in reverse array index order.  Note that ` <b>a</b>' is therefore equivalent to the default but ` <b>Oa</b>' is useful for obtaining an array's elements in reverse order.</dd>

<b>D</b></dt>
<dd>
Assume the string or array elements contain directories and attempt to substitute the leading part of these by names.  The remainder of the path (the whole of it if the leading part was not subsituted) is then quoted so that the whole string can be used as a shell argument.  This is the reverse of ` <b>~</b>' substitution:  see the section FILENAME EXPANSION below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>e</b></dt>

Process escape sequences like the echo builtin when no options are given ( <b>g::</b>).  With the <b>o</b> option, octal escapes don't take a leading zero.  With the  <b>c</b> option, sequences like `<b>^X</b>' are also processed. With the  <b>e</b> option, processes `<b>\M-t</b>' and similar sequences like the print builtin.  With both of the  <b>o</b> and <b>e</b> options, behaves like the print builtin except that in none of these modes is ` <b>\c</b>' interpreted.</dd>

If <i>name</i> refers to an associative array, substitute the <i>keys</i> (element names) rather than the values of the elements.  Used with subscripts (including ordinary arrays), force indices or keys to be substituted even if the subscript form refers to values.  However, this flag may not be combined with subscript ranges.</dd>

Convert all letters in the result to lower case.</dd>

Sort decimal integers numerically; if the first differing characters of two test strings are not digits, sorting is lexical.   Integers with more initial zeroes are sorted before those with fewer or none.  Hence the array ` <b>foo1 foo02</b>  <b>foo2 foo3 foo20 foo23</b>' is sorted into the order shown.

Sort the resulting words in ascending order; if this appears on its own the sorting is lexical and case-sensitive (unless the locale renders it case-insensitive).  Sorting in ascending order is the default for other forms of sorting, so this is ignored if combined with ` <b>a</b>', `<b>i</b>' or `<b>n</b>'.</dd>
</dl>

<b>O</b></dt>
<dd>
Sort the resulting words in descending order; `<b>O</b>' without `<b>a</b>', ` <b>i</b>' or `<b>n</b>' sorts in reverse lexical order.  May be combined with ` <b>a</b>', `<b>i</b>' or `<b>n</b>' to reverse the order of sorting.</dd>

<b>P</b></dt>
<dd>
This forces the value of the parameter <i>name</i> to be interpreted as a further parameter name, whose value will be used where appropriate.

If this flag is given twice, the resulting words are quoted in single quotes and if it is given three times, the words are quoted in double quotes; in these forms no special handling of unprintable or invalid characters is attempted.

If a <b>q-</b> is given (only a single <b>q</b> may appear), a minimal form of single quoting is used that only quotes the string if needed to protect special characters.  Typically this form gives the most readable output.</div>

Note that this is done very late, as for the `<b>(s)</b>' flag. So to access single words in the result, one has to use nested expansions as in ` <b>${${(z)foo}[2]}</b>'. Likewise, to remove the quotes in the resulting words one would do: ` <b>${(Q)${(z)foo}}</b>'.</div>

The following flags (except <b>p</b>) are followed by one or more arguments as shown.  Any character, or the matching pairs ` <b>(</b>...<b>)</b>', ` <b>{</b>...<b>}</b>', `<b>[</b>...<b>]</b>', or `<b>&lt;</b>...<b>&gt;</b>', may be used in place of a colon as delimiters, but note that when a flag takes more than one argument, a matched pair of delimiters must surround each argument.<div class="spacer">

Only useful together with one of the flags <b>l</b> or <b>r</b> or with the  <b>#</b> length operator when the <b>MULTIBYTE</b> option is in effect.  Use the character width reported by the system in calculating how much of the string it occupies or the overall length of the string.  Most printable characters have a width of one unit, however certain Asian character sets and certain special effects use wider characters; combining characters have zero width. Non-printable characters are arbitrarily counted as zero width; how they would actually be displayed will vary.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <b>m</b> is repeated, the character either counts zero (if it has zero width), else one.

Left and right padding may be used together.  In this case the strategy is to apply left padding to the first half width of each of the resulting words, and right padding to the second half.  If the string to be padded has odd width the extra padding is applied on the left.</div>

<b>s:</b><i>string</i><b>:</b></dt>

For historical reasons, the usual behaviour that empty array elements are retained inside double quotes is disabled for arrays generated by splitting; hence the following:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>line=&quot;one::three&quot;</b><br/>
<b>print -l &quot;${(s.:.)line}&quot;</b><br/>

As <b>z</b> but takes a combination of option letters between a following pair of delimiter characters.   <b>(Z+c+)</b> causes comments to be parsed as a string and retained; any field in the resulting array beginning with an unquoted comment character is a comment.   <b>(Z+C+)</b> causes comments to be parsed and removed.  The rule for comments is standard: anything between a word starting with the third character of  <b>$HISTCHARS</b>, default <b>#</b>, up to the next newline is a comment.   <b>(Z+n+)</b> causes unquoted newlines to be treated as ordinary whitespace, else they are treated as if they are shell code delimiters and converted to semicolons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>_:</b><i>flags</i><b>:</b></dt>
<dd>
The underscore (<b>_</b>) flag is reserved for future use.  As of this revision of zsh, there are no valid  <i>flags</i>; anything following an underscore, other than an empty pair of delimiters, is treated as an error, and the flag itself has no effect.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following flags are meaningful with the <b>${</b>...<b>#</b>...<b>}</b> or  <b>${</b>...<b>%</b>...<b>}</b> forms.  The <b>S</b> and <b>I</b> flags may also be used with the  <b>${</b>...<b>/</b>...<b>}</b> forms.<div class="spacer">

The <i>expr</i>th match is counted such that there is either one or zero matches from each starting position in the string, although for global substitution matches overlapping previous replacements are ignored.

<h2>Rules</h2> Here is a summary of the rules for substitution; this assumes that braces are present around the substitution, i.e.  <b>${...}</b>.  Some particular examples are given below.  Note that the Zsh Development Group accepts  <i>no responsibility</i> for any brain damage which may occur during the reading of the following rules.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>1.</b> <i>Nested Substitution</i> If multiple nested  <b>${...}</b> forms are present, substitution is performed from the inside outwards.  At each level, the substitution takes account of whether the current value is a scalar or an array, whether the whole substitution is in double quotes, and what flags are supplied to the current level of substitution, just as if the nested substitution were the outermost.  The flags are not propagated up to enclosing substitutions; the nested substitution will return either a scalar or an array as determined by the flags, possibly adjusted for quoting.  All the following steps take place where applicable at all levels of substitution. Note that, unless the ` <b>(P)</b>' flag is present, the flags and any subscripts apply directly to the value of the nested substitution; for example, the expansion  <b>${${foo}}</b> behaves exactly the same as <b>${foo}</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
At each nested level of substitution, the substituted words undergo all forms of single-word substitution (i.e. not filename generation), including command substitution, arithmetic expansion and filename expansion (i.e. leading  <b>~</b> and <b>=</b>).  Thus, for example, <b>${${:-=cat}:h}</b> expands to the directory where the  <b>cat</b> program resides.  (Explanation: the internal substitution has no parameter but a default value  <b>=cat</b>, which is expanded by filename expansion to a full path; the outer substitution then applies the modifier  <b>:h</b> and takes the directory part of the path.)</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>2.</b> <i>Internal Parameter Flags</i></dt>
<dd>
Any parameter flags set by one of the <b>typeset</b> family of commands, in particular the  <b>L</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>u</b> and <b>l</b> flags for padding and capitalization, are applied directly to the parameter value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>3.</b> <i>Parameter Subscripting</i></dt>
<dd>
If the value is a raw parameter reference with a subscript, such as  <b>${</b><i>var</i><b>[3]}</b>, the effect of subscripting is applied directly to the parameter.  Subscripts are evaluated left to right; subsequent subscripts apply to the scalar or array value yielded by the previous subscript.  Thus if  <b>var</b> is an array, <b>${var[1][2]}</b> is the second character of the first word, but  <b>${var[2,4][2]}</b> is the entire third word (the second word of the range of words two through four of the original array).  Any number of subscripts may appear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>4.</b> <i>Parameter Name Replacement</i></dt>
<dd>
The effect of any <b>(P)</b> flag, which treats the value so far as a parameter name and replaces it with the corresponding value, is applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>5.</b> <i>Double-Quoted Joining</i></dt>
<dd>
If the value after this process is an array, and the substitution appears in double quotes, and no  <b>(@)</b> flag is present at the current level, the words of the value are joined with the first character of the parameter  <b>$IFS</b>, by default a space, between each word (single word arrays are not modified).  If the  <b>(j)</b> flag is present, that is used for joining instead of  <b>$IFS</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>6.</b> <i>Nested Subscripting</i></dt>
<dd>
Any remaining subscripts (i.e. of a nested substitution) are evaluated at this point, based on whether the value is an array or a scalar.  As with  <b>3.</b>, multiple subscripts can appear.  Note that <b>${foo[2,4][2]}</b> is thus equivalent to  <b>${${foo[2,4]}[2]}</b> and also to  <b>&quot;${${(@)foo[2,4]}[2]}&quot;</b> (the nested substitution returns an array in both cases), but not to  <b>&quot;${${foo[2,4]}[2]}&quot;</b> (the nested substitution returns a scalar because of the quotes).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>7.</b> <i>Modifiers</i></dt>
<dd>
Any modifiers, as specified by a trailing `<b>#</b>', `<b>%</b>', `<b>/</b>' (possibly doubled) or by a set of modifiers of the form  <b>:...</b> (see the section `Modifiers' in the section `History Expansion'), are applied to the words of the value at this level.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>8.</b> <i>Character evaluation</i></dt>
<dd>
Any <b>(#)</b> flag is applied, evaluating the result so far numerically as a character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>9.</b> <i>Length</i></dt>
<dd>
Any initial <b>#</b> modifier, i.e. in the form <b>${#</b><i>var</i><b>}</b>, is used to evaluate the length of the expression so far.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>10.</b> <i>Forced Joining</i></dt>
<dd>
If the `<b>(j)</b>' flag is present, or no `<b>(j)</b>' flag is present but the string is to be split as given by rules  <b>16.</b> or <b>17.</b>, and joining did not take place at step  <b>5.</b>, any words in the value are joined together using the given string or the first character of  <b>$IFS</b> if none. Note that the ` <b>(F)</b>' flag implicitly supplies a string for joining in this manner.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>11.</b> <i>Case modification</i></dt>
<dd>
Any case modification from one of the flags <b>(L)</b>, <b>(U)</b> or <b>(C)</b> is applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>12.</b> <i>Escape sequence replacement</i></dt>
<dd>
First any replacements from the <b>(g)</b> flag are performed, then any prompt-style formatting from the  <b>(%)</b> family of flags is applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>13.</b> <i>Quote application</i></dt>
<dd>
Any quoting or unquoting using <b>(q)</b> and <b>(Q)</b> and related flags is applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>14.</b> <i>Directory naming</i></dt>
<dd>
Any directory name substitution using <b>(D)</b> flag is applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>15.</b> <i>Visibility enhancment</i></dt>
<dd>
Any modifications to make characters visible using the <b>(V)</b> flag are applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>16.</b> <i>Forced Splitting</i></dt>
<dd>
If one of the `<b>(s)</b>', `<b>(f)</b>' or `<b>(z)</b>' flags are present, or the `<b>=</b>' specifier was present (e.g.  <b>${=</b><i>var</i><b>}</b>), the word is split on occurrences of the specified string, or (for  <b>=</b> with neither of the two flags present) any of the characters in  <b>$IFS</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>17.</b> <i>Shell Word Splitting</i></dt>
<dd>
If no `<b>(s)</b>', `<b>(f)</b>' or `<b>=</b>' was given, but the word is not quoted and the option  <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> is set, the word is split on occurrences of any of the characters in  <b>$IFS</b>.  Note this step, too, takes place at all levels of a nested substitution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>18.</b> <i>Uniqueness</i></dt>
<dd>
If the result is an array and the `<b>(u)</b>' flag was present, duplicate elements are removed from the array.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>19.</b> <i>Ordering</i></dt>
<dd>
If the result is still an array and one of the `<b>(o)</b>' or `<b>(O)</b>' flags was present, the array is reordered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>20.</b> <i>Re-Evaluation</i></dt>
<dd>
Any `<b>(e)</b>' flag is applied to the value, forcing it to be re-examined for new parameter substitutions, but also for command and arithmetic substitutions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>21.</b> <i>Padding</i></dt>
<dd>
Any padding of the value by the `<b>(l.</b><i>fill</i><b>.)</b>' or ` <b>(r.</b><i>fill</i><b>.)</b>' flags is applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>22.</b> <i>Semantic Joining</i></dt>
<dd>
In contexts where expansion semantics requires a single word to result, all words are rejoined with the first character of  <b>IFS</b> between.  So in ` <b>${(P</b><b>)${(f</b><b>)lines}}</b>' the value of  <b>${lines}</b> is split at newlines, but then must be joined again before the  <b>P</b> flag can be applied.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a single word is not required, this rule is skipped.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>23.</b> <i>Empty argument removal</i></dt>
<dd>
If the substitution does not appear in double quotes, any resulting zero-length argument, whether from a scalar or an element of an array, is elided from the list of arguments inserted into the command line.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Strictly speaking, the removal happens later as the same happens with other forms of substitution; the point to note here is simply that it occurs after any of the above parameter operations.</div>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Examples</h2> The flag  <b>f</b> is useful to split a double-quoted substitution line by line.  For example,  <b>${(f)&quot;$(&lt;</b><i>file</i><b>)&quot;}</b> substitutes the contents of  <i>file</i> divided so that each line is an element of the resulting array.  Compare this with the effect of  <b>$</b><b>(&lt;</b><i>file</i><b>)</b> alone, which divides the file up by words, or the same inside double quotes, which makes the entire content of the file a single string.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following illustrates the rules for nested parameter expansions. Suppose that  <b>$foo</b> contains the array <b>(bar baz</b><b>)</b>:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>&quot;${(@)${foo}[1]}&quot;</b> This produces the result  <b>b</b>.  First, the inner substitution  <b>&quot;${foo}&quot;</b>, which has no array (<b>@</b>) flag, produces a single word result  <b>&quot;bar baz&quot;</b>.  The outer substitution <b>&quot;${(@)...[1]}&quot;</b> detects that this is a scalar, so that (despite the ` <b>(@)</b>' flag) the subscript picks the first character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&quot;${${(@)foo}[1]}&quot;</b></dt>
<dd>
This produces the result `<b>bar</b>'.  In this case, the inner substitution  <b>&quot;${(@)foo}&quot;</b> produces the array `<b>(bar baz</b><b>)</b>'.  The outer substitution  <b>&quot;${...[1]}&quot;</b> detects that this is an array and picks the first word.  This is similar to the simple case  <b>&quot;${foo[1]}&quot;</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
As an example of the rules for word splitting and joining, suppose <b>$foo</b> contains the array ` <b>(ax1 bx1</b><b>)</b>'.  Then<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>${(s/x/)foo}</b> produces the words ` <b>a</b>', `<b>1 b</b>' and `<b>1</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${(j/x/s/x/)foo}</b></dt>
<dd>
produces `<b>a</b>', `<b>1</b>', `<b>b</b>' and `<b>1</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>${(s/x/)foo%%1*}</b></dt>
<dd>
produces `<b>a</b>' and `<b> b</b>' (note the extra space).  As substitution occurs before either joining or splitting, the operation  first generates the modified array  <b>(ax bx</b><b>)</b>, which is joined to give  <b>&quot;ax bx&quot;</b>, and then split to give `<b>a</b>', `<b> b</b>' and `'.  The final empty string will then be elided, as it is not in double quotes.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>COMMAND SUBSTITUTION</h1> A command enclosed in parentheses preceded by a dollar sign, like ` <b>$(</b>...<b>)</b>', or quoted with grave accents, like ` <b>`</b>...<b>`</b>', is replaced with its standard output, with any trailing newlines deleted. If the substitution is not enclosed in double quotes, the output is broken into words using the  <b>IFS</b> parameter. The substitution ` <b>$(cat</b> <i>foo</i><b>)</b>' may be replaced by the equivalent but faster ` <b>$(&lt;</b><i>foo</i><b>)</b>'. In either case, if the option  <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> is set, the output is eligible for filename generation.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ARITHMETIC EXPANSION</h1> A string of the form ` <b>$[</b><i>exp</i><b>]</b>' or ` <b>$((</b><i>exp</i><b>))</b>' is substituted with the value of the arithmetic expression  <i>exp</i>.  <i>exp</i> is subjected to  <i>parameter expansion</i>, <i>command substitution</i> and  <i>arithmetic expansion</i> before it is evaluated. See the section `Arithmetic Evaluation'.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BRACE EXPANSION</h1> A string of the form ` <i>foo</i><b>{</b><i>xx</i><b>,</b><i>yy</i><b>,</b><i>zz</i><b>}</b><i>bar</i>' is expanded to the individual words ` <i>fooxxbar</i>', `<i>fooyybar</i>' and `<i>foozzbar</i>'. Left-to-right order is preserved.  This construct may be nested.  Commas may be quoted in order to include them literally in a word.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An expression of the form `<b>{</b><i>n1</i><b>..</b><i>n2</i><b>}</b>', where  <i>n1</i> and <i>n2</i> are integers, is expanded to every number between  <i>n1</i> and <i>n2</i> inclusive.  If either number begins with a zero, all the resulting numbers will be padded with leading zeroes to that minimum width, but for negative numbers the  <b>-</b> character is also included in the width.  If the numbers are in decreasing order the resulting sequence will also be in decreasing order.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An expression of the form `<b>{</b><i>n1</i><b>..</b><i>n2</i><b>..</b><i>n3</i><b>}</b>', where  <i>n1</i>, <i>n2</i>, and <i>n3</i> are integers, is expanded as above, but only every  <i>n3</i>th number starting from <i>n1</i> is output.  If  <i>n3</i> is negative the numbers are output in reverse order, this is slightly different from simply swapping  <i>n1</i> and <i>n2</i> in the case that the step  <i>n3</i> doesn't evenly divide the range.  Zero padding can be specified in any of the three numbers, specifying it in the third can be useful to pad for example ` <b>{-99..100..01}</b>' which is not possible to specify by putting a 0 on either of the first two numbers (i.e. pad to two characters).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a brace expression matches none of the above forms, it is left unchanged, unless the option  <b>BRACE_CCL</b> (an abbreviation for `brace character class') is set. In that case, it is expanded to a list of the individual characters between the braces sorted into the order of the characters in the ASCII character set (multibyte characters are not currently handled).  The syntax is similar to a  <b>[</b>...<b>]</b> expression in filename generation: ` <b>-</b>' is treated specially to denote a range of characters, but `<b>^</b>' or ` <b>!</b>' as the first character is treated normally.  For example, ` <b>{abcdef0-9}</b>' expands to 16 words <b>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that brace expansion is not part of filename generation (globbing); an expression such as  <b>*/{foo,bar}</b> is split into two separate words  <b>*/foo</b> and <b>*/bar</b> before filename generation takes place.  In particular, note that this is liable to produce a `no match' error if  <i>either</i> of the two expressions does not match; this is to be contrasted with  <b>*/(foo|bar)</b>, which is treated as a single pattern but otherwise has similar effects.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To combine brace expansion with array expansion, see the  <b>${^</b><i>spec</i><b>}</b> form described in the section Parameter Expansion above.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FILENAME EXPANSION</h1> Each word is checked to see if it begins with an unquoted ` <b>~</b>'. If it does, then the word up to a ` <b>/</b>', or the end of the word if there is no ` <b>/</b>', is checked to see if it can be substituted in one of the ways described here.  If so, then the ` <b>~</b>' and the checked portion are replaced with the appropriate substitute value.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A `<b>~</b>' by itself is replaced by the value of <b>$HOME</b>. A ` <b>~</b>' followed by a `<b>+</b>' or a `<b>-</b>' is replaced by current or previous working directory, respectively.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A `<b>~</b>' followed by a number is replaced by the directory at that position in the directory stack. ` <b>~0</b>' is equivalent to `<b>~+</b>', and ` <b>~1</b>' is the top of the stack. ` <b>~+</b>' followed by a number is replaced by the directory at that position in the directory stack. ` <b>~+0</b>' is equivalent to `<b>~+</b>', and ` <b>~+1</b>' is the top of the stack. ` <b>~-</b>' followed by a number is replaced by the directory that many positions from the bottom of the stack. ` <b>~-0</b>' is the bottom of the stack. The  <b>PUSHD_MINUS</b> option exchanges the effects of ` <b>~+</b>' and `<b>~-</b>' where they are followed by a number.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Dynamic named directories</h2> If the function  <b>zsh_directory_name</b> exists, or the shell variable  <b>zsh_directory_name_functions</b> exists and contains an array of function names, then the functions are used to implement dynamic directory naming.  The functions are tried in order until one returns status zero, so it is important that functions test whether they can handle the case in question and return an appropriate status.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A `<b>~</b>' followed by a string <i>namstr</i> in unquoted square brackets is treated specially as a dynamic directory name.  Note that the first unquoted closing square bracket always terminates  <i>namstr</i>.  The shell function is passed two arguments: the string  <b>n</b> (for name) and  <i>namstr</i>.  It should either set the array <b>reply</b> to a single element which is the directory corresponding to the name and return status zero (executing an assignment as the last statement is usually sufficient), or it should return status non-zero.  In the former case the element of reply is used as the directory; in the latter case the substitution is deemed to have failed.  If all functions fail and the option  <b>NOMATCH</b> is set, an error results.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The functions defined as above are also used to see if a directory can be turned into a name, for example when printing the directory stack or when expanding  <b>%~</b> in prompts.  In this case each function is passed two arguments: the string  <b>d</b> (for directory) and the candidate for dynamic naming.  The function should either return non-zero status, if the directory cannot be named by the function, or it should set the array reply to consist of two elements: the first is the dynamic name for the directory (as would appear within ` <b>~[</b><i>...</i><b>]</b>'), and the second is the prefix length of the directory to be replaced.  For example, if the trial directory is  <b>/home/myname/src/zsh</b> and the dynamic name for  <b>/home/myname/src</b> (which has 16 characters) is <b>s</b>, then the function sets<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>reply=(s 16)</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The directory name so returned is compared with possible static names for parts of the directory path, as described below; it is used if the prefix length matched (16 in the example) is longer than that matched by any static name.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is not a requirement that a function implements both  <b>n</b> and <b>d</b> calls; for example, it might be appropriate for certain dynamic forms of expansion not to be contracted to names.  In that case any call with the first argument  <b>d</b> should cause a non-zero status to be returned.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The completion system calls `<b>zsh_directory_name c</b>' followed by equivalent calls to elements of the array  <b>zsh_directory_name_functions</b>, if it exists, in order to complete dynamic names for directories.  The code for this should be as for any other completion function as described in  <i>zsh-betacompsys</i>(1).<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a working example, here is a function that expands any dynamic names beginning with the string  <b>p:</b> to directories below  <b>/home/pws/perforce</b>.  In this simple case a static name for the directory would be just as effective.<div class="spacer">

<h2>Static named directories</h2> A ` <b>~</b>' followed by anything not already covered consisting of any number of alphanumeric characters or underscore (` <b>_</b>'), hyphen (` <b>-</b>'), or dot (`<b>.</b>') is looked up as a named directory, and replaced by the value of that named directory if found. Named directories are typically home directories for users on the system. They may also be defined if the text after the ` <b>~</b>' is the name of a string shell parameter whose value begins with a ` <b>/</b>'. Note that trailing slashes will be removed from the path to the directory (though the original parameter is not modified).<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is also possible to define directory names using the <b>-d</b> option to the  <b>hash</b> builtin.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In certain circumstances (in prompts, for instance), when the shell prints a path, the path is checked to see if it has a named directory as its prefix.  If so, then the prefix portion is replaced with a ` <b>~</b>' followed by the name of the directory. The shortest way of referring to the directory is used, with ties broken in favour of using a named directory, except when the directory is  <b>/</b> itself.  The parameters <b>$PWD</b> and  <b>$OLDPWD</b> are never abbreviated in this fashion.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>`=' expansion</h2> If a word begins with an unquoted ` <b>=</b>' and the  <b>EQUALS</b> option is set, the remainder of the word is taken as the name of a command.  If a command exists by that name, the word is replaced by the full pathname of the command.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Notes</h2> Filename expansion is performed on the right hand side of a parameter assignment, including those appearing after commands of the  <b>typeset</b> family.  In this case, the right hand side will be treated as a colon-separated list in the manner of the  <b>PATH</b> parameter, so that a ` <b>~</b>' or an `<b>=</b>' following a `<b>:</b>' is eligible for expansion. All such behaviour can be disabled by quoting the ` <b>~</b>', the `<b>=</b>', or the whole expression (but not simply the colon); the  <b>EQUALS</b> option is also respected.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the option <b>MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST</b> is set, any unquoted shell argument in the form ` <i>identifier</i><b>=</b><i>expression</i>' becomes eligible for file expansion as described in the previous paragraph.  Quoting the first ` <b>=</b>' also inhibits this.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FILENAME GENERATION</h1> If a word contains an unquoted instance of one of the characters ` <b>*</b>', `<b>(</b>', `<b>|</b>', `<b>&lt;</b>', `<b>[</b>', or `<b>?</b>', it is regarded as a pattern for filename generation, unless the  <b>GLOB</b> option is unset. If the  <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> option is set, the ` <b>^</b>' and `<b>#</b>' characters also denote a pattern; otherwise they are not treated specially by the shell.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The word is replaced with a list of sorted filenames that match the pattern.  If no matching pattern is found, the shell gives an error message, unless the  <b>NULL_GLOB</b> option is set, in which case the word is deleted; or unless the  <b>NOMATCH</b> option is unset, in which case the word is left unchanged.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In filename generation, the character ` <b>/</b>' must be matched explicitly; also, a ` <b>.</b>' must be matched explicitly at the beginning of a pattern or after a ` <b>/</b>', unless the  <b>GLOB_DOTS</b> option is set. No filename generation pattern matches the files ` <b>.</b>' or `<b>..</b>'.  In other instances of pattern matching, the ` <b>/</b>' and `<b>.</b>' are not treated specially.<div class="subsection">

</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Be careful when using other wildcards adjacent to patterns of this form; for example,  <b>&lt;0-9&gt;*</b> will actually match any number whatsoever at the start of the string, since the ` <b>&lt;0-9&gt;</b>' will match the first digit, and the ` <b>*</b>' will match any others.  This is a trap for the unwary, but is in fact an inevitable consequence of the rule that the longest possible match always succeeds.

<dl>
<dt>
<b>(</b>...<b>)</b></dt>
<dd>
Matches the enclosed pattern.  This is used for grouping. If the  <b>KSH_GLOB</b> option is set, then a ` <b>@</b>', `<b>*</b>', `<b>+</b>', `<b>?</b>' or `<b>!</b>' immediately preceding the ` <b>(</b>' is treated specially, as detailed below. The option  <b>SH_GLOB</b> prevents bare parentheses from being used in this way, though the  <b>KSH_GLOB</b> option is still available.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that grouping cannot extend over multiple directories: it is an error to have a ` <b>/</b>' within a group (this only applies for patterns used in filename generation).  There is one exception:  a group of the form  <b>(</b><i>pat</i><b>/)#</b> appearing as a complete path segment can match a sequence of directories.

<dl>
<dt>
<b>^</b><i>x</i></dt>
<dd>
(Requires <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> to be set.) Matches anything except the pattern  <i>x</i>. This has a higher precedence than ` <b>/</b>', so `<b>^foo/bar</b>' will search directories in ` <b>.</b>' except `<b>./foo</b>' for a file named ` <b>bar</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>x</i><b>~</b><i>y</i></dt>
<dd>
(Requires <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> to be set.) Match anything that matches the pattern  <i>x</i> but does not match <i>y</i>. This has lower precedence than any operator except ` <b>|</b>', so ` <b>*/*~foo/bar</b>' will search for all files in all directories in `<b>.</b>' and then exclude ` <b>foo/bar</b>' if there was such a match. Multiple patterns can be excluded by ` <i>foo</i><b>~</b><i>bar</i><b>~</b><i>baz</i>'. In the exclusion pattern ( <i>y</i>), `<b>/</b>' and `<b>.</b>' are not treated specially the way they usually are in globbing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>x</i><b>#</b></dt>
<dd>
(Requires <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> to be set.) Matches zero or more occurrences of the pattern  <i>x</i>. This operator has high precedence; ` <b>12#</b>' is equivalent to `<b>1(2#)</b>', rather than ` <b>(12)#</b>'.  It is an error for an unquoted `<b>#</b>' to follow something which cannot be repeated; this includes an empty string, a pattern already followed by ` <b>##</b>', or parentheses when part of a  <b>KSH_GLOB</b> pattern (for example, `<b>!(</b><i>foo</i><b>)#</b>' is invalid and must be replaced by ` <b>*(!(</b><i>foo</i><b>))</b>').</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>x</i><b>##</b></dt>
<dd>
(Requires <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> to be set.) Matches one or more occurrences of the pattern  <i>x</i>. This operator has high precedence; ` <b>12##</b>' is equivalent to `<b>1(2##)</b>', rather than ` <b>(12)##</b>'.  No more than two active `<b>#</b>' characters may appear together.

<h2>Precedence</h2> The precedence of the operators given above is (highest) ` <b>^</b>', `<b>/</b>', ` <b>~</b>', `<b>|</b>' (lowest); the remaining operators are simply treated from left to right as part of a string, with ` <b>#</b>' and `<b>##</b>' applying to the shortest possible preceding unit (i.e. a character, ` <b>?</b>', `<b>[</b>...<b>]</b>', ` <b>&lt;</b>...<b>&gt;</b>', or a parenthesised expression).  As mentioned above, a ` <b>/</b>' used as a directory separator may not appear inside parentheses, while a ` <b>|</b>' must do so; in patterns used in other contexts than filename generation (for example, in  <b>case</b> statements and tests within ` <b>[[</b>...<b>]]</b>'), a `<b>/</b>' is not special; and `<b>/</b>' is also not special after a ` <b>~</b>' appearing outside parentheses in a filename pattern.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Globbing Flags</h2> There are various flags which affect any text to their right up to the end of the enclosing group or to the end of the pattern; they require the  <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> option. All take the form  <b>(#</b><i>X</i><b>)</b> where <i>X</i> may have one of the following forms:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>i</b> Case insensitive:  upper or lower case characters in the pattern match upper or lower case characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>l</b></dt>
<dd>
Lower case characters in the pattern match upper or lower case characters; upper case characters in the pattern still only match upper case characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>I</b></dt>
<dd>
Case sensitive:  locally negates the effect of <b>i</b> or <b>l</b> from that point on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>b</b></dt>
<dd>
Activate backreferences for parenthesised groups in the pattern; this does not work in filename generation.  When a pattern with a set of active parentheses is matched, the strings matched by the groups are stored in the array  <b>$match</b>, the indices of the beginning of the matched parentheses in the array  <b>$mbegin</b>, and the indices of the end in the array  <b>$mend</b>, with the first element of each array corresponding to the first parenthesised group, and so on.  These arrays are not otherwise special to the shell.  The indices use the same convention as does parameter substitution, so that elements of  <b>$mend</b> and <b>$mbegin</b> may be used in subscripts; the  <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is respected.  Sets of globbing flags are not considered parenthesised groups; only the first nine active parentheses can be referenced.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>foo=&quot;a string with a message&quot;</b><br/>
<b>if [[ $foo = (a|an)' '(#b)(*)' '* ]]; then</b><br/>
<b>  print ${foo[$mbegin[1],$mend[1]]}</b><br/>
<b>fi</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
prints `<b>string with a</b>'.  Note that the first parenthesis is before the  <b>(#b)</b> and does not create a backreference.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Backreferences work with all forms of pattern matching other than filename generation, but note that when performing matches on an entire array, such as  <b>${</b><i>array</i><b>#</b><i>pattern</i><b>}</b>, or a global substitution, such as  <b>${</b><i>param</i><b>//</b><i>pat</i><b>/</b><i>repl</i><b>}</b>, only the data for the last match remains available.  In the case of global replacements this may still be useful.  See the example for the  <b>m</b> flag below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The numbering of backreferences strictly follows the order of the opening parentheses from left to right in the pattern string, although sets of parentheses may be nested.  There are special rules for parentheses followed by ` <b>#</b>' or `<b>##</b>'.  Only the last match of the parenthesis is remembered: for example, in ` <b>[[ abab = (#b)([ab])# ]]</b>', only the final ` <b>b</b>' is stored in <b>match[1]</b>.  Thus extra parentheses may be necessary to match the complete segment: for example, use ` <b>X((ab|cd)#)Y</b>' to match a whole string of either ` <b>ab</b>' or `<b>cd</b>' between `<b>X</b>' and `<b>Y</b>', using the value of  <b>$match[1]</b> rather than <b>$match[2]</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the match fails none of the parameters is altered, so in some cases it may be necessary to initialise them beforehand.  If some of the backreferences fail to match -- which happens if they are in an alternate branch which fails to match, or if they are followed by  <b>#</b> and matched zero times -- then the matched string is set to the empty string, and the start and end indices are set to -1.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Pattern matching with backreferences is slightly slower than without.</div>

<b>B</b></dt>

Deactivate backreferences, negating the effect of the <b>b</b> flag from that point on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>c</b><i>N</i><b>,</b><i>M</i></dt>
<dd>
The flag <b>(#c</b><i>N</i><b>,</b><i>M</i><b>)</b> can be used anywhere that the  <b>#</b> or <b>##</b> operators can be used except in the expressions ` <b>(*/)#</b>' and `<b>(*/)##</b>' in filename generation, where `<b>/</b>' has special meaning; it cannot be combined with other globbing flags and a bad pattern error occurs if it is misplaced.  It is equivalent to the form  <b>{</b><i>N</i><b>,</b><i>M</i><b>}</b> in regular expressions.  The previous character or group is required to match between  <i>N</i> and <i>M</i> times, inclusive.  The form  <b>(#c</b><i>N</i><b>)</b> requires exactly <b>N</b> matches;  <b>(#c,</b><i>M</i><b>)</b> is equivalent to specifying <i>N</i> as 0;  <b>(#c</b><i>N</i><b>,)</b> specifies that there is no maximum limit on the number of matches.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>m</b></dt>
<dd>
Set references to the match data for the entire string matched; this is similar to backreferencing and does not work in filename generation.  The flag must be in effect at the end of the pattern, i.e. not local to a group. The parameters  <b>$MATCH</b>,  <b>$MBEGIN</b> and <b>$MEND</b> will be set to the string matched and to the indices of the beginning and end of the string, respectively.  This is most useful in parameter substitutions, as otherwise the string matched is obvious.</dd>

Unlike the other flags, these have only a local effect, and each must appear on its own:  ` <b>(#s)</b>' and `<b>(#e)</b>' are the only valid forms. The ` <b>(#s)</b>' flag succeeds only at the start of the test string, and the ` <b>(#e)</b>' flag succeeds only at the end of the test string; they correspond to ` <b>^</b>' and `<b>$</b>' in standard regular expressions.  They are useful for matching path segments in patterns other than those in filename generation (where path segments are in any case treated separately).  For example, ` <b>*((#s)|/)test((#e)|/)*</b>' matches a path segment ` <b>test</b>' in any of the following strings: <b>test</b>,  <b>test/at/start</b>, <b>at/end/test</b>, <b>in/test/middle</b>.</dd>

Another use is in parameter substitution; for example ` <b>${array/(#s)A*Z(#e)}</b>' will remove only elements of an array which match the complete pattern ` <b>A*Z</b>'.  There are other ways of performing many operations of this type, however the combination of the substitution operations ` <b>/</b>' and `<b>//</b>' with the `<b>(#s)</b>' and `<b>(#e)</b>' flags provides a single simple and memorable method.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that assertions of the form `<b>(^(#s))</b>' also work, i.e. match anywhere except at the start of the string, although this actually means `anything except a zero-length portion at the start of the string'; you need to use ` <b>(&quot;&quot;~(#s))</b>' to match a zero-length portion of the string not at the start.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>q</b></dt>
<dd>
A `<b>q</b>' and everything up to the closing parenthesis of the globbing flags are ignored by the pattern matching code.  This is intended to support the use of glob qualifiers, see below.  The result is that the pattern ` <b>(#b)(*).c(#q.)</b>' can be used both for globbing and for matching against a string.  In the former case, the ` <b>(#q.)</b>' will be treated as a glob qualifier and the ` <b>(#b)</b>' will not be useful, while in the latter case the ` <b>(#b)</b>' is useful for backreferences and the ` <b>(#q.)</b>' will be ignored.  Note that colon modifiers in the glob qualifiers are also not applied in ordinary pattern matching.</dd>

<dt>
<b>u</b></dt>
<dd>
Respect the current locale in determining the presence of multibyte characters in a pattern, provided the shell was compiled with  <b>MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT</b>.  This overrides the <b>MULTIBYTE</b> option; the default behaviour is taken from the option.  Compare  <b>U</b>. (Mnemonic: typically multibyte characters are from Unicode in the UTF-8 encoding, although any extension of ASCII supported by the system library may be used.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>U</b></dt>
<dd>
All characters are considered to be a single byte long.  The opposite of  <b>u</b>.  This overrides the <b>MULTIBYTE</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, the test string <b>fooxx</b> can be matched by the pattern  <b>(#i</b><b>)FOOXX</b>, but not by <b>(#l</b><b>)FOOXX</b>,  <b>(#i</b><b>)FOO</b><b>(#I</b><b>)XX</b> or  <b>((#i</b><b>)FOOX</b><b>)X</b>.  The string  <b>(#ia2</b><b>)readme</b> specifies case-insensitive matching of  <b>readme</b> with up to two errors.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When using the ksh syntax for grouping both <b>KSH_GLOB</b> and  <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> must be set and the left parenthesis should be preceded by  <b>@</b>.  Note also that the flags do not affect letters inside  <b>[...]</b> groups, in other words <b>(#i</b><b>)[a-z]</b> still matches only lowercase letters.  Finally, note that when examining whole paths case-insensitively every directory must be searched for all files which match, so that a pattern of the form  <b>(#i</b><b>)/foo/bar/...</b> is potentially slow.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Approximate Matching</h2> When matching approximately, the shell keeps a count of the errors found, which cannot exceed the number specified in the  <b>(#a</b><i>num</i><b>)</b> flags.  Four types of error are recognised:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
1. Different characters, as in  <b>fooxbar</b> and <b>fooybar</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2.</dt>
<dd>
Transposition of characters, as in <b>banana</b> and <b>abnana</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
3.</dt>
<dd>
A character missing in the target string, as with the pattern <b>road</b> and target string  <b>rod</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
4.</dt>
<dd>
An extra character appearing in the target string, as with <b>stove</b> and  <b>strove</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Thus, the pattern <b>(#a3</b><b>)abcd</b> matches <b>dcba</b>, with the errors occurring by using the first rule twice and the second once, grouping the string as  <b>[d][cb][a]</b> and <b>[a][bc][d]</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Non-literal parts of the pattern must match exactly, including characters in character ranges: hence  <b>(#a1</b><b>)???</b>  matches strings of length four, by applying rule 4 to an empty part of the pattern, but not strings of length two, since all the  <b>?</b> must match.  Other characters which must match exactly are initial dots in filenames (unless the  <b>GLOB_DOTS</b> option is set), and all slashes in filenames, so that  <b>a/bc</b> is two errors from <b>ab/c</b> (the slash cannot be transposed with another character).  Similarly, errors are counted separately for non-contiguous strings in the pattern, so that  <b>(ab|cd</b><b>)ef</b> is two errors from  <b>aebf</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When using exclusion via the <b>~</b> operator, approximate matching is treated entirely separately for the excluded part and must be activated separately.  Thus,  <b>(#a1</b><b>)README~READ_ME</b> matches  <b>READ.ME</b> but not <b>READ_ME</b>, as the trailing <b>READ_ME</b> is matched without approximation.  However,  <b>(#a1</b><b>)README~(#a1</b><b>)READ_ME</b> does not match any pattern of the form  <b>READ</b><i>?</i><b>ME</b> as all such forms are now excluded.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Apart from exclusions, there is only one overall error count; however, the maximum errors allowed may be altered locally, and this can be delimited by grouping.  For example,  <b>(#a1</b><b>)cat</b><b>((#a0</b><b>)dog</b><b>)fox</b> allows one error in total, which may not occur in the  <b>dog</b> section, and the pattern  <b>(#a1</b><b>)cat</b><b>(#a0</b><b>)dog</b><b>(#a1</b><b>)fox</b> is equivalent.  Note that the point at which an error is first found is the crucial one for establishing whether to use approximation; for example,  <b>(#a1)abc(#a0)xyz</b> will not match <b>abcdxyz</b>, because the error occurs at the ` <b>x</b>', where approximation is turned off.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Entire path segments may be matched approximately, so that ` <b>(#a1)/foo/d/is/available/at/the/bar</b>' allows one error in any path segment.  This is much less efficient than without the  <b>(#a1)</b>, however, since every directory in the path must be scanned for a possible approximate match.  It is best to place the  <b>(#a1)</b> after any path segments which are known to be correct.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Recursive Globbing</h2> A pathname component of the form ` <b>(</b><i>foo</i><b>/)#</b>' matches a path consisting of zero or more directories matching the pattern  <i>foo</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a shorthand, `<b>**/</b>' is equivalent to `<b>(*/)#</b>'; note that this therefore matches files in the current directory as well as subdirectories. Thus:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>ls (*/)#bar</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
or<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>ls **/bar</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
does a recursive directory search for files named `<b>bar</b>' (potentially including the file ` <b>bar</b>' in the current directory).  This form does not follow symbolic links; the alternative form ` <b>***/</b>' does, but is otherwise identical.  Neither of these can be combined with other forms of globbing within the same path segment; in that case, the ` <b>*</b>' operators revert to their usual effect.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Glob Qualifiers</h2> Patterns used for filename generation may end in a list of qualifiers enclosed in parentheses. The qualifiers specify which filenames that otherwise match the given pattern will be inserted in the argument list.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the option <b>BARE_GLOB_QUAL</b> is set, then a trailing set of parentheses containing no ` <b>|</b>' or `<b>(</b>' characters (or `<b>~</b>' if it is special) is taken as a set of glob qualifiers.  A glob subexpression that would normally be taken as glob qualifiers, for example ` <b>(^x)</b>', can be forced to be treated as part of the glob pattern by doubling the parentheses, in this case producing ` <b>((^x))</b>'.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the option <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> is set, a different syntax for glob qualifiers is available, namely ` <b>(#qx)</b>' where <b>x</b> is any of the same glob qualifiers used in the other format.  The qualifiers must still appear at the end of the pattern.  However, with this syntax multiple glob qualifiers may be chained together.  They are treated as a logical AND of the individual sets of flags.  Also, as the syntax is unambiguous, the expression will be treated as glob qualifiers just as long any parentheses contained within it are balanced; appearance of ` <b>|</b>', `<b>(</b>' or ` <b>~</b>' does not negate the effect.  Note that qualifiers will be recognised in this form even if a bare glob qualifier exists at the end of the pattern, for example ` <b>*(#q*)(.)</b>' will recognise executable regular files if both options are set; however, mixed syntax should probably be avoided for the sake of clarity.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A qualifier may be any one of the following:<div class="spacer">

<b>f</b><i>spec</i></dt>
<dd>
files with access rights matching <i>spec</i>. This <i>spec</i> may be a octal number optionally preceded by a ` <b>=</b>', a `<b>+</b>', or a ` <b>-</b>'. If none of these characters is given, the behavior is the same as for ` <b>=</b>'. The octal number describes the mode bits to be expected, if combined with a ` <b>=</b>', the value given must match the file-modes exactly, with a ` <b>+</b>', at least the bits in the given number must be set in the file-modes, and with a ` <b>-</b>', the bits in the number must not be set. Giving a ` <b>?</b>' instead of a octal digit anywhere in the number ensures that the corresponding bits in the file-modes are not checked, this is only useful in combination with ` <b>=</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the qualifier `<b>f</b>' is followed by any other character anything up to the next matching character (` <b>[</b>', `<b>{</b>', and `<b>&lt;</b>' match ` <b>]</b>', `<b>}</b>', and `<b>&gt;</b>' respectively, any other character matches itself) is taken as a list of comma-separated  <i>sub-spec</i>s. Each <i>sub-spec</i> may be either an octal number as described above or a list of any of the characters ` <b>u</b>', `<b>g</b>', ` <b>o</b>', and `<b>a</b>', followed by a `<b>=</b>', a `<b>+</b>', or a ` <b>-</b>', followed by a list of any of the characters `<b>r</b>', `<b>w</b>', ` <b>x</b>', `<b>s</b>', and `<b>t</b>', or an octal digit. The first list of characters specify which access rights are to be checked. If a ` <b>u</b>' is given, those for the owner of the file are used, if a ` <b>g</b>' is given, those of the group are checked, a ` <b>o</b>' means to test those of other users, and the ` <b>a</b>' says to test all three groups. The ` <b>=</b>', `<b>+</b>', and `<b>-</b>' again says how the modes are to be checked and have the same meaning as described for the first form above. The second list of characters finally says which access rights are to be expected: ` <b>r</b>' for read access, `<b>w</b>' for write access, ` <b>x</b>' for the right to execute the file (or to search a directory), ` <b>s</b>' for the setuid and setgid bits, and `<b>t</b>' for the sticky bit.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Thus, `<b>*(f70?)</b>' gives the files for which the owner has read, write, and execute permission, and for which other group members have no rights, independent of the permissions for other users. The pattern ` <b>*(f-100)</b>' gives all files for which the owner does not have execute permission, and ` <b>*(f:gu+w,o-rx:)</b>' gives the files for which the owner and the other members of the group have at least write permission, and for which other users don't have read or execute permission.</div>

<dt>

<dd>

<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>+</b><i>cmd</i> The  <i>string</i> will be executed as shell code.  The filename will be included in the list if and only if the code returns a zero status (usually the status of the last command).</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the first form, the first character after the `<b>e</b>' will be used as a separator and anything up to the next matching separator will be taken  as the  <i>string</i>; `<b>[</b>', `<b>{</b>', and `<b>&lt;</b>' match ` <b>]</b>', `<b>}</b>', and `<b>&gt;</b>', respectively, while any other character matches itself. Note that expansions must be quoted in the  <i>string</i> to prevent them from being expanded before globbing is done.  <i>string</i> is then executed as shell code.  The string <b>globqual</b> is appended to the array  <b>zsh_eval_context</b> the duration of execution.<div class="spacer">
</div>
During the execution of <i>string</i> the filename currently being tested is available in the parameter  <b>REPLY</b>; the parameter may be altered to a string to be inserted into the list instead of the original filename.  In addition, the parameter  <b>reply</b> may be set to an array or a string, which overrides the value of  <b>REPLY</b>.  If set to an array, the latter is inserted into the command line word by word.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, suppose a directory contains a single file `<b>lonely</b>'.  Then the expression ` <b>*(e:'reply=(${REPLY}{1,2})':)</b>' will cause the words ` <b>lonely1</b>' and `<b>lonely2</b>' to be inserted into the command line.  Note the quoting of  <i>string</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The form <b>+</b><i>cmd</i> has the same effect, but no delimiters appear around  <i>cmd</i>.  Instead, <i>cmd</i> is taken as the longest sequence of characters following the  <b>+</b> that are alphanumeric or underscore. Typically  <i>cmd</i> will be the name of a shell function that contains the appropriate test.  For example,<div class="spacer">

The starting separators ` <b>[</b>', `<b>{</b>', and `<b>&lt;</b>' match the final separators ` <b>]</b>', `<b>}</b>', and `<b>&gt;</b>', respectively; any other character matches itself.  The selected files are those owned by this user.  For example, ` <b>u:foo:</b>' or `<b>u[foo]</b>' selects files owned by user ` <b>foo</b>'.</dd>

Files accessed more than  <i>n</i> days ago are selected by a positive <i>n</i> value ( <b>+</b><i>n</i>).  Optional unit specifiers `<b>M</b>', `<b>w</b>', ` <b>h</b>', `<b>m</b>' or `<b>s</b>' (e.g. `<b>ah5</b>') cause the check to be performed with months (of 30 days), weeks, hours, minutes or seconds instead of days, respectively.</dd>

<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any fractional part of the difference between the access time and the current part in the appropriate units is ignored in the comparison.

If this flag is directly followed by a `<b>k</b>' (`<b>K</b>'), `<b>m</b>' (` <b>M</b>'), or `<b>p</b>' (`<b>P</b>') (e.g. `<b>Lk-50</b>') the check is performed with kilobytes, megabytes, or blocks (of 512 bytes) instead.  In this case a file is regarded as &quot;exactly&quot; the size if the file size rounded up to the next unit is equal to the test size.  Hence ` <b>*(Lm1)</b>' matches files from 1 byte up to 1 Megabyte inclusive.

Note that  <b>a</b>, <b>m</b>, and <b>c</b> compare the age against the current time, hence the first name in the list is the youngest file. Also note that the modifiers  <b>^</b> and <b>-</b> are used, so ` <b>*(^-oL)</b>' gives a list of all files sorted by file size in descending order, following any symbolic links.

specifies which of the matched filenames should be included in the returned list. The syntax is the same as for array subscripts.  <i>beg</i> and the optional <i>end</i> may be mathematical expressions. As in parameter subscripting they may be negative to make them count from the last match backward. E.g.: ` <b>*(-OL[1,3])</b>' gives a list of the names of the three largest files.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>P</b><i>string</i></dt>
<dd>
The <i>string</i> will be prepended to each glob match as a separate word.   <i>string</i> is delimited in the same way as arguments to the  <b>e</b> glob qualifier described above.  The qualifier can be repeated; the words are prepended separately so that the resulting command line contains the words in the same order they were given in the list of glob qualifiers.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
A typical use for this is to prepend an option before all occurrences of a file name; for example, the pattern ` <b>*(P:-f:)</b>' produces the command line arguments ` <b>-f</b> <i>file1</i> <b>-f</b> <i>file2</i> ...'</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
More than one of these lists can be combined, separated by commas. The whole list matches if at least one of the sublists matches (they are `or'ed, the qualifiers in the sublists are `and'ed).  Some qualifiers, however, affect all matches generated, independent of the sublist in which they are given.  These are the qualifiers ` <b>M</b>', `<b>T</b>', ` <b>N</b>', `<b>D</b>', `<b>n</b>', `<b>o</b>', `<b>O</b>' and the subscripts given in brackets (` <b>[...]</b>').<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a `<b>:</b>' appears in a qualifier list, the remainder of the expression in parenthesis is interpreted as a modifier (see the section `Modifiers' in the section `History Expansion').  Each modifier must be introduced by a separate ` <b>:</b>'.  Note also that the result after modification does not have to be an existing file.  The name of any existing file can be followed by a modifier of the form ` <b>(:..)</b>' even if no actual filename generation is performed, although note that the presence of the parentheses causes the entire expression to be subjected to any global pattern matching options such as  <b>NULL_GLOB</b>.
