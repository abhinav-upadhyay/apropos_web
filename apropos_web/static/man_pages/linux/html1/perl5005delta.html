<h1>NAME</h1> perl5005delta - what's new for perl5.005</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.004 release and this one.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>About the new versioning system</h1> Perl is now developed on two tracks: a maintenance track that makes small, safe updates to released production versions with emphasis on compatibility; and a development track that pursues more aggressive evolution.  Maintenance releases (which should be considered production quality) have subversion numbers that run from 1 to 49, and development releases (which should be considered &quot;alpha&quot; quality) run from 50 to 99.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl 5.005 is the combined product of the new dual-track development scheme.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>WARNING:  This version is not binary compatible with Perl 5.004.</h2> Starting with Perl 5.004_50 there were many deep and far-reaching changes to the language internals.  If you have dynamically loaded extensions that you built under perl 5.003 or 5.004, you can continue to use them with 5.004, but you will need to rebuild and reinstall those extensions to use them 5.005.  See  <i>INSTALL</i> for detailed instructions on how to upgrade.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Default installation structure has changed</h2> The new Configure defaults are designed to allow a smooth upgrade from 5.004 to 5.005, but you should read  <i>INSTALL</i> for a detailed discussion of the changes in order to adapt them to your system.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Perl Source Compatibility</h2> When none of the experimental features are enabled, there should be very few user-visible Perl source compatibility issues.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If threads are enabled, then some caveats apply. @_ and $_ become lexical variables.  The effect of this should be largely transparent to the user, but there are some boundary conditions under which user will need to be aware of the issues.  For example, &quot;local(@_)&quot; results in a &quot;Can't localize lexical variable @_ ...&quot; message.  This may be enabled in a future version.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some new keywords have been introduced.  These are generally expected to have very little impact on compatibility.  See &quot;New &quot;INIT&quot; keyword&quot;, &quot;New &quot;lock&quot; keyword&quot;, and &quot;New &quot;qr//&quot; operator&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Certain barewords are now reserved.  Use of these will provoke a warning if you have asked for them with the &quot;-w&quot; switch. See &quot;&quot;our&quot; is now a reserved word&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>C Source Compatibility</h2> There have been a large number of changes in the internals to support the new features in this release.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Core sources now require ANSI C compiler<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An ANSI C compiler is now <b>required</b> to build perl.  See <i>INSTALL</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
All Perl global variables must now be referenced with an explicit prefix<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
All Perl global variables that are visible for use by extensions now have a &quot;PL_&quot; prefix.  New extensions should &quot;not&quot; refer to perl globals by their unqualified names.  To preserve sanity, we provide limited backward compatibility for globals that are being widely used like &quot;sv_undef&quot; and &quot;na&quot; (which should now be written as &quot;PL_sv_undef&quot;, &quot;PL_na&quot; etc.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you find that your XS extension does not compile anymore because a perl global is not visible, try adding a &quot;PL_&quot; prefix to the global and rebuild.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It is strongly recommended that all functions in the Perl API that don't begin with &quot;perl&quot; be referenced with a &quot;Perl_&quot; prefix.  The bare function names without the &quot;Perl_&quot; prefix are supported with macros, but this support may cease in a future release.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See perlapi.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Enabling threads has source compatibility issues<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl built with threading enabled requires extensions to use the new &quot;dTHR&quot; macro to initialize the handle to access per-thread data. If you see a compiler error that talks about the variable &quot;thr&quot; not being declared (when building a module that has XS code),  you need to add &quot;dTHR;&quot; at the beginning of the block that elicited the error.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The API function &quot;perl_get_sv(&quot;@&quot;,GV_ADD)&quot; should be used instead of directly accessing perl globals as &quot;GvSV(errgv)&quot;.  The API call is backward compatible with existing perls and provides source compatibility with threading is enabled.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;C Source Compatibility&quot; for more information.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Binary Compatibility</h2> This version is NOT binary compatible with older versions.  All extensions will need to be recompiled.  Further binaries built with threads enabled are incompatible with binaries built without.  This should largely be transparent to the user, as all binary incompatible configurations have their own unique architecture name, and extension binaries get installed at unique locations.  This allows coexistence of several configurations in the same directory hierarchy.  See  <i>INSTALL</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Security fixes may affect compatibility</h2> A few taint leaks and taint omissions have been corrected.  This may lead to &quot;failure&quot; of scripts that used to work with older versions.  Compiling with -DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS provides a perl with minimal amounts of changes to the tainting behavior.  But note that the resulting perl will have known insecurities.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Oneliners with the &quot;-e&quot; switch do not create temporary files anymore.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Relaxed new mandatory warnings introduced in 5.004</h2> Many new warnings that were introduced in 5.004 have been made optional.  Some of these warnings are still present, but perl's new features make them less often a problem.  See &quot;New Diagnostics&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Licensing</h2> Perl has a new Social Contract for contributors.  See  <i>Porting/Contract</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The license included in much of the Perl documentation has changed. Most of the Perl documentation was previously under the implicit GNU General Public License or the Artistic License (at the user's choice). Now much of the documentation unambiguously states the terms under which it may be distributed.  Those terms are in general much less restrictive than the GNU GPL.  See perl and the individual perl manpages listed therein.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Threads</h2> WARNING: Threading is considered an  <b>experimental</b> feature.  Details of the implementation may change without notice.  There are known limitations and some bugs.  These are expected to be fixed in future versions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See <i>README.threads</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Compiler</h2> WARNING: The Compiler and related tools are considered  <b>experimental</b>. Features may change without notice, and there are known limitations and bugs.  Since the compiler is fully external to perl, the default configuration will build and install it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Compiler produces three different types of transformations of a perl program.  The C backend generates C code that captures perl's state just before execution begins.  It eliminates the compile-time overheads of the regular perl interpreter, but the run-time performance remains comparatively the same.  The CC backend generates optimized C code equivalent to the code path at run-time.  The CC backend has greater potential for big optimizations, but only a few optimizations are implemented currently.  The Bytecode backend generates a platform independent bytecode representation of the interpreter's state just before execution.  Thus, the Bytecode back end also eliminates much of the compilation overhead of the interpreter.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The compiler comes with several valuable utilities.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;B::Lint&quot; is an experimental module to detect and warn about suspicious code, especially the cases that the &quot;-w&quot; switch does not detect.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;B::Deparse&quot; can be used to demystify perl code, and understand how perl optimizes certain constructs.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;B::Xref&quot; generates cross reference reports of all definition and use of variables, subroutines and formats in a program.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;B::Showlex&quot; show the lexical variables used by a subroutine or file at a glance.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;perlcc&quot; is a simple frontend for compiling perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;ext/B/README&quot;, B, and the respective compiler modules.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Regular Expressions</h2> Perl's regular expression engine has been seriously overhauled, and many new constructs are supported.  Several bugs have been fixed.<div class="spacer">

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Improved <i>malloc()</i></h2> See banner at the beginning of &quot;malloc.c&quot; for details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Quicksort is internally implemented</h2> Perl now contains its own highly optimized  <i>qsort()</i> routine.  The new <i>qsort()</i> is resistant to inconsistent comparison functions, so Perl's &quot;sort()&quot; will not provoke coredumps any more when given poorly written sort subroutines. (Some C library &quot;qsort()&quot;s that were being used before used to have this problem.)  In our testing, the new &quot;qsort()&quot; required the minimal number of pair-wise compares on average, among all known &quot;qsort()&quot; implementations.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;perlfunc/sort&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Reliable signals</h2> Perl's signal handling is susceptible to random crashes, because signals arrive asynchronously, and the Perl runtime is not reentrant at arbitrary times.<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, one experimental implementation of reliable signals is available when threads are enabled.  See &quot;Thread::Signal&quot;.  Also see  <i>INSTALL</i> for how to build a Perl capable of threads.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Reliable stack pointers</h2> The internals now reallocate the perl stack only at predictable times. In particular, magic calls never trigger reallocations of the stack, because all reentrancy of the runtime is handled using a &quot;stack of stacks&quot;. This should improve reliability of cached stack pointers in the internals and in XSUBs.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>More generous treatment of carriage returns</h2> Perl used to complain if it encountered literal carriage returns in scripts.  Now they are mostly treated like whitespace within program text. Inside string literals and here documents, literal carriage returns are ignored if they occur paired with linefeeds, or get interpreted as whitespace if they stand alone.  This behavior means that literal carriage returns in files should be avoided.  You can get the older, more compatible (but less generous) behavior by defining the preprocessor symbol &quot;PERL_STRICT_CR&quot; when building perl.  Of course, all this has nothing whatever to do with how escapes like &quot;\r&quot; are handled within strings.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that this doesn't somehow magically allow you to keep all text files in DOS format.  The generous treatment only applies to files that perl itself parses.  If your C compiler doesn't allow carriage returns in files, you may still be unable to build modules that need a C compiler.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Memory leaks</h2> &quot;substr&quot;, &quot;pos&quot; and &quot;vec&quot; don't leak memory anymore when used in lvalue context.  Many small leaks that impacted applications that embed multiple interpreters have been fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Better support for multiple interpreters</h2> The build-time option &quot;-DMULTIPLICITY&quot; has had many of the details reworked.  Some previously global variables that should have been per-interpreter now are.  With care, this allows interpreters to call each other.  See the &quot;PerlInterp&quot; extension on CPAN.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Behavior of <i>local()</i> on array and hash elements is now well-defined</h2> See &quot;Temporary Values via  <i>local()</i>&quot; in perlsub.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;%!&quot; is transparently tied to the Errno module</h2> See perlvar, and Errno.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Pseudo-hashes are supported</h2> See perlref.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;EXPR foreach EXPR&quot; is supported</h2> See perlsyn.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Keywords can be globally overridden</h2> See perlsub.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>$^E is meaningful on Win32</h2> See perlvar.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;foreach (1..1000000)&quot; optimized</h2> &quot;foreach (1..1000000)&quot; is now optimized into a counting loop.  It does not try to allocate a 1000000-size list anymore.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;Foo::&quot; can be used as implicitly quoted package name</h2> Barewords caused unintuitive behavior when a subroutine with the same name as a package happened to be defined.  Thus, &quot;new Foo @args&quot;, use the result of the call to &quot;Foo()&quot; instead of &quot;Foo&quot; being treated as a literal.  The recommended way to write barewords in the indirect object slot is &quot;new Foo:: @args&quot;.  Note that the method &quot;new()&quot; is called with a first argument of &quot;Foo&quot;, not &quot;Foo::&quot; when you do that.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;exists $Foo::{Bar::}&quot; tests existence of a package</h2> It was impossible to test for the existence of a package without actually creating it before.  Now &quot;exists $Foo::{Bar::}&quot; can be used to test if the &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; namespace has been created.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Better locale support</h2> See perllocale.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Experimental support for 64-bit platforms</h2> Perl5 has always had 64-bit support on systems with 64-bit longs. Starting with 5.005, the beginnings of experimental support for systems with 32-bit long and 64-bit 'long long' integers has been added. If you add -DUSE_LONG_LONG to your ccflags in config.sh (or manually define it in perl.h) then perl will be built with 'long long' support. There will be many compiler warnings, and the resultant perl may not work on all systems.  There are many other issues related to third-party extensions and libraries.  This option exists to allow people to work on those issues.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>prototype()</i> returns useful results on builtins</h2> See &quot;prototype&quot; in perlfunc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Extended support for exception handling</h2> &quot;die()&quot; now accepts a reference value, and $@ gets set to that value in exception traps.  This makes it possible to propagate exception objects.  This is an undocumented  <b>experimental</b> feature.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Re-blessing in <i>DESTROY()</i> supported for chaining <i>DESTROY()</i> methods</h2> See &quot;Destructors&quot; in perlobj.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>All &quot;printf&quot; format conversions are handled internally</h2> See &quot;printf&quot; in perlfunc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New &quot;INIT&quot; keyword</h2> &quot;INIT&quot; subs are like &quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;END&quot;, but they get run just before the perl runtime begins execution.  e.g., the Perl Compiler makes use of &quot;INIT&quot; blocks to initialize and resolve pointers to XSUBs.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New &quot;lock&quot; keyword</h2> The &quot;lock&quot; keyword is the fundamental synchronization primitive in threaded perl.  When threads are not enabled, it is currently a noop.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To minimize impact on source compatibility this keyword is &quot;weak&quot;, i.e., any user-defined subroutine of the same name overrides it, unless a &quot;use Thread&quot; has been seen.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New &quot;qr//&quot; operator</h2> The &quot;qr//&quot; operator, which is syntactically similar to the other quote-like operators, is used to create precompiled regular expressions.  This compiled form can now be explicitly passed around in variables, and interpolated in other regular expressions.  See perlop.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;our&quot; is now a reserved word</h2> Calling a subroutine with the name &quot;our&quot; will now provoke a warning when using the &quot;-w&quot; switch.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Tied arrays are now fully supported</h2> See Tie::Array.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Tied handles support is better</h2> Several missing hooks have been added.  There is also a new base class for TIEARRAY implementations.  See Tie::Array.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>4th argument to substr</h2>  <i>substr()</i> can now both return and replace in one operation.  The optional 4th argument is the replacement string.  See &quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Negative LENGTH argument to splice</h2>  <i>splice()</i> with a negative LENGTH argument now work similar to what the LENGTH did for  <i>substr()</i>.  Previously a negative LENGTH was treated as 0.  See &quot;splice&quot; in perlfunc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Magic lvalues are now more magical</h2> When you say something like &quot;substr($x, 5) = &quot;hi&quot;&quot;, the scalar returned by  <i>substr()</i> is special, in that any modifications to it affect $x. (This is called a 'magic lvalue' because an 'lvalue' is something on the left side of an assignment.)  Normally, this is exactly what you would expect to happen, but Perl uses the same magic if you use  <i>substr()</i>,  <i>pos()</i>, or <i>vec()</i> in a context where they might be modified, like taking a reference with &quot;\&quot; or as an argument to a sub that modifies @_. In previous versions, this 'magic' only went one way, but now changes to the scalar the magic refers to ($x in the above example) affect the magic lvalue too. For instance, this code now acts differently:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $x = &quot;hello&quot;;<br/>
    sub printit {<br/>
        $x = &quot;g'bye&quot;;<br/>
        print $_[0], &quot;\n&quot;;<br/>
    }<br/>
    printit(substr($x, 0, 5));<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In previous versions, this would print &quot;hello&quot;, but it now prints &quot;g'bye&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&lt;&gt; now reads in records</h2> If $/ is a reference to an integer, or a scalar that holds an integer, &lt;&gt; will read in records instead of lines. For more info, see &quot;$/&quot; in perlvar.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Supported Platforms</h1> Configure has many incremental improvements.  Site-wide policy for building perl can now be made persistent, via Policy.sh.  Configure also records the command-line arguments used in  <i>config.sh</i>.<div class="subsection">

More Fcntl constants added: F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64, O_LARGEFILE for large (more than 4G) file access (the 64-bit support is not yet working, though, so no need to get overly excited), Free/Net/OpenBSD locking behaviour flags F_FLOCK, F_POSIX, Linux F_SHLCK, and O_ACCMODE: the mask of O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR.</dd>

MakeMaker</dt>
<dd>
MakeMaker now supports writing empty makefiles, provides a way to specify that site  <i>umask()</i> policy should be honored.  There is also better support for manipulation of .packlist files, and getting information about installed modules.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Extensions that have both architecture-dependent and architecture-independent files are now always installed completely in the architecture-dependent locations.  Previously, the shareable parts were shared both across architectures and across perl versions and were therefore liable to be overwritten with newer versions that might have subtle incompatibilities.</dd>

<h1>New Diagnostics</h1><dl>
<dt>
Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</dt>
<dd>
(W) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is not imported.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's imported with the &quot;use subs&quot; pragma).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the &quot;CORE::&quot; prefix on the operator (e.g. &quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;) or by declaring the subroutine to be an object method (see attrs).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bad index while coercing array into hash</dt>
<dd>
(F) The index looked up in the hash found as the 0'th element of a pseudo-hash is not legal.  Index values must be at 1 or greater. See perlref.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers to nonexistent package</dt>
<dd>
(W) You used a qualified bareword of the form &quot;Foo::&quot;, but the compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that point. Perhaps you need to predeclare a package?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the object reference or package name contains an undefined value. Something like this will reproduce the error:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $BADREF = 42;<br/>
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;<br/>
    $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't check filesystem of script &quot;%s&quot; for nosuid</dt>
<dd>
(P) For some reason you can't check the filesystem of the script for nosuid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't coerce array into hash</dt>
<dd>
(F) You used an array where a hash was expected, but the array has no information on how to map from keys to array indices.  You can do that only with arrays that have a hash reference at index 0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't goto subroutine from an eval-string</dt>
<dd>
(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can't be used to jump out of an eval &quot;string&quot;. (You can use it to jump out of an eval {BLOCK}, but you probably don't want to.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't localize pseudo-hash element</dt>
<dd>
(F) You said something like &quot;local $ar-&gt;{'key'}&quot;, where $ar is a reference to a pseudo-hash.  That hasn't been implemented yet, but you can get a similar effect by localizing the corresponding array element directly: &quot;local $ar-&gt;[$ar-&gt;[0]{'key'}]&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Can't use %%! because Errno.pm is not available</dt>
<dd>
(F) The first time the %! hash is used, perl automatically loads the Errno.pm module. The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to provide symbolic names for $! errno values.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Cannot find an opnumber for &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) A string of a form &quot;CORE::word&quot; was given to <i>prototype()</i>, but there is no builtin with the name &quot;word&quot;.</dd>

Character class syntax [. .] is reserved for future extensions</dt>

(W) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with &quot;[.&quot; and ending with &quot;.]&quot; is reserved for future extensions. If you need to represent those character sequences inside a regular expression character class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash: &quot;\[.&quot; and &quot;.\]&quot;.</dd>

<dt>
%s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular expression that contains the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width assertion, which is unsafe. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre, and perlsec.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s: Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval'</dt>
<dd>
(F) A regular expression contained the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width assertion, but that construct is only allowed when the &quot;use re 'eval'&quot; pragma is in effect.  See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
%s: Eval-group not allowed at run time</dt>
<dd>
(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist, you may still do this by explicitly building the pattern from an interpolated string at run time and using that in an  <i>eval()</i>. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)</dt>
<dd>
(W) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string.  This has the effect of blessing the reference into the package main.  This is usually not what you want.  Consider providing a default target package, e.g. bless($ref, $p || 'MyPackage');</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Illegal hex digit ignored</dt>
<dd>
(W) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or A - F in a hexadecimal number.  Interpretation of the hexadecimal number stopped before the illegal character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No such array field</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to access an array as a hash, but the field name used is not defined.  The hash at index 0 should map all valid field names to array indices for that to work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
No such field &quot;%s&quot; in variable %s of type %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) You tried to access a field of a typed variable where the type does not know about the field name.  The field names are looked up in the %FIELDS hash in the type package at compile time.  The %FIELDS hash is usually set up with the 'fields' pragma.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Out of memory during ridiculously large request</dt>
<dd>
(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes.  This error is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g., $arr[time] instead of $arr[$time].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Range iterator outside integer range</dt>
<dd>
(F) One (or both) of the numeric arguments to the range operator &quot;..&quot; are outside the range which can be represented by integers internally. One possible workaround is to force Perl to use magical string increment by prepending &quot;0&quot; to your numbers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Recursive inheritance detected while looking for method '%s' %s</dt>
<dd>
(F) More than 100 levels of inheritance were encountered while invoking a method.  Probably indicates an unintended loop in your inheritance hierarchy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Reference found where even-sized list expected</dt>
<dd>
(W) You gave a single reference where Perl was expecting a list with an even number of elements (for assignment to a hash). This usually means that you used the anon hash constructor when you meant to use parens. In any case, a hash requires key/value  <b>pairs</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    %hash = { one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, };   # WRONG<br/>
    %hash = [ qw/ an anon array / ];   # WRONG<br/>
    %hash = ( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, );   # right<br/>
    %hash = qw( one 1 two 2 );                 # also fine<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Undefined value assigned to typeglob</dt>
<dd>
(W) An undefined value was assigned to a typeglob, a la &quot;*foo = undef&quot;. This does nothing.  It's possible that you really mean &quot;undef *foo&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of reserved word &quot;%s&quot; is deprecated</dt>
<dd>
(D) The indicated bareword is a reserved word.  Future versions of perl may use it as a keyword, so you're better off either explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its context of use, or using a different name altogether.  The warning can be suppressed for subroutine names by either adding a &quot;&amp;&quot; prefix, or using a package qualifier, e.g. &quot;&amp;our()&quot;, or &quot;Foo::our()&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.</dt>
<dd>
(S) The whole warning message will look something like:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
       perl: warning: Setting locale failed.<br/>
       perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:<br/>
               LC_ALL = &quot;En_US&quot;,<br/>
               LANG = (unset)<br/>
           are supported and installed on your system.<br/>
       perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (&quot;C&quot;).<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies.  In the above the settings were that the LC_ALL was &quot;En_US&quot; and the LANG had no value. This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your system administrator have set up the so-called variable system but Perl could not use those settings.  This was not dead serious, fortunately: there is a &quot;default locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot; that Perl can and will use, the script will be run.  Before you really fix the problem, however, you will get the same error message each time you run Perl.  How to really fix the problem can be found in &quot;LOCALE PROBLEMS&quot; in perllocale.</dd>

regexp too big</dt>
<dd>
(F) The current implementation of regular expressions uses shorts as address offsets within a string.

Usually when you want a regular expression this big, there is a better way to do it with multiple statements.  See perlre.</dd>

<h1>Configuration Changes</h1> You can use &quot;Configure -Uinstallusrbinperl&quot; which causes installperl to skip installing perl also as /usr/bin/perl.
