<h1>NAME</h1> perl5120delta - what is new for perl v5.12.0</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.10.0 release and the 5.12.0 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Many of the bug fixes in 5.12.0 are already included in the 5.10.1 maintenance release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can see the list of those changes in the 5.10.1 release notes (perl5101delta).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>New &quot;package NAME VERSION&quot; syntax</h2> This new syntax allows a module author to set the $VERSION of a namespace when the namespace is declared with 'package'. It eliminates the need for &quot;our $VERSION = ...&quot; and similar constructs. E.g.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
      package Foo::Bar 1.23;<br/>
      # $Foo::Bar::VERSION == 1.23<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are several advantages to this:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
$VERSION is parsed in exactly the same way as &quot;use NAME VERSION&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
$VERSION is set at compile time</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
$VERSION is a version object that provides proper overloading of comparison operators so comparing $VERSION to decimal (1.23) or dotted-decimal (v1.2.3) version numbers works correctly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Eliminates &quot;$VERSION = ...&quot; and &quot;eval $VERSION&quot; clutter</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
As it requires VERSION to be a numeric literal or v-string literal, it can be statically parsed by toolchain modules without &quot;eval&quot; the way MM-&gt;parse_version does for &quot;$VERSION = ...&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It does not break old code with only &quot;package NAME&quot;, but code that uses &quot;package NAME VERSION&quot; will need to be restricted to perl 5.12.0 or newer This is analogous to the change to &quot;open&quot; from two-args to three-args. Users requiring the latest Perl will benefit, and perhaps after several years, it will become a standard practice.<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, &quot;package NAME VERSION&quot; requires a new, 'strict' version number format. See &quot;Version number formats&quot; for details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The &quot;...&quot; operator</h2> A new operator, &quot;...&quot;, nicknamed the Yada Yada operator, has been added. It is intended to mark placeholder code that is not yet implemented. See &quot;Yada Yada Operator&quot; in perlop.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Implicit strictures</h2> Using the &quot;use VERSION&quot; syntax with a version number greater or equal to 5.11.0 will lexically enable strictures just like &quot;use strict&quot; would do (in addition to enabling features.) The following:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use 5.12.0;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
means:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use strict;<br/>
    use feature ':5.12';<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode improvements</h2> Perl 5.12 comes with Unicode 5.2, the latest version available to us at the time of release.  This version of Unicode was released in October 2009. See &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0&gt; for further details about what's changed in this version of the standard. See perlunicode for instructions on installing and using other versions of Unicode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Additionally, Perl's developers have significantly improved Perl's Unicode implementation. For full details, see &quot;Unicode overhaul&quot; below.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Y2038 compliance</h2> Perl's core time-related functions are now Y2038 compliant. (It may not mean much to you, but your kids will love it!)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>qr overloading</h2> It is now possible to overload the &quot;qr//&quot; operator, that is, conversion to regexp, like it was already possible to overload conversion to boolean, string or number of objects. It is invoked when an object appears on the right hand side of the &quot;=~&quot; operator or when it is interpolated into a regexp. See overload.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Pluggable keywords</h2> Extension modules can now cleanly hook into the Perl parser to define new kinds of keyword-headed expression and compound statement. The syntax following the keyword is defined entirely by the extension. This allow a completely non-Perl sublanguage to be parsed inline, with the correct ops cleanly generated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;PL_keyword_plugin&quot; in perlapi for the mechanism. The Perl core source distribution also includes a new module XS::APItest::KeywordRPN, which implements reverse Polish notation arithmetic via pluggable keywords. This module is mainly used for test purposes, and is not normally installed, but also serves as an example of how to use the new mechanism.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl's developers consider this feature to be experimental. We may remove it or change it in a backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>APIs for more internals</h2> The lowest layers of the lexer and parts of the pad system now have C APIs available to XS extensions. These are necessary to support proper use of pluggable keywords, but have other uses too. The new APIs are experimental, and only cover a small proportion of what would be necessary to take full advantage of the core's facilities in these areas. It is intended that the Perl 5.13 development cycle will see the addition of a full range of clean, supported interfaces.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl's developers consider this feature to be experimental. We may remove it or change it in a backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Overridable function lookup</h2> Where an extension module hooks the creation of rv2cv ops to modify the subroutine lookup process, this now works correctly for bareword subroutine calls. This means that prototypes on subroutines referenced this way will be processed correctly. (Previously bareword subroutine names were initially looked up, for parsing purposes, by an unhookable mechanism, so extensions could only properly influence subroutine names that appeared with an &quot;&amp;&quot; sigil.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>A proper interface for pluggable Method Resolution Orders</h2> As of Perl 5.12.0 there is a new interface for plugging and using method resolution orders other than the default linear depth first search. The C3 method resolution order added in 5.10.0 has been re-implemented as a plugin, without changing its Perl-space interface. See perlmroapi for more information.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;\N&quot; experimental regex escape</h2> Perl now supports &quot;\N&quot;, a new regex escape which you can think of as the inverse of &quot;\n&quot;. It will match any character that is not a newline, independently from the presence or absence of the single line match modifier &quot;/s&quot;. It is not usable within a character class.  &quot;\N{3}&quot; means to match 3 non-newlines; &quot;\N{5,}&quot; means to match at least 5. &quot;\N{NAME}&quot; still means the character or sequence named &quot;NAME&quot;, but &quot;NAME&quot; no longer can be things like 3, or &quot;5,&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This will break a custom charnames translator which allows numbers for character names, as &quot;\N{3}&quot; will now mean to match 3 non-newline characters, and not the character whose name is 3. (No name defined by the Unicode standard is a number, so only custom translators might be affected.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl's developers are somewhat concerned about possible user confusion with the existing &quot;\N{...}&quot; construct which matches characters by their Unicode name. Consequently, this feature is experimental. We may remove it or change it in a backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>DTrace support</h2> Perl now has some support for DTrace. See &quot;DTrace support&quot; in  <i>INSTALL</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Support for &quot;configure_requires&quot; in CPAN module metadata</h2> Both &quot;CPAN&quot; and &quot;CPANPLUS&quot; now support the &quot;configure_requires&quot; keyword in the  <i>META.yml</i> metadata file included in most recent CPAN distributions.  This allows distribution authors to specify configuration prerequisites that must be installed before running  <i>Makefile.PL</i> or  <i>Build.PL</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the documentation for &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; or &quot;Module::Build&quot; for more on how to specify &quot;configure_requires&quot; when creating a distribution for CPAN.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;each&quot;, &quot;keys&quot;, &quot;values&quot; are now more flexible</h2> The &quot;each&quot;, &quot;keys&quot;, &quot;values&quot; function can now operate on arrays.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;when&quot; as a statement modifier</h2> &quot;when&quot; is now allowed to be used as a statement modifier.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>$, flexibility</h2> The variable $, may now be tied.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>// in when clauses</h2> // now behaves like || in when clauses</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Enabling warnings from your shell environment</h2> You can now set &quot;-W&quot; from the &quot;PERL5OPT&quot; environment variable</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;delete local&quot;</h2> &quot;delete local&quot; now allows you to locally delete a hash entry.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New support for Abstract namespace sockets</h2> Abstract namespace sockets are Linux-specific socket type that live in AF_UNIX family, slightly abusing it to be able to use arbitrary character arrays as addresses: They start with nul byte and are not terminated by nul byte, but with the length passed to the  <i>socket()</i> system call.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>32-bit limit on substr arguments removed</h2> The 32-bit limit on &quot;substr&quot; arguments has now been removed. The full range of the system's signed and unsigned integers is now available for the &quot;pos&quot; and &quot;len&quot; arguments.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Potentially Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Deprecations warn by default</h2> Over the years, Perl's developers have deprecated a number of language features for a variety of reasons.  Perl now defaults to issuing a warning if a deprecated language feature is used. Many of the deprecations Perl now warns you about have been deprecated for many years.  You can find a list of what was deprecated in a given release of Perl in the &quot;perl5xxdelta.pod&quot; file for that release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To disable this feature in a given lexical scope, you should use &quot;no warnings 'deprecated';&quot; For information about which language features are deprecated and explanations of various deprecation warnings, please see perldiag. See &quot;Deprecations&quot; below for the list of features and modules Perl's developers have deprecated as part of this release.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Version number formats</h2> Acceptable version number formats have been formalized into &quot;strict&quot; and &quot;lax&quot; rules. &quot;package NAME VERSION&quot; takes a strict version number. &quot;UNIVERSAL::VERSION&quot; and the version object constructors take lax version numbers. Providing an invalid version will result in a fatal error. The version argument in &quot;use NAME VERSION&quot; is first parsed as a numeric literal or v-string and then passed to &quot;UNIVERSAL::VERSION&quot; (and must then pass the &quot;lax&quot; format test).<div class="spacer">
</div>
These formats are documented fully in the version module. To a first approximation, a &quot;strict&quot; version number is a positive decimal number (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal v-string with a leading 'v' character and at least three components. A &quot;lax&quot; version number allows v-strings with fewer than three components or without a leading 'v'. Under &quot;lax&quot; rules, both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a trailing &quot;alpha&quot; component separated by an underscore character after a fractional or dotted-decimal component.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The version module adds &quot;version::is_strict&quot; and &quot;version::is_lax&quot; functions to check a scalar against these rules.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>@INC reorganization</h2> In @INC, &quot;ARCHLIB&quot; and &quot;PRIVLIB&quot; now occur after after the current version's &quot;site_perl&quot; and &quot;vendor_perl&quot;.  Modules installed into &quot;site_perl&quot; and &quot;vendor_perl&quot; will now be loaded in preference to those installed in &quot;ARCHLIB&quot; and &quot;PRIVLIB&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>REGEXPs are now first class</h2> Internally, Perl now treats compiled regular expressions (such as those created with &quot;qr//&quot;) as first class entities. Perl modules which serialize, deserialize or otherwise have deep interaction with Perl's internal data structures need to be updated for this change.  Most affected CPAN modules have already been updated as of this writing.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Switch statement changes</h2> The &quot;given&quot;/&quot;when&quot; switch statement handles complex statements better than Perl 5.10.0 did (These enhancements are also available in 5.10.1 and subsequent 5.10 releases.) There are two new cases where &quot;when&quot; now interprets its argument as a boolean, instead of an expression to be used in a smart match:<dl>
<dt>
flip-flop operators</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;..&quot; and &quot;...&quot; flip-flop operators are now evaluated in boolean context, following their usual semantics; see &quot;Range Operators&quot; in perlop.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that, as in perl 5.10.0, &quot;when (1..10)&quot; will not work to test whether a given value is an integer between 1 and 10; you should use &quot;when ([1..10])&quot; instead (note the array reference).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
However, contrary to 5.10.0, evaluating the flip-flop operators in boolean context ensures it can now be useful in a &quot;when()&quot;, notably for implementing bistable conditions, like in:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    when (/^=begin/ .. /^=end/) {<br/>
      # do something<br/>
    }<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
defined-or operator</dt>
<dd>
A compound expression involving the defined-or operator, as in &quot;when (expr1 // expr2)&quot;, will be treated as boolean if the first expression is boolean. (This just extends the existing rule that applies to the regular or operator, as in &quot;when (expr1 || expr2)&quot;.)</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Smart match changes</h2> Since Perl 5.10.0, Perl's developers have made a number of changes to the smart match operator. These, of course, also alter the behaviour of the switch statements where smart matching is implicitly used. These changes were also made for the 5.10.1 release, and will remain in subsequent 5.10 releases.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Changes to type-based dispatch</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The smart match operator &quot;~~&quot; is no longer commutative. The behaviour of a smart match now depends primarily on the type of its right hand argument. Moreover, its semantics have been adjusted for greater consistency or usefulness in several cases. While the general backwards compatibility is maintained, several changes must be noted:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Code references with an empty prototype are no longer treated specially. They are passed an argument like the other code references (even if they choose to ignore it).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;%hash ~~ sub {}&quot; and &quot;@array ~~ sub {}&quot; now test that the subroutine returns a true value for each key of the hash (or element of the array), instead of passing the whole hash or array as a reference to the subroutine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Due to the commutativity breakage, code references are no longer treated specially when appearing on the left of the &quot;~~&quot; operator, but like any vulgar scalar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;undef ~~ %hash&quot; is always false (since &quot;undef&quot; can't be a key in a hash). No implicit conversion to &quot;&quot; is done (as was the case in perl 5.10.0).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;$scalar ~~ @array&quot; now always distributes the smart match across the elements of the array. It's true if one element in @array verifies &quot;$scalar ~~ $element&quot;. This is a generalization of the old behaviour that tested whether the array contained the scalar.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The full dispatch table for the smart match operator is given in &quot;Smart matching in detail&quot; in perlsyn.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Smart match and overloading</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
According to the rule of dispatch based on the rightmost argument type, when an object overloading &quot;~~&quot; appears on the right side of the operator, the overload routine will always be called (with a 3rd argument set to a true value, see overload.) However, when the object will appear on the left, the overload routine will be called only when the rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way, distributivity of smart match across arrays is not broken, as well as the other behaviours with complex types (coderefs, hashes, regexes). Thus, writers of overloading routines for smart match mostly need to worry only with comparing against a scalar, and possibly with stringification overloading; the other common cases will be automatically handled consistently.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;~~&quot; will now refuse to work on objects that do not overload it (in order to avoid relying on the object's underlying structure). (However, if the object overloads the stringification or the numification operators, and if overload fallback is active, it will be used instead, as usual.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Other potentially incompatible changes</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The definitions of a number of Unicode properties have changed to match those of the current Unicode standard. These are listed above under &quot;Unicode overhaul&quot;. This change may break code that expects the old definitions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The boolkeys op has moved to the group of hash ops. This breaks binary compatibility.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Filehandles are now always blessed into &quot;IO::File&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The previous behaviour was to bless Filehandles into FileHandle (an empty proxy class) if it was loaded into memory and otherwise to bless them into &quot;IO::Handle&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The semantics of &quot;use feature :5.10*&quot; have changed slightly. See &quot;Modules and Pragmata&quot; for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl's developers now use git, rather than Perforce.  This should be a purely internal change only relevant to people actively working on the core.  However, you may see minor difference in perl as a consequence of the change.  For example in some of details of the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;. See perlrepository for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
As part of the &quot;Test::Harness&quot; 2.x to 3.x upgrade, the experimental &quot;Test::Harness::Straps&quot; module has been removed. See &quot;Modules and Pragmata&quot; for more details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
As part of the &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; upgrade, the &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::bytes&quot; and &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::vmsish&quot; modules have been removed from this distribution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;Module::CoreList&quot; no longer contains the %:patchlevel hash.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;length undef&quot; now returns undef.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Unsupported private C API functions are now declared &quot;static&quot; to prevent leakage to Perl's public API.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
To support the bootstrapping process, <i>miniperl</i> no longer builds with UTF-8 support in the regexp engine.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This allows a build to complete with PERL_UNICODE set and a UTF-8 locale. Without this there's a bootstrapping problem, as miniperl can't load the UTF-8 components of the regexp engine, because they're not yet built.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>miniperl</i>'s @INC is now restricted to just &quot;-I...&quot;, the split of $ENV{PERL5LIB}, and &quot;&quot;.&quot;&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A space or a newline is now required after a &quot;#line XXX&quot; directive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Tied filehandles now have an additional method EOF which provides the EOF type.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
To better match all other flow control statements, &quot;foreach&quot; may no longer be used as an attribute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl's command-line switch &quot;-P&quot;, which was deprecated in version 5.10.0, has now been removed. The CPAN module &quot;Filter::cpp&quot; can be used as an alternative.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Deprecations</h1> From time to time, Perl's developers find it necessary to deprecate features or modules we've previously shipped as part of the core distribution. We are well aware of the pain and frustration that a backwards-incompatible change to Perl can cause for developers building or maintaining software in Perl. You can be sure that when we deprecate a functionality or syntax, it isn't a choice we make lightly. Sometimes, we choose to deprecate functionality or syntax because it was found to be poorly designed or implemented. Sometimes, this is because they're holding back other features or causing performance problems. Sometimes, the reasons are more complex. Wherever possible, we try to keep deprecated functionality available to developers in its previous form for at least one major release. So long as a deprecated feature isn't actively disrupting our ability to maintain and extend Perl, we'll try to leave it in place as long as possible.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following items are now deprecated:<dl>
<dt>
suidperl</dt>
<dd>
&quot;suidperl&quot; is no longer part of Perl. It used to provide a mechanism to emulate setuid permission bits on systems that don't support it properly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of &quot;:=&quot; to mean an empty attribute list</dt>
<dd>
An accident of Perl's parser meant that these constructions were all equivalent:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $pi := 4;<br/>
    my $pi : = 4;<br/>
    my $pi :  = 4;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
with the &quot;:&quot; being treated as the start of an attribute list, which ends before the &quot;=&quot;. As whitespace is not significant here, all are parsed as an empty attribute list, hence all the above are equivalent to, and better written as<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $pi = 4;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
because no attribute processing is done for an empty list.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As is, this meant that &quot;:=&quot; cannot be used as a new token, without silently changing the meaning of existing code. Hence that particular form is now deprecated, and will become a syntax error. If it is absolutely necessary to have empty attribute lists (for example, because of a code generator) then avoid the warning by adding a space before the &quot;=&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;UNIVERSAL-&gt;import()&quot;</dt>
<dd>
The method &quot;UNIVERSAL-&gt;import()&quot; is now deprecated. Attempting to pass import arguments to a &quot;use UNIVERSAL&quot; statement will result in a deprecation warning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Use of &quot;goto&quot; to jump into a construct</dt>
<dd>
Using &quot;goto&quot; to jump from an outer scope into an inner scope is now deprecated. This rare use case was causing problems in the implementation of scopes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Custom character names in \N{name} that don't look like names</dt>
<dd>
In &quot;\N{<i>name</i>}&quot;, <i>name</i> can be just about anything. The standard Unicode names have a very limited domain, but a custom name translator could create names that are, for example, made up entirely of punctuation symbols. It is now deprecated to make names that don't begin with an alphabetic character, and aren't alphanumeric or contain other than a very few other characters, namely spaces, dashes, parentheses and colons. Because of the added meaning of &quot;\N&quot; (See &quot;&quot;\N&quot; experimental regex escape&quot;), names that look like curly brace -enclosed quantifiers won't work. For example, &quot;\N{3,4}&quot; now means to match 3 to 4 non-newlines; before a custom name &quot;3,4&quot; could have been created.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Deprecated Modules</dt>
<dd>
The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a future release, and should be installed from CPAN instead. Distributions on CPAN which require these should add them to their prerequisites. The core versions of these modules warnings will issue a deprecation warning.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you ship a packaged version of Perl, either alone or as part of a larger system, then you should carefully consider the repercussions of core module deprecations. You may want to consider shipping your default build of Perl with packages for some or all deprecated modules which install into &quot;vendor&quot; or &quot;site&quot; perl library directories. This will inhibit the deprecation warnings.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Alternatively, you may want to consider patching <i>lib/deprecate.pm</i> to provide deprecation warnings specific to your packaging system or distribution of Perl, consistent with how your packaging system or distribution manages a staged transition from a release where the installation of a single package provides the given functionality, to a later release where the system administrator needs to know to install multiple packages to get that same functionality.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can silence these deprecation warnings by installing the modules in question from CPAN.  To install the latest version of all of them, just install &quot;Task::Deprecations::5_12&quot;.</dd>

Although listed as part of the API, it was never documented, and only ever used in  <i>toke.c</i>, and prior to 5.10, <i>regcomp.c</i>. In core, it has been replaced by a static function.</dd>

&#160;</div>
During final testing before the release of 5.12.0, several developers discovered current production code using these ancient libraries, some inside the Perl core itself.  Accordingly, the pumpking granted them a stay of execution. They will begin to warn about their deprecation in the 5.14.0 release and will be removed in the 5.16.0 release.</dd>

<div class="section">
<h1>Unicode overhaul</h1> Perl's developers have made a concerted effort to update Perl to be in sync with the latest Unicode standard. Changes for this include:<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl can now handle every Unicode character property. New documentation, perluniprops, lists all available non-Unihan character properties. By default, perl does not expose Unihan, deprecated or Unicode-internal properties.  See below for more details on these; there is also a section in the pod listing them, and explaining why they are not exposed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl now fully supports the Unicode compound-style of using &quot;=&quot; and &quot;:&quot; in writing regular expressions: &quot;\p{property=value}&quot; and &quot;\p{property:value}&quot; (both of which mean the same thing).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl now fully supports the Unicode loose matching rules for text between the braces in &quot;\p{...}&quot; constructs. In addition, Perl allows underscores between digits of numbers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl now accepts all the Unicode-defined synonyms for properties and property values.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;qr/\X/&quot;, which matches a Unicode logical character, has been expanded to work better with various Asian languages. It now is defined as an  <i>extended grapheme cluster</i>. (See &lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/&gt;).  Anything matched previously and that made sense will continue to be accepted.   Additionally:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\X&quot; will not break apart a &quot;CR&#160;LF&quot; sequence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\X&quot; will now match a sequence which includes the &quot;ZWJ&quot; and &quot;ZWNJ&quot; characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\X&quot; will now always match at least one character, including an initial mark.  Marks generally come after a base character, but it is possible in Unicode to have them in isolation, and &quot;\X&quot; will now handle that case, for example at the beginning of a line, or after a &quot;ZWSP&quot;. And this is the part where &quot;\X&quot; doesn't match the things that it used to that don't make sense. Formerly, for example, you could have the nonsensical case of an accented LF.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\X&quot; will now match a (Korean) Hangul syllable sequence, and the Thai and Lao exception cases.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Otherwise, this change should be transparent for the non-affected languages.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{...}&quot; matches using the Canonical_Combining_Class property were completely broken in previous releases of Perl.  They should now work correctly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Before Perl 5.12, the Unicode &quot;Decomposition_Type=Compat&quot; property and a Perl extension had the same name, which led to neither matching all the correct values (with more than 100 mistakes in one, and several thousand in the other). The Perl extension has now been renamed to be &quot;Decomposition_Type=Noncanonical&quot; (short: &quot;dt=noncanon&quot;). It has the same meaning as was previously intended, namely the union of all the non-canonical Decomposition types, with Unicode &quot;Compat&quot; being just one of those.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Decomposition_Type=Canonical}&quot; now includes the Hangul syllables.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Uppercase}&quot; and &quot;\p{Lowercase}&quot; now work as the Unicode standard says they should.  This means they each match a few more characters than they used to.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Cntrl}&quot; now matches the same characters as &quot;\p{Control}&quot;. This means it no longer will match Private Use (gc=co), Surrogates (gc=cs), nor Format (gc=cf) code points. The Format code points represent the biggest possible problem. All but 36 of them are either officially deprecated or strongly discouraged from being used. Of those 36, likely the most widely used are the soft hyphen (U+00AD), and BOM, ZWSP, ZWNJ, WJ, and similar characters, plus bidirectional controls.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Alpha}&quot; now matches the same characters as &quot;\p{Alphabetic}&quot;. Before 5.12, Perl's definition definition included a number of things that aren't really alpha (all marks) while omitting many that were. The definitions of &quot;\p{Alnum}&quot; and &quot;\p{Word}&quot; depend on Alpha's definition and have changed accordingly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Word}&quot; no longer incorrectly matches non-word characters such as fractions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Print}&quot; no longer matches the line control characters: Tab, LF, CR, FF, VT, and NEL. This brings it in line with standards and the documentation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{XDigit}&quot; now matches the same characters as &quot;\p{Hex_Digit}&quot;. This means that in addition to the characters it currently matches, &quot;[A-Fa-f0-9]&quot;, it will also match the 22 fullwidth equivalents, for example U+FF10: FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Numeric type property has been extended to include the Unihan characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is a new Perl extension, the 'Present_In', or simply 'In', property. This is an extension of the Unicode Age property, but &quot;\p{In=5.0}&quot; matches any code point whose usage has been determined  <i>as of</i> Unicode version 5.0. The &quot;\p{Age=5.0}&quot; only matches code points added in  <i>precisely</i> version 5.0.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A number of properties now have the correct values for unassigned code points. The affected properties are Bidi_Class, East_Asian_Width, Joining_Type, Decomposition_Type, Hangul_Syllable_Type, Numeric_Type, and Line_Break.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, ID_Continue, and ID_Start properties are now up to date with current Unicode definitions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Earlier versions of Perl erroneously exposed certain properties that are supposed to be Unicode internal-only.  Use of these in regular expressions will now generate, if enabled, a deprecation warning message. The properties are: Other_Alphabetic, Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, Other_Grapheme_Extend, Other_ID_Continue, Other_ID_Start, Other_Lowercase, Other_Math, and Other_Uppercase.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is now possible to change which Unicode properties Perl understands on a per-installation basis. As mentioned above, certain properties are turned off by default.  These include all the Unihan properties (which should be accessible via the CPAN module Unicode::Unihan) and any deprecated or Unicode internal-only property that Perl has never exposed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The generated files in the &quot;lib/unicore/To&quot; directory are now more clearly marked as being stable, directly usable by applications.  New hash entries in them give the format of the normal entries, which allows for easier machine parsing. Perl can generate files in this directory for any property, though most are suppressed.  You can find instructions for changing which are written in perluniprops.</div>

&quot;feature&quot;</dt>

In &quot;feature&quot;, the meaning of the &quot;:5.10&quot; and &quot;:5.10.X&quot; feature bundles has changed slightly. The last component, if any (i.e. &quot;X&quot;) is simply ignored.  This is predicated on the assumption that new features will not, in general, be added to maintenance releases. So &quot;:5.10&quot; and &quot;:5.10.X&quot; have identical effect. This is a change to the behaviour documented for 5.10.0.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h2>Changes to Existing Documentation</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The various large <i>Changes*</i> files (which listed every change made to perl over the last 18 years) have been removed, and replaced by a small file, also called  <i>Changes</i>, which just explains how that same information may be extracted from the git version control system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>Porting/patching.pod</i> has been deleted, as it mainly described interacting with the old Perforce-based repository, which is now obsolete. Information still relevant has been moved to perlrepository.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The syntax &quot;unless (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK&quot; is now documented as valid, as is the syntax &quot;unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK&quot;, although actually using the latter may not be the best idea for the readability of your source code.</dd>

<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Correct previous documentation: v-strings are not deprecated<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dd>
A significant fraction of the core documentation has been updated to clarify the behavior of Perl's Unicode handling.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Much of the remaining core documentation has been reviewed and edited for clarity, consistent use of language, and to fix the spelling of Tom Christiansen's name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The Pod specification (perlpodspec) has been updated to bring the specification in line with modern usage already supported by most Pod systems. A parameter string may now follow the format name in a &quot;begin/end&quot; region. Links to URIs with a text description are now allowed.

<h1>Selected Performance Enhancements</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A new internal cache means that &quot;isa()&quot; will often be faster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The implementation of &quot;C3&quot; Method Resolution Order has been optimised - linearisation for classes with single inheritance is 40% faster. Performance for multiple inheritance is unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Under &quot;use locale&quot;, the locale-relevant information is now cached on read-only values, such as the list returned by &quot;keys %hash&quot;. This makes operations such as &quot;sort keys %hash&quot; in the scope of &quot;use locale&quot; much faster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Empty &quot;DESTROY&quot; methods are no longer called.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;Perl_sv_utf8_upgrade()&quot; is now faster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;keys&quot; on empty hash is now faster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;if (%foo)&quot; has been optimized to be faster than &quot;if (keys %foo)&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The string repetition operator (&quot;$str x $num&quot;) is now several times faster when $str has length one or $num is large.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Reversing an array to itself (as in &quot;@a = reverse @a&quot;) in void context now happens in-place and is several orders of magnitude faster than it used to be. It will also preserve non-existent elements whenever possible, i.e. for non magical arrays or tied arrays with &quot;EXISTS&quot; and &quot;DELETE&quot; methods.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Installation and Configuration Improvements</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
perlapi, perlintern, perlmodlib and perltoc are now all generated at build time, rather than being shipped as part of the release.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
If &quot;vendorlib&quot; and &quot;vendorarch&quot; are the same, then they are only added to @INC once.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
$Config{usedevel} and the C-level &quot;PERL_USE_DEVEL&quot; are now defined if perl is built with  &quot;-Dusedevel&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>Configure</i> will enable use of &quot;-fstack-protector&quot;, to provide protection against stack-smashing attacks, if the compiler supports it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>Configure</i> will now determine the correct prototypes for re-entrant functions and for &quot;gconvert&quot; if you are using a C++ compiler rather than a C compiler.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
On Unix, if you build from a tree containing a git repository, the configuration process will note the commit hash you have checked out, for display in the output of &quot;perl -v&quot; and &quot;perl -V&quot;. Unpushed local commits are automatically added to the list of local patches displayed by &quot;perl -V&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl now supports SystemTap's &quot;dtrace&quot; compatibility layer and an issue with linking &quot;miniperl&quot; has been fixed in the process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
perldoc now uses &quot;less -R&quot; instead of &quot;less&quot; for improved behaviour in the face of &quot;groff&quot;'s new usage of ANSI escape codes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;perl -V&quot; now reports use of the compile-time options &quot;USE_PERL_ATOF&quot; and &quot;USE_ATTRIBUTES_FOR_PERLIO&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
As part of the flattening of <i>ext</i>, all extensions on all platforms are built by  <i>make_ext.pl</i>. This replaces the Unix-specific  <i>ext/util/make_ext</i>, VMS-specific <i>make_ext.com</i> and Win32-specific  <i>win32/buildext.pl</i>.</dd>

<h1>Internal Changes</h1> Each release of Perl sees numerous internal changes which shouldn't affect day to day usage but may still be notable for developers working with Perl's source code.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The J.R.R. Tolkien quotes at the head of C source file have been checked and proper citations added, thanks to a patch from Tom Christiansen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The internal structure of the dual-life modules traditionally found in the  <i>lib/</i> and <i>ext/</i> directories in the perl source has changed significantly. Where possible, dual-lifed modules have been extracted from  <i>lib/</i> and <i>ext/</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Dual-lifed modules maintained by Perl's developers as part of the Perl core now live in  <i>dist/</i>.  Dual-lifed modules maintained primarily on CPAN now live in  <i>cpan/</i>.  When reporting a bug in a module located under  <i>cpan/</i>, please send your bug report directly to the module's bug tracker or author, rather than Perl's bug tracker.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\N{...}&quot; now compiles better, always forces UTF-8 internal representation<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl's developers have fixed several problems with the recognition of &quot;\N{...}&quot; constructs.  As part of this, perl will store any scalar or regex containing &quot;\N{ <i>name</i>}&quot; or &quot;\N{U+<i>code point</i>}&quot; in its definition in UTF-8 format. (This was true previously for all occurrences of &quot;\N{ <i>name</i>}&quot; that did not use a custom translator, but now it's always true.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl_magic_setmglob now knows about globs, fixing RT #71254.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;SVt_RV&quot; no longer exists. RVs are now stored in IVs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;Perl_vcroak()&quot; now accepts a null first argument. In addition, a full audit was made of the &quot;not NULL&quot; compiler annotations, and those for several other internal functions were corrected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
New macros &quot;dSAVEDERRNO&quot;, &quot;dSAVE_ERRNO&quot;, &quot;SAVE_ERRNO&quot;, &quot;RESTORE_ERRNO&quot; have been added to formalise the temporary saving of the &quot;errno&quot; variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The function &quot;Perl_sv_insert_flags&quot; has been added to augment &quot;Perl_sv_insert&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The function &quot;Perl_newSV_type(type)&quot; has been added, equivalent to &quot;Perl_newSV()&quot; followed by &quot;Perl_sv_upgrade(type)&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The function &quot;Perl_newSVpvn_flags()&quot; has been added, equivalent to &quot;Perl_newSVpvn()&quot; and then performing the action relevant to the flag.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Two flag bits are currently supported.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;SVf_UTF8&quot; will call &quot;SvUTF8_on()&quot; for you. (Note that this does not convert an sequence of ISO 8859-1 characters to UTF-8). A wrapper, &quot;newSVpvn_utf8()&quot; is available for this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;SVs_TEMP&quot; now calls &quot;Perl_sv_2mortal()&quot; on the new SV.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There is also a wrapper that takes constant strings, &quot;newSVpvs_flags()&quot;.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The function &quot;Perl_croak_xs_usage&quot; has been added as a wrapper to &quot;Perl_croak&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl now exports the functions &quot;PerlIO_find_layer&quot; and &quot;PerlIO_list_alloc&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;PL_na&quot; has been exterminated from the core code, replaced by local STRLEN temporaries, or &quot;*_nolen()&quot; calls. Either approach is faster than &quot;PL_na&quot;, which is a pointer dereference into the interpreter structure under ithreads, and a global variable otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;Perl_mg_free()&quot; used to leave freed memory accessible via &quot;SvMAGIC()&quot; on the scalar. It now updates the linked list to remove each piece of magic as it is freed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Under ithreads, the regex in &quot;PL_reg_curpm&quot; is now reference counted. This eliminates a lot of hackish workarounds to cope with it not being reference counted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;Perl_mg_magical()&quot; would sometimes incorrectly turn on &quot;SvRMAGICAL()&quot;. This has been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The <i>public</i> IV and NV flags are now not set if the string value has trailing &quot;garbage&quot;. This behaviour is consistent with not setting the public IV or NV flags if the value is out of range for the type.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Uses of &quot;Nullav&quot;, &quot;Nullcv&quot;, &quot;Nullhv&quot;, &quot;Nullop&quot;, &quot;Nullsv&quot; etc have been replaced by &quot;NULL&quot; in the core code, and non-dual-life modules, as &quot;NULL&quot; is clearer to those unfamiliar with the core code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A macro MUTABLE_PTR(p) has been added, which on (non-pedantic) gcc will not cast away &quot;const&quot;, returning a &quot;void *&quot;. Macros &quot;MUTABLE_SV(av)&quot;, &quot;MUTABLE_SV(cv)&quot; etc build on this, casting to &quot;AV *&quot; etc without casting away &quot;const&quot;. This allows proper compile-time auditing of &quot;const&quot; correctness in the core, and helped picked up some errors (now fixed).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Macros &quot;mPUSHs()&quot; and &quot;mXPUSHs()&quot; have been added, for pushing SVs on the stack and mortalizing them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Use of the private structure &quot;mro_meta&quot; has changed slightly. Nothing outside the core should be accessing this directly anyway.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A new tool, <i>Porting/expand-macro.pl</i> has been added, that allows you to view how a C preprocessor macro would be expanded when compiled. This is handy when trying to decode the macro hell that is the perl guts.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">

Parallel tests</dt>
<dd>
The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on Unix-like platforms. Instead of running &quot;make test&quot;, set &quot;TEST_JOBS&quot; in your environment to the number of tests to run in parallel, and run &quot;make test_harness&quot;. On a Bourne-like shell, this can be done as<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<br/>
    TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness  # Run 3 tests in parallel<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An environment variable is used, rather than parallel make itself, because TAP::Harness needs to be able to schedule individual non-conflicting test scripts itself, and there is no standard interface to &quot;make&quot; utilities to interact with their job schedulers.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that currently some test scripts may fail when run in parallel (most notably &quot;ext/IO/t/io_dir.t&quot;). If necessary run just the failing scripts again sequentially and see if the failures go away.</dd>

&#160;</div>

&#160;</div>
<br/>
  no warnings 'illegalproto';<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dd>
&quot;Deep recursion on subroutine &quot;%s&quot;&quot;<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It is now possible to change the depth threshold for this warning from the default of 100, by recompiling the  <i>perl</i> binary, setting the C pre-processor macro &quot;PERL_SUB_DEPTH_WARN&quot; to the desired value.</dd>

Currently, all but the first of the several characters that the &quot;charnames&quot; handler may return are discarded when used in a regular expression pattern bracketed character class.

The warning &quot;Missing right brace on \N{} or unescaped left brace after \N.  Assuming the latter&quot; will be issued if Perl encounters a &quot;\N{&quot; but doesn't find a matching &quot;}&quot;. In this case Perl doesn't know if it was mistakenly omitted, or if &quot;match non-newline&quot; followed by &quot;match a &quot;{&quot;&quot; was desired.  It assumes the latter because that is actually a valid interpretation as written, unlike the other case.  If you meant the former, you need to add the matching right brace.  If you did mean the latter, you can silence this warning by writing instead &quot;\N\{&quot;.</dd>

pp_qr now always returns a new regexp SV. Resolves RT #69852.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Instead of returning a(nother) reference to the (pre-compiled) regexp in the optree, use  <i>reg_temp_copy()</i> to create a copy of it, and return a reference to that. This resolves issues about Regexp::DESTROY not being called in a timely fashion (the original bug tracked by RT #69852), as well as bugs related to blessing regexps, and of assigning to regexps, as described in correspondence added to the ticket.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It transpires that we also need to undo the <i>SvPVX()</i> sharing when ithreads cloning a Regexp SV, because mother_re is set to NULL, instead of a cloned copy of the mother_re. This change might fix bugs with regexps and threads in certain other situations, but as yet neither tests nor bug reports have indicated any problems, so it might not actually be an edge case that it's possible to reach.</dd>

&quot;kill&quot; is now fatal when called on non-numeric process identifiers. Previously, an &quot;undef&quot; process identifier would be interpreted as a request to kill process 0, which would terminate the current process group on POSIX systems.

5.10.0 inadvertently disabled an optimisation, which caused a measurable performance drop in list assignment, such as is often used to assign function parameters from @_. The optimisation has been re-instated, and the performance regression fixed. (This fix is also present in 5.10.1)</dd>

In 5.10.0, the &quot;*&quot; quantifier in patterns was sometimes treated as &quot;{0,32767}&quot; [RT #60034, #60464]. For example, this match would fail:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In &quot;unpack&quot;, the use of &quot;()&quot; groups in scalar context was internally placing a list on the interpreter's stack, which manifested in various ways, including SEGVs. This is now fixed [RT #50256].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Magic was called twice in &quot;substr&quot;, &quot;\&amp;$x&quot;, &quot;tie $x, $m&quot; and &quot;chop&quot;. These have all been fixed.</dd>

A 5.10.0 optimisation to clear the temporary stack within the implicit loop of &quot;s///ge&quot; has been reverted, as it turned out to be the cause of obscure bugs in seemingly unrelated parts of the interpreter [commit ef0d4e17921ee3de].</dd>

<h1>Platform Specific Changes</h1> Perl is incredibly portable. In general, if a platform has a C compiler, someone has ported Perl to it (or will soon).

<dd>
<i>perl.exe</i> now includes a manifest resource to specify the &quot;trustInfo&quot; settings for Windows Vista and later. Without this setting Windows would treat  <i>perl.exe</i> as a legacy application and apply various heuristics like redirecting access to protected file system areas (like the &quot;Program Files&quot; folder) to the users &quot;VirtualStore&quot; instead of generating a proper &quot;permission denied&quot; error.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The manifest resource also requests the Microsoft Common-Controls version 6.0 (themed controls introduced in Windows XP).  Check out the Win32::VisualStyles module on CPAN to switch back to old style unthemed controls for legacy applications.</dd>

The &quot;-t&quot; filetest operator now only returns true if the filehandle is connected to a console window.  In previous versions of Perl it would return true for all character mode devices, including  <i>NUL</i> and  <i>LPT1</i>.</dd>

The &quot;-p&quot; filetest operator now works correctly, and the Fcntl::S_IFIFO constant is defined when Perl is compiled with Microsoft Visual C.  In previous Perl versions &quot;-p&quot; always returned a false value, and the Fcntl::S_IFIFO constant was not defined.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

This bug is specific to Microsoft Visual C and never affected Perl binaries built with MinGW.</dd>

The socket error codes are now more widely supported:  The POSIX module will define the symbolic names, like POSIX::EWOULDBLOCK, and stringification of socket error codes in $! works as well now;<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<br/>
  C:\&gt;perl -MPOSIX -E &quot;$!=POSIX::EWOULDBLOCK; say $!&quot;<br/>
  A non-blocking socket operation could not be completed immediately.<br/>

<h1>Known Problems</h1> This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions from either 5.10.x or 5.8.x.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Some CPANPLUS tests may fail if there is a functioning file  <i>../../cpanp-run-perl</i> outside your build directory. The failure shouldn't imply there's a problem with the actual functional software. The bug is already fixed in [RT #74188] and is scheduled for inclusion in perl-v5.12.1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;List::Util::first&quot; misbehaves in the presence of a lexical $_ (typically introduced by &quot;my $_&quot; or implicitly by &quot;given&quot;). The variable which gets set for each iteration is the package variable $_, not the lexical $_ [RT #67694].<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A similar issue may occur in other modules that provide functions which take a block as their first argument, like<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    foo { ... $_ ...} list<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Some regexes may run much more slowly when run in a child thread compared with the thread the pattern was compiled into [RT #55600].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Things like &quot;&quot;\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FF}&quot; =~ /\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER F}+/&quot; will appear to hang as they get into a very long running loop [RT #72998].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Several porters have reported mysterious crashes when Perl's entire test suite is run after a build on certain Windows 2000 systems. When run by hand, the individual tests reportedly work fine.</dd>

<h1>Errata</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
This one is actually a change introduced in 5.10.0, but it was missed from that release's perldelta, so it is mentioned here instead.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A bugfix related to the handling of the &quot;/m&quot; modifier and &quot;qr&quot; resulted in a change of behaviour between 5.8.x and 5.10.0:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    # matches in 5.8.x, doesn't match in 5.10.0<br/>
    $re = qr/^bar/; &quot;foo\nbar&quot; =~ /$re/m;<br/>

This is woefully incomplete as it's automatically generated from version control history.  In particular, it doesn't include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues in previous versions of Perl that helped make Perl 5.12.0 better. For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the &quot;AUTHORS&quot; file in the Perl 5.12.0 distribution.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Our &quot;retired&quot; pumpkings Nicholas Clark and Rafael Garcia-Suarez deserve special thanks for their brilliant and substantive ongoing contributions. Nicholas personally authored over 30% of the patches since 5.10.0. Rafael comes in second in patch authorship with 11%, but is first by a long shot in committing patches authored by others, pushing 44% of the commits since 5.10.0 in this category, often after providing considerable coaching to the patch authors. These statistics in no way comprise all of their contributions, but express in shorthand that we couldn't have done it without them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.</div>

<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at &lt;http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/&gt;. There may also be information at &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt;, the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analyzed by the Perl porting team.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</div>
