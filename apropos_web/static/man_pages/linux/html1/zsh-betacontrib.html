<h1>NAME</h1> zsh-betacontrib - user contributions to zsh</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The Zsh source distribution includes a number of items contributed by the user community.  These are not inherently a part of the shell, and some may not be available in every zsh installation.  The most significant of these are documented here.  For documentation on other contributed items such as shell functions, look for comments in the function source files.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>UTILITIES</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Accessing On-Line Help</h2> The key sequence  <b>ESC h</b> is normally bound by ZLE to execute the  <b>run-help</b> widget (see  <i>zsh-betazle</i>(1)).  This invokes the <b>run-help</b> command with the command word from the current input line as its argument.  By default,  <b>run-help</b> is an alias for the  <b>man</b> command, so this often fails when the command word is a shell builtin or a user-defined function.  By redefining the  <b>run-help</b> alias, one can improve the on-line help provided by the shell.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>helpfiles</b> utility, found in the <b>Util</b> directory of the distribution, is a Perl program that can be used to process the zsh manual to produce a separate help file for each shell builtin and for many other shell features as well.  The autoloadable  <b>run-help</b> function, found in  <b>Functions/Misc</b>, searches for these helpfiles and performs several other tests to produce the most complete help possible for the command.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There may already be a directory of help files on your system; look in  <b>/usr/share/zsh</b> or <b>/usr/local/share/zsh</b> and subdirectories below those, or ask your system administrator.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To create your own help files with <b>helpfiles</b>, choose or create a directory where the individual command help files will reside.  For example, you might choose  <b>~/zsh_help</b>.  If you unpacked the zsh distribution in your home directory, you would use the commands:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>mkdir ~/zsh_help</b><br/>
<b>cd ~/zsh_help</b><br/>
<b>man zsh-betaall | colcrt - | \ </b><br/>
<b>perl ~/zsh-4.3.12-dev-1-cvs/Util/helpfiles</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Next, to use the <b>run-help</b> function, you need to add lines something like the following to your  <b>.zshrc</b> or equivalent startup file:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>unalias run-help</b><br/>
<b>autoload run-help</b><br/>
<b>HELPDIR=~/zsh_help</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>HELPDIR</b> parameter tells <b>run-help</b> where to look for the help files.  If your system already has a help file directory installed, set  <b>HELPDIR</b> to the path of that directory instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that in order for `<b>autoload run-help</b>' to work, the <b>run-help</b> file must be in one of the directories named in your  <b>fpath</b> array (see  <i>zsh-betaparam</i>(1)).  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh installation; if it is not, copy  <b>Functions/Misc/run-help</b> to an appropriate directory.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Recompiling Functions</h2> If you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your zsh installation to track the latest developments, you may find that function digests compiled with the  <b>zcompile</b> builtin are frequently out of date with respect to the function source files.  This is not usually a problem, because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a function, but it may cause slower shell startup and function loading.  Also, if a digest file is explicitly used as an element of  <b>fpath</b>, zsh won't check whether any of its source files has changed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>zrecompile</b> autoloadable function, found in <b>Functions/Misc</b>, can be used to keep function digests up to date.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>zrecompile</b> [ <b>-qt</b> ] [ <i>name</i> ... ]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>zrecompile</b> [ <b>-qt</b> ] <b>-p</b> <i>args</i> [ <b>-</b><b>-</b> <i>args</i> ... ] This tries to find  <b>*.zwc</b> files and automatically re-compile them if at least one of the original files is newer than the compiled file.  This works only if the names stored in the compiled files are full paths or are relative to the directory that contains the  <b>.zwc</b> file.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the first form, each <i>name</i> is the name of a compiled file or a directory containing  <b>*.zwc</b> files that should be checked.  If no arguments are given, the directories and  <b>*.zwc</b> files in <b>fpath</b> are used.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <b>-t</b> is given, no compilation is performed, but a return status of zero (true) is set if there are files that need to be re-compiled and non-zero (false) otherwise.  The  <b>-q</b> option quiets the chatty output that describes what  <b>zrecompile</b> is doing.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Without the <b>-t</b> option, the return status is zero if all files that needed re-compilation could be compiled and non-zero if compilation for at least one of the files failed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <b>-p</b> option is given, the <i>args</i> are interpreted as one or more sets of arguments for  <b>zcompile</b>, separated by `<b>-</b><b>-</b>'. For example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zrecompile -p \ </b><br/>
<b>           -R ~/.zshrc -- \ </b><br/>
<b>           -M ~/.zcompdump -- \ </b><br/>
<b>           ~/zsh/comp.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This compiles <b>~/.zshrc</b> into <b>~/.zshrc.zwc</b> if that doesn't exist or if it is older than  <b>~/.zshrc</b>. The compiled file will be marked for reading instead of mapping. The same is done for  <b>~/.zcompdump</b> and  <b>~/.zcompdump.zwc</b>, but this compiled file is marked for mapping. The last line re-creates the file  <b>~/zsh/comp.zwc</b> if any of the files matching the given pattern is newer than it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Without the <b>-p</b> option, <b>zrecompile</b> does not create function digests that do not already exist, nor does it add new functions to the digest.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following shell loop is an example of a method for creating function digests for all functions in your  <b>fpath</b>, assuming that you have write permission to the directories:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>for ((i=1; i &lt;= $#fpath; ++i)); do</b><br/>
<b>  dir=$fpath[i]</b><br/>
<b>  zwc=${dir:t}.zwc</b><br/>
<b>  if [[ $dir == (.|..) || $dir == (.|..)/* ]]; then</b><br/>
<b>    continue</b><br/>
<b>  fi</b><br/>
<b>  files=($dir/*(N-.))</b><br/>
<b>  if [[ -w $dir:h &amp;&amp; -n $files ]]; then</b><br/>
<b>    files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})</b><br/>
<b>    if ( cd $dir:h &amp;&amp;</b><br/>
<b>         zrecompile -p -U -z $zwc $files ); then</b><br/>
<b>      fpath[i]=$fpath[i].zwc</b><br/>
<b>    fi</b><br/>
<b>  fi</b><br/>
<b>done</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-U</b> and <b>-z</b> options are appropriate for functions in the default zsh installation  <b>fpath</b>; you may need to use different options for your personal function directories.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Once the digests have been created and your <b>fpath</b> modified to refer to them, you can keep them up to date by running  <b>zrecompile</b> with no arguments.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Keyboard Definition</h2> The large number of possible combinations of keyboards, workstations, terminals, emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to have built-in key bindings for every situation.  The  <b>zkbd</b> utility, found in Functions/Misc, can help you quickly create key bindings for your configuration.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Run <b>zkbd</b> either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell script:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zsh -f ~/zsh-4.3.12-dev-1-cvs/Functions/Misc/zkbd</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When you run <b>zkbd</b>, it first asks you to enter your terminal type; if the default it offers is correct, just press return.  It then asks you to press a number of different keys to determine characteristics of your keyboard and terminal;  <b>zkbd</b> warns you if it finds anything out of the ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither  <b>^H</b> nor <b>^?</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The keystrokes read by <b>zkbd</b> are recorded as a definition for an associative array named  <b>key</b>, written to a file in the subdirectory  <b>.zkbd</b> within either your <b>HOME</b> or <b>ZDOTDIR</b> directory.  The name of the file is composed from the  <b>TERM</b>, <b>VENDOR</b> and <b>OSTYPE</b> parameters, joined by hyphens.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may read this file into your <b>.zshrc</b> or another startup file with the ` <b>source</b>' or `<b>.</b>' commands, then reference the <b>key</b> parameter in bindkey commands, like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>source ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zkbd/$TERM-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE</b><br/>
<b>[[ -n ${key[Left]} ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey &quot;${key[Left]}&quot; backward-char</b><br/>
<b>[[ -n ${key[Right]} ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey &quot;${key[Right]}&quot; forward-char</b><br/>
<b># etc.</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that in order for `<b>autoload zkbd</b>' to work, the <b>zkdb</b> file must be in one of the directories named in your  <b>fpath</b> array (see  <i>zsh-betaparam</i>(1)).  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh installation; if it is not, copy  <b>Functions/Misc/zkbd</b> to an appropriate directory.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Dumping Shell State</h2> Occasionally you may encounter what appears to be a bug in the shell, particularly if you are using a beta version of zsh or a development release.  Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the problem to one of the zsh mailing lists (see  <i>zsh</i>(1)), but sometimes one of the zsh developers will need to recreate your environment in order to track the problem down.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The script named <b>reporter</b>, found in the <b>Util</b> directory of the distribution, is provided for this purpose.  (It is also possible to  <b>autoload reporter</b>, but <b>reporter</b> is not installed in <b>fpath</b> by default.)  This script outputs a detailed dump of the shell state, in the form of another script that can be read with ` <b>zsh -f</b>' to recreate that state.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To use <b>reporter</b>, read the script into your shell with the `<b>.</b>' command and redirect the output into a file:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>. ~/zsh-4.3.12-dev-1-cvs/Util/reporter &gt; zsh.report</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You should check the <b>zsh.report</b> file for any sensitive information such as passwords and delete them by hand before sending the script to the developers.  Also, as the output can be voluminous, it's best to wait for the developers to ask for this information before sending it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can also use <b>reporter</b> to dump only a subset of the shell state. This is sometimes useful for creating startup files for the first time. Most of the output from reporter is far more detailed than usually is necessary for a startup file, but the  <b>aliases</b>, <b>options</b>, and  <b>zstyles</b> states may be useful because they include only changes from the defaults.  The  <b>bindings</b> state may be useful if you have created any of your own keymaps, because  <b>reporter</b> arranges to dump the keymap creation commands as well as the bindings for every keymap.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As is usual with automated tools, if you create a startup file with  <b>reporter</b>, you should edit the results to remove unnecessary commands. Note that if you're using the new completion system, you should  <i>not</i> dump the  <b>functions</b> state to your startup files with <b>reporter</b>; use the  <b>compdump</b> function instead (see  <i>zsh-betacompsys</i>(1)).<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>

<h2>Manipulating Hook Functions</h2><dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>add-zsh-hook</b> [-dD] <i>hook</i> <i>function</i> Several functions are special to the shell, as described in the section SPECIAL FUNCTIONS, see  <i>zsh-betamisc</i>(1), in that they are automatic called at a specific point during shell execution. Each has an associated array consisting of names of functions to be called at the same point; these are so-called `hook functions'. The shell function  <b>add-zsh-hook</b> provides a simple way of adding or removing functions from the array.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>hook</i> is one of <b>chpwd</b>, <b>periodic</b>, <b>precmd</b>, <b>preexec</b>,  <b>zshaddhistory</b>, <b>zshexit</b>, or <b>zsh_directory_name</b>, the special functions in question.  Note that  <b>zsh_directory_name</b> is called in a different way from the other functions, but may still be manipulated as a hook.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>function</i> is name of an ordinary shell function.  If no options are given this will be added to the array of functions to be executed in the given context.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the option <b>-d</b> is given, the <i>function</i> is removed from the array of functions to be executed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the option <b>-D</b> is given, the <i>function</i> is treated as a pattern and any matching names of functions are removed from the array of functions to be executed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The options <b>-U</b>, <b>-z</b> and <b>-k</b> are passed as arguments to  <b>autoload</b> for <i>function</i>.  For functions contributed with zsh, the options  <b>-Uz</b> are appropriate.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>REMEMBERING RECENT DIRECTORIES</h1> The function  <b>cdr</b> allows you to change the working directory to a previous working directory from a list maintained automatically.  It is similar in concept to the directory stack controlled by the  <b>pushd</b>,  <b>popd</b> and <b>dirs</b> builtins, but is more configurable, and as it stores all entries in files it is maintained across sessions and (by default) between terminal emulators in the current session.  (The  <b>pushd</b> directory stack is not actually modified or used by  <b>cdr</b> unless you configure it to do so as described in the configuration section below.)<div class="subsection">
<h2>Installation</h2> The system works by means of a hook function that is called every time the directory changes.  To install the system, autoload the required functions and use the  <b>add-zsh-hook</b> function described above:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>autoload -Uz chpwd_recent_dirs cdr add-zsh-hook</b><br/>
<b>add-zsh-hook chpwd chpwd_recent_dirs</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now every time you change directly interactively, no matter which command you use, the directory to which you change will be remembered in most-recent-first order.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Use</h2> All direct user interaction is via the  <b>cdr</b> function.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The argument to cdr is a number <i>N</i> corresponding to the <i>N</i>th most recently changed-to directory.  1 is the immediately preceding directory; the current directory is remembered but is not offered as a destination. Note that if you have multiple windows open 1 may refer to a directory changed to in another window; you can avoid this by having per-terminal files for storing directory as described for the  <b>recent-dirs-file</b> style below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you set the <b>recent-dirs-default</b> style described below <b>cdr</b> will behave the same as  <b>cd</b> if given a non-numeric argument, or more than one argument.  The recent directory list is updated just the same however you change directory.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the argument is omitted, 1 is assumed.  This is similar to <b>pushd</b>'s behaviour of swapping the two most recent directories on the stack.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Completion for the argument to <b>cdr</b> is available if compinit has been run; menu selection is recommended, using:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':completion:*:*:cdr:*:*' menu selection</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
to allow you to cycle through recent directories; the order is preserved, so the first choice is the most recent directory before the current one. The verbose style is also recommended to ensure the directory is shown; this style is on by default so no action is required unless you have changed it.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Options</h2> The behaviour of  <b>cdr</b> may be modified by the following options.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>-l</b> lists the numbers and the corresponding directories in abbreviated form (i.e. with  <b>~</b> substitution reapplied), one per line. The directories here are not quoted (this would only be an issue if a directory name contained a newline).  This is used by the completion system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-r</b></dt>
<dd>
sets the variable <b>reply</b> to the current set of directories.  Nothing is printed and the directory is not changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-e</b></dt>
<dd>
allows you to edit the list of directories, one per line.  The list can be edited to any extent you like; no sanity checking is performed.  Completion is available.  No quoting is necessary (except for newlines, where I have in any case no sympathy); directories are in unabbreviated from and contain an absolute path, i.e. they start with  <b>/</b>. Usually the first entry should be left as the current directory.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Configuration</h2> Configuration is by means of the styles mechanism that should be familiar from completion; if not, see the description of the  <b>zstyle</b> command in see  <i>zsh-betamodules</i>(1).  The context for setting styles should be  <b>':chpwd:*'</b> in case the meaning of the context is extended in future, for example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':chpwd:*' recent-dirs-max 0</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
sets the value of the <b>recent-dirs-max</b> style to 0.  In practice the style name is specific enough that a context of '*' should be fine.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An exception is <b>recent-dirs-insert</b>, which is used exclusively by the completion system and so has the usual completion system context ( <b>':completion:*'</b> if nothing more specific is needed), though again  <b>'*'</b> should be fine in practice.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>recent-dirs-default</b> If true, and the command is expecting a recent directory index, and either there is more than one argument or the argument is not an integer, then fall through to &quot;cd&quot;.  This allows the lazy to use only one command for directory changing.  Completion recognises this, too; see recent-dirs-insert for how to control completion when this option is in use.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>recent-dirs-file</b></dt>
<dd>
The file where the list of directories is saved.  The default is  <b>${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.chpwd-recent-dirs</b>, i.e. this is in your home directory unless you have set the variable  <b>ZDOTDIR</b> to point somewhere else.  Directory names are saved in  <b>$'</b><i>...</i><b>'</b> quoted form, so each line in the file can be supplied directly to the shell as an argument.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The value of this style may be an array.  In this case, the first file in the list will always be used for saving directories while any other files are left untouched.  When reading the recent directory list, if there are fewer than the maximum number of entries in the first file, the contents of later files in the array will be appended with duplicates removed from the list shown.  The contents of the two files are not sorted together, i.e. all the entries in the first file are shown first.  The special value  <b>+</b> can appear in the list to indicate the default file should be read at that point.  This allows effects like the following:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':chpwd:*' recent-dirs-file \ </b><br/>
<b>~/.chpwd-recent-dirs-${TTY##*/} +</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Recent directories are read from a file numbered according to the terminal.  If there are insufficient entries the list is supplemented from the default file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is possible to use <b>zstyle -e</b> to make the directory configurable at run time:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle -e ':chpwd:*' recent-dirs-file pick-recent-dirs-file</b><br/>
<b>pick-recent-dirs-file() {</b><br/>
<b>  if [[ $PWD = ~/text/writing(|/*) ]]; then</b><br/>
<b>    reply=(~/.chpwd-recent-dirs-writing)</b><br/>
<b>  else</b><br/>
<b>    reply=(+)</b><br/>
<b>  fi</b><br/>
<b>}</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In this example, if the current directory is <b>~/text/writing</b> or a directory under it, then use a special file for saving recent directories, else use the default.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>recent-dirs-insert</b></dt>
<dd>
Used by completion.  If <b>recent-dirs-default</b> is true, then setting this to  <b>true</b> causes the actual directory, rather than its index, to be inserted on the command line; this has the same effect as using the corresponding index, but makes the history clearer and the line easier to edit.  With this setting, if part of an argument was already typed, normal directory completion rather than recent directory completion is done; this is because recent directory completion is expected to be done by cycling through entries menu fashion.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the value of the style is <b>always</b>, then only recent directories will be completed; in that case, use the  <b>cd</b> command when you want to complete other directories.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the value is <b>fallback</b>, recent directories will be tried first, then normal directory completion is performed if recent directory completion failed to find a match.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Finally, if the value is <b>both</b> then both sets of completions are presented; the usual tag mechanism can be used to distinguish results, with recent directories tagged as  <b>recent-dirs</b>.  Note that the recent directories inserted are abbreviated with directory names where appropriate.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>recent-dirs-max</b></dt>
<dd>
The maximum number of directories to save to the file.  If this is zero or negative there is no maximum.  The default is 20. Note this includes the current directory, which isn't offered, so the highest number of directories you will be offered is one less than the maximum.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>recent-dirs-prune</b></dt>
<dd>
This style is an array determining what directories should (or should not) be added to the recent list.  Elements of the array can include:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>parent</b> Prune parents (more accurately, ancestors) from the recent list. If present, changing directly down by any number of directories causes the current directory to be overwritten.  For example, changing from ~pws to ~pws/some/other/dir causes ~pws not to be left on the recent directory stack.  This only applies to direct changes to descendant directories; earlier directories on the list are not pruned.  For example, changing from ~pws/yet/another to ~pws/some/other/dir does not cause ~pws to be pruned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>pattern:</b><i>pattern</i><b></b><i></i></dt>
<dd>
Gives a zsh pattern for directories that should not be added to the recent list (if not already there).  This element can be repeated to add different patterns.  For example,  <b>'pattern:/tmp(|/*)'</b> stops <b>/tmp</b> or its descendants from being added.  The  <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> option is always turned on for these patterns.</dd>
</dl>

If set to true, <b>cdr</b> will use <b>pushd</b> instead of <b>cd</b> to change the directory, so the directory is saved on the directory stack.  As the directory stack is completely separate from the list of files saved by the mechanism used in this file there is no obvious reason to do this.</dd>

<h2>Use with dynamic directory naming</h2> It is possible to refer to recent directories using the dynamic directory name syntax by using the supplied function  <b>zsh_directory_name_cdr</b> a hook:<div class="spacer">

<h2>Details of directory handling</h2> This section is for the curious or confused; most users will not need to know this information.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Recent directories are saved to a file immediately and hence are preserved across sessions.  Note currently no file locking is applied: the list is updated immediately on interactive commands and nowhere else (unlike history), and it is assumed you are only going to change directory in one window at once.  This is not safe on shared accounts, but in any case the system has limited utility when someone else is changing to a different set of directories behind your back.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To make this a little safer, only directory changes instituted from the command line, either directly or indirectly through shell function calls (but not through subshells, evals, traps, completion functions and the like) are saved.  Shell functions should use  <b>cd -q</b> or <b>pushd -q</b> to avoid side effects if the change to the directory is to be invisible at the command line.  See the contents of the function  <b>chpwd_recent_dirs</b> for more details.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>GATHERING INFORMATION FROM VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS</h1> In a lot of cases, it is nice to automatically retrieve information from version control systems (VCSs), such as subversion, CVS or git, to be able to provide it to the user; possibly in the user's prompt. So that you can instantly tell which branch you are currently on, for example.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In order to do that, you may use the <b>vcs_info</b> function.<div class="spacer">

To load <b>vcs_info</b>:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>autoload -Uz vcs_info</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It can be used in any existing prompt, because it does not require any  <b>$psvar</b> entries to be left available.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Quickstart</h2> To get this feature working quickly (including colors), you can do the following (assuming, you loaded  <b>vcs_info</b> properly - see above):<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:*' actionformats \ </b><br/>
<b>    '%F{5}(%f%s%F{5})%F{3}-%F{5}[%F{2}%b%F{3}|%F{1}%a%F{5}]%f '</b><br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:*' formats       \ </b><br/>
<b>    '%F{5}(%f%s%F{5})%F{3}-%F{5}[%F{2}%b%F{5}]%f '</b><br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:(sv[nk]|bzr):*' branchformat '%b%F{1}:%F{3}%r'</b><br/>
<b>precmd () { vcs_info }</b><br/>
<b>PS1='%F{5}[%F{2}%n%F{5}] %F{3}%3~ ${vcs_info_msg_0_}%f%# '</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Obviously, the last two lines are there for demonstration. You need to call  <b>vcs_info</b> from your <b>precmd</b> function. Once that is done you need a  <b>single quoted</b> <b>'${vcs_info_msg_0_}'</b> in your prompt.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To be able to use <b>'${vcs_info_msg_0_}'</b> directly in your prompt like this, you will need to have the  <b>PROMPT_SUBST</b> option enabled.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now call the <b>vcs_info_printsys</b> utility from the command line:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>% vcs_info_printsys</b><br/>
<b>## list of supported version control backends:</b><br/>
<b>## disabled systems are prefixed by a hash sign (#)</b><br/>
<b>bzr</b><br/>
<b>cdv</b><br/>
<b>cvs</b><br/>
<b>darcs</b><br/>
<b>fossil</b><br/>
<b>git</b><br/>
<b>hg</b><br/>
<b>mtn</b><br/>
<b>p4</b><br/>
<b>svk</b><br/>
<b>svn</b><br/>
<b>tla</b><br/>
<b>## flavours (cannot be used in the enable or disable styles; they</b><br/>
<b>## are enabled and disabled with their master [git-svn -&gt; git])</b><br/>
<b>## they *can* be used in contexts: ':vcs_info:git-svn:*'.</b><br/>
<b>git-p4</b><br/>
<b>git-svn</b><br/>
<b>hg-git</b><br/>
<b>hg-hgsubversion</b><br/>
<b>hg-hgsvn</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may not want all of these because there is no point in running the code to detect systems you do not use.  So there is a way to disable some backends altogether:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:*' disable bzr cdv darcs mtn svk tla</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may also pick a few from that list and enable only those:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:*' enable git cvs svn</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you rerun <b>vcs_info_printsys</b> after one of these commands, you will see the backends listed in the  <b>disable</b> style (or backends not in the  <b>enable</b> style - if you used that) marked as disabled by a hash sign. That means the detection of these systems is skipped  <i>completely</i>. No wasted time there.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Configuration</h2> The  <b>vcs_info</b> feature can be configured via <b>zstyle</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
First, the context in which we are working:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>:vcs_info:</b><i>vcs-string</i><b>:</b><i>user-context</i><b>:</b><i>repo-root-name</i><b></b><i></i><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<i>vcs-string</i> is one of:  <b>git</b>, <b>git-svn</b>, <b>git-p4</b>, <b>hg</b>, <b>hg-git</b>,  <b>hg-hgsubversion</b>, <b>hg-hgsvn</b>, <b>darcs</b>, <b>bzr</b>, <b>cdv</b>, <b>mtn</b>,  <b>svn</b>, <b>cvs</b>, <b>svk</b>, <b>tla</b>, <b>p4</b> or <b>fossil</b>. When hooks are active the hooks name is added after a `+'. (See  <b>Hooks in vcs_info</b> below.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>user-context</i></dt>
<dd>
is a freely configurable string, assignable by the user as the first argument to  <b>vcs_info</b> (see its description below).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>repo-root-name</i></dt>
<dd>
is the name of a repository in which you want a style to match. So, if you want a setting specific to  <b>/usr/src/zsh</b>, with that being a CVS checkout, you can set  <i>repo-root-name</i> to  <b>zsh</b> to make it so.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are three special values for <i>vcs-string</i>: The first is named  <b>-init-</b>, that is in effect as long as there was no decision what VCS backend to use. The second is  <b>-preinit-</b>; it is used <i>before</i>  <b>vcs_info</b> is run, when initializing the data exporting variables. The third special value is  <b>formats</b> and is used by the <b>vcs_info_lastmsg</b> for looking up its styles.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The initial value of <i>repo-root-name</i> is <b>-all-</b> and it is replaced with the actual name, as soon as it is known. Only use this part of the context for defining the  <b>formats</b>, <b>actionformats</b> or  <b>branchformat</b> styles, as it is guaranteed that <i>repo-root-name</i> is set up correctly for these only. For all other styles, just use  <b>'*'</b> instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are two pre-defined values for <i>user-context</i>:<dl>
<dt>
<b>default</b></dt>
<dd>
the one used if none is specified</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>command</b></dt>
<dd>
used by vcs_info_lastmsg to lookup its styles</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can of course use <b>':vcs_info:*'</b> to match all VCSs in all user-contexts at once.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is a description of all styles that are looked up.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>formats</b> A list of formats, used when actionformats is not used (which is most of the time).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>actionformats</b></dt>
<dd>
A list of formats, used if there is a special action going on in your current repository; like an interactive rebase or a merge conflict.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>branchformat</b></dt>
<dd>
Some backends replace <b>%b</b> in the formats and actionformats styles above, not only by a branch name but also by a revision number. This style lets you modify how that string should look.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>nvcsformats</b></dt>
<dd>
These &quot;formats&quot; are exported when we didn't detect a version control system for the current directory or  <b>vcs_info</b> was disabled. This is useful if you want  <b>vcs_info</b> to completely take over the generation of your prompt. You would do something like  <b>PS1='${vcs_info_msg_0_}'</b> to accomplish that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>hgrevformat</b></dt>
<dd>
<b>hg</b> uses both a hash and a revision number to reference a specific changeset in a repository. With this style you can format the revision string (see  <b>branchformat</b>) to include either or both. It's only useful when  <b>get-revision</b> is true.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>max-exports</b></dt>
<dd>
Defines the maximum number of  <b>vcs_info_msg_*_</b> variables <b>vcs_info</b> will export.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>enable</b></dt>
<dd>
A list of backends you want to use. Checked in the <b>-init-</b> context. If this list contains an item called  <b>NONE</b> no backend is used at all and  <b>vcs_info</b> will do nothing. If this list contains <b>ALL</b>, <b>vcs_info</b> will use all known backends. Only with  <b>ALL</b> in <b>enable</b> will the  <b>disable</b> style have any effect. <b>ALL</b> and <b>NONE</b> are case insensitive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>disable</b></dt>
<dd>
A list of VCSs you don't want <b>vcs_info</b> to test for repositories (checked in the  <b>-init-</b> context, too). Only used if  <b>enable</b> contains <b>ALL</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>disable-patterns</b></dt>
<dd>
A list of patterns that are checked against <b>$PWD</b>. If a pattern matches,  <b>vcs_info</b> will be disabled. This style is checked in the  <b>:vcs_info:-init-:*:-all-</b> context.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Say, <b>~/.zsh</b> is a directory under version control, in which you do not want  <b>vcs_info</b> to be active, do:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:*' disable-patterns &quot;$HOME/.zsh(|/*)&quot;</b><br/>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>use-quilt</b></dt>
<dd>
If enabled, the <b>quilt</b> support code is active in `addon' mode. See  <b>Quilt Support</b> for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>quilt-standalone</b></dt>
<dd>
If enabled, `standalone' mode detection is attempted if no VCS is active in a given directory. See  <b>Quilt Support</b> for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>quilt-patch-dir</b></dt>
<dd>
Overwrite the value of the <b>$QUILT_PATCHES</b> environment variable. See  <b>Quilt Support</b> for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>quiltcommand</b></dt>
<dd>
When <b>quilt</b> itself is called in quilt support the value of this style is used as the command name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>check-for-changes</b></dt>
<dd>
If enabled, this style causes the <b>%c</b> and <b>%u</b> format escapes to show when the working directory has uncommitted changes. The strings displayed by these escapes can be controlled via the  <b>stagedstr</b> and <b>unstagedstr</b> styles. The only backends that currently support this option are  <b>git</b> and  <b>hg</b> (<b>hg</b> only supports unstaged).</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For this style to be evaluated with the <b>hg</b> backend, the <b>get-revision</b> style needs to be set and the  <b>use-simple</b> style needs to be unset. The latter is the default; the former is not.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note, the actions taken if this style is enabled are potentially expensive (read: they may be slow, depending on how big the current repository is). Therefore, it is disabled by default.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>stagedstr</b></dt>
<dd>
This string will be used in the <b>%c</b> escape if there are staged changes in the repository.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>unstagedstr</b></dt>
<dd>
This string will be used in the <b>%u</b> escape if there are unstaged changes in the repository.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>command</b></dt>
<dd>
This style causes <b>vcs_info</b> to use the supplied string as the command to use as the VCS's binary. Note, that setting this in ':vcs_info:*' is not a good idea.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the value of this style is empty (which is the default), the used binary name is the name of the backend in use (e.g.  <b>svn</b> is used in an <b>svn</b> repository).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>repo-root-name</b> part in the context is always the default <b>-all-</b> when this style is looked up.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, this style can be used to use binaries from non-default installation directories. Assume,  <b>git</b> is installed in /usr/bin but your sysadmin installed a newer version in /usr/bin/local. Instead of changing the order of your  <b>$PATH</b> parameter, you can do this:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*:-all-' command /usr/local/bin/git</b><br/>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>use-server</b></dt>
<dd>
This is used by the Perforce backend (<b>p4</b>) to decide if it should contact the Perforce server to find out if a directory is managed by Perforce.  This is the only reliable way of doing this, but runs the risk of a delay if the server name cannot be found.  If the server (more specifically, the  <b>host</b><b>:</b><b>port</b> pair describing the server) cannot be contacted, its name is put into the associative array  <b>vcs_info_p4_dead_servers</b> and is not contacted again during the session until it is removed by hand.  If you do not set this style, the  <b>p4</b> backend is only usable if you have set the environment variable  <b>P4CONFIG</b> to a file name and have corresponding files in the root directories of each Perforce client.  See comments in the function  <b>VCS_INFO_detect_p4</b> for more detail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>use-simple</b></dt>
<dd>
If there are two different ways of gathering information, you can select the simpler one by setting this style to true; the default is to use the not-that-simple code, which is potentially a lot slower but might be more accurate in all possible cases. This style is used by the  <b>bzr</b> and <b>hg</b> backends. In the case of <b>hg</b> it will invoke the external hexdump program to parse the binary dirstate cache file; this method will not return the local revision number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>get-revision</b></dt>
<dd>
If set to true, vcs_info goes the extra mile to figure out the revision of a repository's work tree (currently for the  <b>git</b> and <b>hg</b> backends, where this kind of information is not always vital). For  <b>git</b>, the hash value of the currently checked out commit is available via the  <b>%i</b> expansion. With  <b>hg</b>, the local revision number and the corresponding global hash are available via  <b>%i</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>get-mq</b></dt>
<dd>
If set to true, the <b>hg</b> backend will look for a Mercurial Queue (<b>mq</b>) patch directory. Information will be available via the ` <b>%m</b>' replacement.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>get-bookmarks</b></dt>
<dd>
If set to true, the <b>hg</b> backend will try to get a list of current bookmarks. They will be available via the ` <b>%m</b>' replacement.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>use-prompt-escapes</b></dt>
<dd>
Determines if we assume that the assembled string from  <b>vcs_info</b> includes prompt escapes. (Used by  <b>vcs_info_lastmsg</b>.)</dd>

Not all VCS backends have to support all replacements. For <b>nvcsformats</b> no replacements are performed at all, it is just a string.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Oddities</h2> If you want to use the  <b>%b</b> (bold off) prompt expansion in <b>formats</b>, which expands  <b>%b</b> itself, use <b>%%b</b>. That will cause the <b>vcs_info</b> expansion to replace  <b>%%b</b> with <b>%b</b>, so that zsh's prompt expansion mechanism can handle it. Similarly, to hand down  <b>%b</b> from  <b>branchformat</b>, use <b>%%%%b</b>. Sorry for this inconvenience, but it cannot be easily avoided. Luckily we do not clash with a lot of prompt expansions and this only needs to be done for those.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Quilt Support</h2>  <b>Quilt</b> is not a version control system, therefore this is not implemented as a backend. It can help keeping track of a series of patches. People use it to keep a set of changes they want to use on top of software packages (which is tightly integrated into the package build process - the Debian project does this for a large number of packages). Quilt can also help individual developers keep track of their own patches on top of real version control systems.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>vcs_info</b> integration tries to support both ways of using quilt by having two slightly different modes of operation: `addon' mode and `standalone' mode).<div class="spacer">
</div>
For `addon' mode to become active <b>vcs_info</b> must have already detected a real version control system controlling the directory. If that is the case, a directory that holds quilt's patches needs to be found. That directory is configurable via the ` <b>QUILT_PATCHES</b>' environment variable. If that variable exists its value is used, otherwise the value ` <b>patches</b>' is assumed. The value from  <b>$QUILT_PATCHES</b> can be overwritten using the  <b>`quilt-patches'</b> style. (Note: you can use <b>vcs_info</b> to keep the value of  <b>$QUILT_PATCHES</b> correct all the time via the <b>post-quilt</b> hook).<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the directory in question is found, quilt is assumed to be active. To gather more information,  <b>vcs_info</b> looks for a directory called `.pc'; Quilt uses that directory to track its current state. If this directory does not exist we know that quilt has not done anything to the working directory (read: no patches have been applied yet).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If patches are applied, <b>vcs_info</b> will try to find out which. If you want to know which patches of a series are not yet applied, you need to activate the  <b>get-unapplied</b> style in the appropriate context.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>vcs_info</b> allows for very detailed control over how the gathered information is presented (see the below sections,  <b>Styles</b> and <b>Hooks in</b>  <b>vcs_info</b>), all of which are documented below. Note there are a number of other patch tracking systems that work on top of a certain version control system (like  <b>stgit</b> for <b>git</b>, or <b>mq</b> for <b>hg</b>); the configuration for systems like that are generally configured the same way as the  <b>quilt</b> support.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <b>quilt</b> support is working in `addon' mode, the produced string is available as a simple format replacement ( <b>%Q</b> to be precise), which can be used in  <b>formats</b> and <b>actionformats</b>; see below for details).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If, on the other hand, the support code is working in `standalone' mode,  <b>vcs_info</b> will pretend as if <b>quilt</b> were an actual version control system. That means that the version control system identifier (which otherwise would be something like `svn' or `cvs') will be set to ` <b>-quilt-</b>'. This has implications on the used style context where this identifier is the second element.  <b>vcs_info</b> will have filled in a proper value for the &quot;repository's&quot; root directory and the string containing the information about quilt's state will be available as the `misc' replacement (and  <b>%Q</b> for compatibility with `addon' mode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
What is left to discuss is how `standalone' mode is detected. The detection itself is a series of searches for directories. You can have this detection enabled all the time in every directory that is not otherwise under version control. If you know there is only a limited set of trees where you would like  <b>vcs_info</b> to try and look for Quilt in `standalone' mode to minimise the amount of searching on every call to  <b>vcs_info</b>, there are a number of ways to do that:<div class="spacer">
</div>
Essentially, `standalone' mode detection is controlled by a style called ` <b>quilt-standalone</b>'. It is a string style and its value can have different effects. The simplest values are: ` <b>always</b>' to run detection every time  <b>vcs_info</b> is run, and `<b>never</b>' to turn the detection off entirely.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the value of <b>quilt-standalone</b> is something else, it is interpreted differently. If the value is the name of a scalar variable the value of that variable is checked and that value is used in the same `always'/`never' way as described above.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the value of <b>quilt-standalone</b> is an array, the elements of that array are used as directory names under which you want the detection to be active.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <b>quilt-standalone</b> is an associative array, the keys are taken as directory names under which you want the detection to be active, but only if the corresponding value is the string ` <b>true</b>'.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Last, but not least, if the value of <b>quilt-standalone</b> is the name of a function, the function is called without arguments and the return value decides whether detection should be active. A `0' return value is true; a non-zero return value is interpreted as false.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note, if there is both a function and a variable by the name of  <b>quilt-standalone</b>, the function will take precedence.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Function Descriptions (Public API)</h2><dl>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>vcs_info_hookadd</b></dt>
<dd>
Statically registers a number of functions to a given hook. The hook needs to be given as the first argument; what follows is a list of hook-function names to register to the hook. The ` <b>+vi-</b>' prefix needs to be left out here. See  <b>Hooks in vcs_info</b> below for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>vcs_info_hookdel</b></dt>
<dd>
Remove hook-functions from a given hook. The hook needs to be given as the first non-option argument; what follows is a list of hook-function names to un-register from the hook. If ` <b>-a</b>' is used as the first argument,  <b>all</b> occurances of the functions are unregistered. Otherwise only the last occurance is removed (if a function was registered to a hook more than once) . The ` <b>+vi-</b>' prefix needs to be left out here. See  <b>Hooks in vcs_info</b> below for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>vcs_info_lastmsg</b></dt>
<dd>
Outputs the last <b>${vcs_info_msg_*_}</b> value. Takes into account the value of the  <b>use-prompt-escapes</b> style in  <b>':vcs_info:formats:command:-all-'</b>. It also only prints <b>max-exports</b> values.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>vcs_info_printsys</b> [<i>user-context</i>]</dt>
<dd>
Prints a list of all supported version control systems. Useful to find out possible contexts (and which of them are enabled) or values for the  <b>disable</b> style.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>vcs_info_setsys</b></dt>
<dd>
Initializes <b>vcs_info</b>'s internal list of available backends. With this function, you can add support for new VCSs without restarting the shell.</dd>

<h2>Hooks in vcs_info</h2> Hooks are places in  <b>vcs_info</b> where you can run your own code. That code can communicate with the code that called it and through that, change the system's behaviour.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For configuration, hooks change the style context:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>:vcs_info:</b><i>vcs-string</i><b>+</b><i>hook-name</i><b>:</b><i>user-context</i><b>:</b><i>repo-root-name</i><b></b><i></i><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To register functions to a hook, you need to list them in the <b>hooks</b> style in the appropriate context.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Example:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:*+foo:*' hooks bar baz</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This registers functions to the hook `foo' for all backends. In order to avoid namespace problems, all registered function names are prepended by a `+vi-', so the actual functions called for the `foo' hook are ` <b>+vi-bar</b>' and `<b>+vi-baz</b>'.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you would like to register a function to a hook regardless of the current context, you may use the  <b>vcs_info_hookadd</b> function. To remove a function that was added like that, the  <b>vcs_info_hookdel</b> function can be used.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If something seems weird, you can enable the `debug' boolean style in the proper context and the hook-calling code will print what it tried to execute and whether the function in question existed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When you register more than one function to a hook, all functions are executed one after another until one function returns non-zero or until all functions have been called. Context-sensitive hook functions are executed  <b>before</b> statically registered ones (the ones added by  <b>vcs_info_hookadd</b>).<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may pass data between functions via an associative array, <b>user_data</b>. For example:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><br/>
<b>+vi-git-myfirsthook(){</b><br/>
<b>    user_data[myval]=$myval</b><br/>
<b>}</b><br/>
<b>+vi-git-mysecondhook(){</b><br/>
<b>    # do something with ${user_data[myval]}</b><br/>
<b>}</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">

There are a number of variables that are special in hook contexts:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>ret</b> The return value that the hooks system will return to the caller. The default is an integer `zero'. If and how a changed  <b>ret</b> value changes the execution of the caller depends on the specific hook. See the hook documentation below for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>hook_com</b></dt>

There are a number of `<b>hook_com</b>' keys, that are used here: ` <b>action</b>', `<b>branch</b>', `<b>base</b>', `<b>base-name</b>', `<b>subdir</b>', ` <b>staged</b>', `<b>unstaged</b>', `<b>revision</b>', `<b>misc</b>', `<b>vcs</b>' and one ` <b>miscN</b>' entry for each backend-specific data field (<b>N</b> starting at zero). They are set to the values figured out so far by  <b>vcs_info</b> and any change will be used directly when the actual replacement is done.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since this hook is triggered multiple times (once for each configured  <b>formats</b> or <b>actionformats</b>), each of the `<b>hook_com</b>' keys mentioned above (except for the  <b>miscN</b> entries) has an `<b>_orig</b>' counterpart, so even if you changed a value to your liking you can still get the original value in the next run. Changing the ` <b>_orig</b>' values is probably not a good idea.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <b>ret</b> is set to non-zero, the string in  <b>${hook_com[message]}</b> will be used unchanged as the message by  <b>vcs_info</b>.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If all of this sounds rather confusing, take a look at the <b>Examples</b> section below and also in the Misc/vcs_info-examples file in the Zsh source. They contain some explanatory code.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Examples</h2> Don't use  <b>vcs_info</b> at all (even though it's in your prompt):<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
All <b>%x</b> expansion in all sorts of formats (&quot;formats&quot;, &quot;actionformats&quot;, branchformat, you name it) are done using the ` <b>zformat</b>' builtin from the ` <b>zsh/zutil</b>' module. That means you can do everything with these  <b>%x</b> items what zformat supports. In particular, if you want something that is really long to have a fixed width, like a hash in a mercurial branchformat, you can do this:  <b>%12.12i</b>. That'll shrink the 40 character hash to its 12 leading characters. The form is actually ` <b>%</b><i>min</i><b>.</b><i>max</i><b>x</b>'. More is possible. See the section `The zsh/zutil Module' in  <i>zsh-betamodules</i>(1) for details.<div class="spacer">

If you want colors, make sure you enclose the color codes in <b>%{...%}</b> if you want to use the string provided by  <b>vcs_info</b> in prompts.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here is how to print the VCS information as a command (not in a prompt):<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>alias vcsi='vcs_info command; vcs_info_lastmsg'</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This way, you can even define different formats for output via  <b>vcs_info_lastmsg</b> in the ':vcs_info:*:command:*' namespace.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now as promised, some code that uses hooks: say, you'd like to replace the string `svn' by `subversion' in  <b>vcs_info</b>'s <b>%s</b> <b>formats</b> replacement.<div class="spacer">
</div>
First, we will tell <b>vcs_info</b> to call a function when populating the message variables with the gathered information:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:*+set-message:*' hooks svn2subversion</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Nothing happens. Which is reasonable, since we didn't define the actual function yet. To see what the hooks subsystem is trying to do, enable the ` <b>debug</b>' style:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:*+*:*' debug true</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
That should give you an idea what is going on. Specifically, the function that we are looking for is ` <b>+vi-svn2subversion</b>'. Note, the `<b>+vi-</b>' prefix. So, everything is in order, just as documented. When you are done checking out the debugging output, disable it again:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:*+*:*' debug false</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now, let's define the function:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><br/>
<b>function +vi-svn2subversion() {</b><br/>
<b>    [[ ${hook_com[vcs_orig]} == svn ]] &amp;&amp; hook_com[vcs]=subversion</b><br/>
<b>}</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Simple enough. And it could have even been simpler, if only we had registered our function in a less generic context. If we do it only in the ` <b>svn</b>' backend's context, we don't need to test which the active backend is:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:svn+set-message:*' hooks svn2subversion</b><br/>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><br/>
<b>function +vi-svn2subversion() {</b><br/>
<b>    hook_com[vcs]=subversion</b><br/>
<b>}</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And finally a little more elaborate example, that uses a hook to create a customised bookmark string for the  <b>hg</b> backend.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Again, we start off by registering a function:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':vcs_info:hg+gen-hg-bookmark-string:*' hooks hgbookmarks</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And then we define the `<b>+vi-hgbookmarks</b> function:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><br/>
<b>function +vi-hgbookmarks() {</b><br/>
<b>    # The default is to connect all bookmark names by</b><br/>
<b>    # commas. This mixes things up a little.</b><br/>
<b>    # Imagine, there's one type of bookmarks that is</b><br/>
<b>    # special to you. Say, because it's *your* work.</b><br/>

<h1>PROMPT THEMES</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Installation</h2> You should make sure all the functions from the  <b>Functions/Prompts</b> directory of the source distribution are available; they all begin with the string ` <b>prompt_</b>' except for the special function`<b>promptinit</b>'. You also need the ` <b>colors</b>' function from <b>Functions/Misc</b>.  All of these functions may already have been installed on your system; if not, you will need to find them and copy them.  The directory should appear as one of the elements of the  <b>fpath</b> array (this should already be the case if they were installed), and at least the function  <b>promptinit</b> should be autoloaded; it will autoload the rest.  Finally, to initialize the use of the system you need to call the  <b>promptinit</b> function.  The following code in your  <b>.zshrc</b> will arrange for this; assume the functions are stored in the directory  <b>~/myfns</b>:<div class="spacer">

<h1>ZLE FUNCTIONS</h1><div class="subsection">

bash-style word functions If you are looking for functions to implement moving over and editing words in the manner of bash, where only alphanumeric characters are considered word characters, you can use the functions described in the next section.  The following is sufficient:</dd>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

<dd>
<b>select-word-style</b>, <b>match-word-context</b>, <b>match-words-by-style</b> The eight ` <b>-match</b>' functions are drop-in replacements for the builtin widgets without the suffix.  By default they behave in a similar way.  However, by the use of styles and the function  <b>select-word-style</b>, the way words are matched can be altered.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use  <b>select-word-style</b>, which can either be called as a normal function with the appropriate argument, or invoked as a user-defined widget that will prompt for the first character of the word style to be used.  The first time it is invoked, the eight  <b>-match</b> functions will automatically replace the builtin versions, so they do not need to be loaded explicitly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The word styles available are as follows.  Only the first character is examined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>bash</b> Word characters are alphanumeric characters only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>normal</b></dt>
<dd>
As in normal shell operation:  word characters are alphanumeric characters plus any characters present in the string given by the parameter  <b>$WORDCHARS</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>shell</b></dt>
<dd>
Words are complete shell command arguments, possibly including complete quoted strings, or any tokens special to the shell.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>whitespace</b></dt>
<dd>
Words are any set of characters delimited by whitespace.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>default</b></dt>
<dd>
Restore the default settings; this is usually the same as `<b>normal</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
All but `<b>default</b>' can be input as an upper case character, which has the same effect but with subword matching turned on.  In this case, words with upper case characters are treated specially: each separate run of upper case characters, or an upper case character followed by any number of other characters, is considered a word.  The style  <b>subword-range</b> can supply an alternative character range to the default ` <b>[:upper:]</b>'; the value of the style is treated as the contents of a ` <b>[</b><i>...</i><b>]</b>' pattern (note that the outer brackets should not be supplied, only those surrounding named ranges).<div class="spacer">
</div>
More control can be obtained using the <b>zstyle</b> command, as described in  <i>zsh-betamodules</i>(1).  Each style is looked up in the context  <b>:zle:</b><i>widget</i> where <i>widget</i> is the name of the user-defined widget, not the name of the function implementing it, so in the case of the definitions supplied by  <b>select-word-style</b> the appropriate contexts are  <b>:zle:forward-word</b>, and so on.  The function  <b>select-word-style</b> itself always defines styles for the context ` <b>:zle:*</b>' which can be overridden by more specific (longer) patterns as well as explicit contexts.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The style <b>word-style</b> specifies the rules to use.  This may have the following values.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>normal</b> Use the standard shell rules, i.e. alphanumerics and  <b>$WORDCHARS</b>, unless overridden by the styles  <b>word-chars</b> or <b>word-class</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>specified</b></dt>
<dd>
Similar to <b>normal</b>, but <i>only</i> the specified characters, and not also alphanumerics, are considered word characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>unspecified</b></dt>
<dd>
The negation of specified.  The given characters are those which will  <i>not</i> be considered part of a word.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>shell</b></dt>
<dd>
Words are obtained by using the syntactic rules for generating shell command arguments.  In addition, special tokens which are never command arguments such as ` <b>()</b>' are also treated as words.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>whitespace</b></dt>
<dd>
Words are whitespace-delimited strings of characters.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first three of those rules usually use <b>$WORDCHARS</b>, but the value in the parameter can be overridden by the style  <b>word-chars</b>, which works in exactly the same way as  <b>$WORDCHARS</b>.  In addition, the style  <b>word-class</b> uses character class syntax to group characters and takes precedence over  <b>word-chars</b> if both are set.  The <b>word-class</b> style does not include the surrounding brackets of the character class; for example, ` <b>-:[:alnum:]</b>' is a valid <b>word-class</b> to include all alphanumerics plus the characters ` <b>-</b>' and `<b>:</b>'.  Be careful including ` <b>]</b>', `<b>^</b>' and `<b>-</b>' as these are special inside character classes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>word-style</b> may also have `<b>-subword</b>' appended to its value to turn on subword matching, as described above.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The style <b>skip-chars</b> is mostly useful for  <b>transpose-words</b> and similar functions.  If set, it gives a count of characters starting at the cursor position which will not be considered part of the word and are treated as space, regardless of what they actually are.  For example, if<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':zle:transpose-words' skip-chars 1</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
has been set, and <b>transpose-words-match</b> is called with the cursor on the  <i>X</i> of <b>foo</b><i>X</i><b>bar</b>, where <i>X</i> can be any character, then the resulting expression is  <b>bar</b><i>X</i><b>foo</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Finer grained control can be obtained by setting the style <b>word-context</b> to an array of pairs of entries.  Each pair of entries consists of a  <i>pattern</i> and a <i>subcontext</i>.  The shell argument the cursor is on is matched against each  <i>pattern</i> in turn until one matches; if it does, the context is extended by a colon and the corresponding  <i>subcontext</i>. Note that the test is made against the original word on the line, with no stripping of quotes.  Special handling is done between words: the current context is examined and if it contains the string  <b>back</b>, the word before the cursor is considered, else the word after cursor is considered. Some examples are given below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here are some examples of use of the styles, actually taken from the simplified interface in  <b>select-word-style</b>:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':zle:*' word-style standard</b><br/>
<b>zstyle ':zle:*' word-chars ''</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Implements bash-style word handling for all widgets, i.e. only alphanumerics are word characters; equivalent to setting the parameter  <b>WORDCHARS</b> empty for the given context.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>style ':zle:*kill*' word-style space</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Uses space-delimited words for widgets with the word `kill' in the name. Neither of the styles  <b>word-chars</b> nor <b>word-class</b> is used in this case.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here are some examples of use of the <b>word-context</b> style to extend the context.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':zle:*' word-context &quot;*/*&quot; file &quot;[[:space:]]&quot; whitespace</b><br/>
<b>zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:whitespace' word-style shell</b><br/>
<b>zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:filename' word-style normal</b><br/>
<b>zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:filename' word-chars ''</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This provides two different ways of using <b>transpose-words</b> depending on whether the cursor is on whitespace between words or on a filename, here any word containing a  <b>/</b>.  On whitespace, complete arguments as defined by standard shell rules will be transposed.  In a filename, only alphanumerics will be transposed.  Elsewhere, words will be transposed using the default style for  <b>:zle:transpose-words</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The word matching and all the handling of <b>zstyle</b> settings is actually implemented by the function  <b>match-words-by-style</b>.  This can be used to create new user-defined widgets.  The calling function should set the local parameter  <b>curcontext</b> to <b>:zle:</b><i>widget</i>, create the local parameter  <b>matched_words</b> and call <b>match-words-by-style</b> with no arguments.  On return,  <b>matched_words</b> will be set to an array with the elements: (1) the start of the line (2) the word before the cursor (3) any non-word characters between that word and the cursor (4) any non-word character at the cursor position plus any remaining non-word characters before the next word, including all characters specified by the  <b>skip-chars</b> style, (5) the word at or following the cursor (6) any non-word characters following that word (7) the remainder of the line.  Any of the elements may be an empty string; the calling function should test for this to decide whether it can perform its function.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is possible to pass options with arguments to <b>match-words-by-style</b> to override the use of styles.  The options are:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-w</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>word-style</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-s</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>skip-chars</i></dd>

<b>-C</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>word-chars</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-r</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>subword-range</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, <b>match-words-by-style -w shell -c 0</b> may be used to extract the command argument around the cursor.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>word-context</b> style is implemented by the function  <b>match-word-context</b>.  This should not usually need to be called directly.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>copy-earlier-word</b></dt>
<dd>
This widget works like a combination of <b>insert-last-word</b> and  <b>copy-prev-shell-word</b>.  Repeated invocations of the widget retrieve earlier words on the relevant history line.  With a numeric argument  <i>N</i>, insert the <i>N</i>th word from the history line; <i>N</i> may be negative to count from the end of the line.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <b>insert-last-word</b> has been used to retrieve the last word on a previous history line, repeated invocations will replace that word with earlier words from the same line.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Otherwise, the widget applies to words on the line currently being edited. The  <b>widget</b> style can be set to the name of another widget that should be called to retrieve words.  This widget must accept the same three arguments as  <b>insert-last-word</b>.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>cycle-completion-positions</b></dt>
<dd>
After inserting an unambiguous string into the command line, the new function based completion system may know about multiple places in this string where characters are missing or differ from at least one of the possible matches.  It will then place the cursor on the position it considers to be the most interesting one, i.e. the one where one can disambiguate between as many matches as possible with as little typing as possible.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This widget allows the cursor to be easily moved to the other interesting spots.  It can be invoked repeatedly to cycle between all positions reported by the completion system.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>delete-whole-word-match</b></dt>
<dd>
This is another function which works like the <b>-match</b> functions described immediately above, i.e. using styles to decide the word boundaries.  However, it is not a replacement for any existing function.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The basic behaviour is to delete the word around the cursor.  There is no numeric prefix handling; only the single word around the cursor is considered.  If the widget contains the string  <b>kill</b>, the removed text will be placed in the cutbuffer for future yanking.  This can be obtained by defining  <b>kill-whole-word-match</b> as follows:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zle -N kill-whole-word-match delete-whole-word-match</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
and then binding the widget <b>kill-whole-word-match</b>.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>up-line-or-beginning-search</b>, <b>down-line-or-beginning-search</b></dt>
<dd>
These widgets are similar to the builtin functions <b>up-line-or-search</b> and  <b>down-line-or-search</b>:  if in a multiline buffer they move up or down within the buffer, otherwise they search for a history line matching the start of the current line.  In this case, however, they search for a line which matches the current line up to the current cursor position, in the manner of  <b>history-beginning-search-backward</b> and <b>-forward</b>, rather than the first word on the line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>edit-command-line</b></dt>
<dd>
Edit the command line using your visual editor, as in <b>ksh</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>bindkey -M vicmd v edit-command-line</b><br/>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>history-search-end</b></dt>
<dd>
This function implements the widgets  <b>history-beginning-search-backward-end</b> and  <b>history-beginning-search-forward-end</b>.  These commands work by first calling the corresponding builtin widget (see `History Control' in  <i>zsh-betazle</i>(1)) and then moving the cursor to the end of the line.  The original cursor position is remembered and restored before calling the builtin widget a second time, so that the same search is repeated to look farther through the history.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Although you <b>autoload</b> only one function, the commands to use it are slightly different because it implements two widgets.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zle -N history-beginning-search-backward-end \ </b><br/>
<b>       history-search-end</b><br/>
<b>zle -N history-beginning-search-forward-end \ </b><br/>
<b>       history-search-end</b><br/>
<b>bindkey '\e^P' history-beginning-search-backward-end</b><br/>
<b>bindkey '\e^N' history-beginning-search-forward-end</b><br/>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>history-beginning-search-menu</b></dt>
<dd>
This function implements yet another form of history searching.  The text before the cursor is used to select lines from the history, as for  <b>history-beginning-search-backward</b> except that all matches are shown in a numbered menu.  Typing the appropriate digits inserts the full history line.  Note that leading zeroes must be typed (they are only shown when necessary for removing ambiguity).  The entire history is searched; there is no distinction between forwards and backwards.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
With a prefix argument, the search is not anchored to the start of the line; the string typed by the use may appear anywhere in the line in the history.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the widget name contains `<b>-end</b>' the cursor is moved to the end of the line inserted.  If the widget name contains ` <b>-space</b>' any space in the text typed is treated as a wildcard and can match anything (hence a leading space is equivalent to giving a prefix argument).  Both forms can be combined, for example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zle -N history-beginning-search-menu-space-end \ </b><br/>
<b>       history-beginning-search-menu</b><br/>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>history-pattern-search</b></dt>
<dd>
The function <b>history-pattern-search</b> implements widgets which prompt for a pattern with which to search the history backwards or forwards.  The pattern is in the usual zsh format, however the first character may be  <b>^</b> to anchor the search to the start of the line, and the last character may be  <b>$</b> to anchor the search to the end of the line.  If the search was not anchored to the end of the line the cursor is positioned just after the pattern found.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The commands to create bindable widgets are similar to those in the example immediately above:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>autoload -U history-pattern-search</b><br/>
<b>zle -N history-pattern-search-backward history-pattern-search</b><br/>
<b>zle -N history-pattern-search-forward history-pattern-search</b><br/>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>incarg</b></dt>
<dd>
Typing the keystrokes for this widget with the cursor placed on or to the left of an integer causes that integer to be incremented by one.  With a numeric prefix argument, the number is incremented by the amount of the argument (decremented if the prefix argument is negative).  The shell parameter  <b>incarg</b> may be set to change the default increment to something other than one.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>bindkey '^X+' incarg</b><br/>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>incremental-complete-word</b></dt>
<dd>
This allows incremental completion of a word.  After starting this command, a list of completion choices can be shown after every character you type, which you can delete with  <b>^H</b> or <b>DEL</b>.  Pressing return accepts the completion so far and returns you to normal editing (that is, the command line is  <i>not</i> immediately executed).  You can hit <b>TAB</b> to do normal completion,  <b>^G</b> to abort back to the state when you started, and  <b>^D</b> to list the matches.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This works only with the new function based completion system.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>bindkey '^Xi' incremental-complete-word</b><br/>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>insert-composed-char</b></dt>
<dd>
This function allows you to compose characters that don't appear on the keyboard to be inserted into the command line.  The command is followed by two keys corresponding to ASCII characters (there is no prompt).  For accented characters, the two keys are a base character followed by a code for the accent, while for other special characters the two characters together form a mnemonic for the character to be inserted.  The two-character codes are a subset of those given by RFC 1345 (see for example  <b>http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The function may optionally be followed by up to two characters which replace one or both of the characters read from the keyboard; if both characters are supplied, no input is read.  For example,  <b>insert-composed-char a:</b> can be used within a widget to insert an a with umlaut into the command line.  This has the advantages over use of a literal character that it is more portable.<div class="spacer">

For best results zsh should have been built with support for multibyte characters (configured with  <b>--enable-multibyte</b>); however, the function works for the limited range of characters available in single-byte character sets such as ISO-8859-1.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The character is converted into the local representation and inserted into the command line at the cursor position. (The conversion is done within the shell, using whatever facilities the C library provides.)  With a numeric argument, the character and its code are previewed in the status line<div class="spacer">
</div>
The function may be run outside zle in which case it prints the character (together with a newline) to standard output.  Input is still read from keystrokes.<div class="spacer">

The set of accented characters is reasonably complete up to Unicode character U+0180, the set of special characters less so.  However, it is very sporadic from that point.  Adding new characters is easy, however; see the function  <b>define-composed-chars</b>.  Please send any additions to  <b>zsh-workers@zsh.org</b>.<div class="spacer">

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>narrow-to-region</b> may be used as a widget or called as a function from a user-defined widget; by default, the text outside the editable area remains visible.  A  <b>recursive-edit</b> is performed and the original widening status is then restored.  Various options and arguments are available when it is called as a function.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The options <b>-p</b> <i>pretext</i> and <b>-P</b> <i>posttext</i> may be used to replace the text before and after the display for the duration of the function; either or both may be an empty string.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the option <b>-n</b> is also given, <i>pretext</i> or <i>posttext</i> will only be inserted if there is text before or after the region respectively which will be made invisible.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Two numeric arguments may be given which will be used instead of the cursor and mark positions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The option <b>-S</b> <i>statepm</i> is used to narrow according to the other options while saving the original state in the parameter with name  <i>statepm</i>, while the option <b>-R</b> <i>statepm</i> is used to restore the state from the parameter; note in both cases the  <i>name</i> of the parameter is required.  In the second case, other options and arguments are irrelevant.  When this method is used, no  <b>recursive-edit</b> is performed; the calling widget should call this function with the option  <b>-S</b>, perform its own editing on the command line or pass control to the user via ` <b>zle recursive-edit</b>', then call this function with the option  <b>-R</b>.  The argument <i>statepm</i> must be a suitable name for an ordinary parameter, except that parameters beginning with the prefix  <b>_ntr_</b> are reserved for use within  <b>narrow-to-region</b>.  Typically the parameter will be local to the calling function.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>narrow-to-region-invisible</b> is a simple widget which calls  <b>narrow-to-region</b> with arguments which replace any text outside the region with ` <b>...</b>'.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The display is restored (and the widget returns) upon any zle command which would usually cause the line to be accepted or aborted.  Hence an additional such command is required to accept or abort the current line.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The return status of both widgets is zero if the line was accepted, else non-zero.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here is a trivial example of a widget using this feature.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>local state</b><br/>
<b>narrow-to-region -p $'Editing restricted region\n' \ </b><br/>

<dt>
<b>predict-on</b></dt>
<dd>
This set of functions implements predictive typing using history search. After  <b>predict-on</b>, typing characters causes the editor to look backward in the history for the first line beginning with what you have typed so far.  After  <b>predict-off</b>, editing returns to normal for the line found. In fact, you often don't even need to use  <b>predict-off</b>, because if the line doesn't match something in the history, adding a key performs standard completion, and then inserts itself if no completions were found. However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to confuse prediction; see the  <b>toggle</b> style below.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
With the function based completion system (which is needed for this), you should be able to type  <b>TAB</b> at almost any point to advance the cursor to the next ``interesting'' character position (usually the end of the current word, but sometimes somewhere in the middle of the word).  And of course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you can accept with return, without needing to move the cursor to the end first.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first time <b>predict-on</b> is used, it creates several additional widget functions:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>delete-backward-and-predict</b></dt>
<dd>
Replaces the <b>backward-delete-char</b> widget.  You do not need to bind this yourself.</dd>

<b>read-from-minibuffer</b></dt>
<dd>
This is most useful when called as a function from inside a widget, but will work correctly as a widget in its own right.  It prompts for a value below the current command line; a value may be input using all of the standard zle operations (and not merely the restricted set available when executing, for example,  <b>execute-named-cmd</b>).  The value is then returned to the calling function in the parameter  <b>$REPLY</b> and the editing buffer restored to its previous state.  If the read was aborted by a keyboard break (typically  <b>^G</b>), the function returns status 1 and  <b>$REPLY</b> is not set.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt, otherwise ` <b>? </b>' is used.  If two arguments are supplied, they are the prompt and the initial value of  <b>$LBUFFER</b>, and if a third argument is given it is the initial value of  <b>$RBUFFER</b>.  This provides a default value and starting cursor placement.  Upon return the entire buffer is the value of  <b>$REPLY</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
One option is available: `<b>-k</b> <i>num</i>' specifies that <i>num</i> characters are to be read instead of a whole line.  The line editor is not invoked recursively in this case, so depending on the terminal settings the input may not be visible, and only the input keys are placed in  <b>$REPLY</b>, not the entire buffer.  Note that unlike the <b>read</b> builtin  <i>num</i> must be given; there is no default.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The name is a slight misnomer, as in fact the shell's own minibuffer is not used.  Hence it is still possible to call  <b>executed-named-cmd</b> and similar functions while reading a value.</div>

<b>replace-string-again</b>, <b>replace-pattern-again</b> The function  <b>replace-string</b> implements three widgets. If defined under the same name as the function, it prompts for two strings; the first (source) string will be replaced by the second everywhere it occurs in the line editing buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the widget name contains the word `<b>pattern</b>', for example by defining the widget using the command ` <b>zle -N replace-pattern</b>  <b>replace-string</b>', then the matching is performed using zsh patterns.  All zsh extended globbing patterns can be used in the source string; note that unlike filename generation the pattern does not need to match an entire word, nor do glob qualifiers have any effect.  In addition, the replacement string can contain parameter or command substitutions. Furthermore, a ` <b>&amp;</b>' in the replacement string will be replaced with the matched source string, and a backquoted digit ` <b>\</b><i>N</i>' will be replaced by the  <i>N</i>th parenthesised expression matched.  The form ` <b>\{</b><i>N</i><b>}</b>' may be used to protect the digit from following digits.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the widget instead contains the word `<b>regex</b>' (or `<b>regexp</b>'), then the matching is performed using regular expressions, respecting the setting of the option  <b>RE_MATCH_PCRE</b> (see the description of the function  <b>regexp-replace</b> below).  The special replacement facilities described above for pattern matching are available.<div class="spacer">
</div>
By default the previous source or replacement string will not be offered for editing.  However, this feature can be activated by setting the style  <b>edit-previous</b> in the context <b>:zle:</b><i>widget</i> (for example,  <b>:zle:replace-string</b>) to <b>true</b>.  In addition, a positive numeric argument forces the previous values to be offered, a negative or zero argument forces them not to be.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The function <b>replace-string-again</b> can be used to repeat the previous replacement; no prompting is done.  As with  <b>replace-string</b>, if the name of the widget contains the word ` <b>pattern</b>' or `<b>regex</b>', pattern or regular expression matching is performed, else a literal string replacement.  Note that the previous source and replacement text are the same whether pattern, regular expression or string matching is used.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, starting from the line:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>print This line contains fan and fond</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
and invoking <b>replace-pattern</b> with the source string ` <b>f(?)n</b>' and the replacement string ` <b>c\1r</b>' produces the not very useful line:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>print This line contains car and cord</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The range of the replacement string can be limited by using the  <b>narrow-to-region-invisible</b> widget.  One limitation of the current version is that  <b>undo</b> will cycle through changes to the replacement and source strings before undoing the replacement itself.</div>

This is similar to read-from-minibuffer in that it may be called as a function from a widget or as a widget of its own, and interactively reads input from the keyboard.  However, the input being typed is concealed and a string of asterisks (` <b>*</b>') is shown instead.  The value is saved in the parameter  <b>$INVISIBLE</b> to which a reference is inserted into the editing buffer at the restored cursor position.  If the read was aborted by a keyboard break (typically  <b>^G</b>) or another escape from editing such as  <b>push-line</b>, <b>$INVISIBLE</b> is set to empty and the original buffer is restored unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt, otherwise ` <b>Non-echoed text: </b>' is used (as in emacs).  If a second and third argument are supplied they are used to begin and end the reference to  <b>$INVISIBLE</b> that is inserted into the buffer.  The default is to open with  <b>${</b>, then <b>INVISIBLE</b>, and close with <b>}</b>, but many other effects are possible.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>smart-insert-last-word</b></dt>
<dd>
This function may replace the <b>insert-last-word</b> widget, like so:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zle -N insert-last-word smart-insert-last-word</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
With a numeric prefix, or when passed command line arguments in a call from another widget, it behaves like  <b>insert-last-word</b>, except that words in comments are ignored when  <b>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</b> is set.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Otherwise, the rightmost ``interesting'' word from the previous command is found and inserted.  The default definition of ``interesting'' is that the word contains at least one alphabetic character, slash, or backslash. This definition may be overridden by use of the  <b>match</b> style.  The context used to look up the style is the widget name, so usually the context is  <b>:insert-last-word</b>.  However, you can bind this function to different widgets to use different patterns:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zle -N insert-last-assignment smart-insert-last-word</b><br/>
<b>zstyle :insert-last-assignment match '[[:alpha:]][][[:alnum:]]#=*'</b><br/>
<b>bindkey '\e=' insert-last-assignment</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If no interesting word is found and the <b>auto-previous</b> style is set to a true value, the search continues upward through the history.  When  <b>auto-previous</b> is unset or false (the default), the widget must be invoked repeatedly in order to search earlier history lines.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>transpose-lines</b></dt>
<dd>
Only useful with a multi-line editing buffer; the lines here are lines within the current on-screen buffer, not history lines. The effect is similar to the function of the same name in Emacs.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Transpose the current line with the previous line and move the cursor to the start of the next line.  Repeating this (which can be done by providing a positive numeric prefix argument) has the effect of moving the line above the cursor down by a number of lines.<div class="spacer">
</div>
With a negative numeric prefix argument, requires two lines above the cursor.  These two lines are transposed and the cursor moved to the start of the previous line.  Using a numeric prefix less than -1 has the effect of moving the line above the cursor up by minus that number of lines.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>which-command</b></dt>
<dd>
This function is a drop-in replacement for the builtin widget  <b>which-command</b>.  It has enhanced behaviour, in that it correctly detects whether or not the command word needs to be expanded as an alias; if so, it continues tracing the command word from the expanded alias until it reaches the command that will be executed.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The style <b>whence</b> is available in the context <b>:zle:$WIDGET</b>; this may be set to an array to give the command and options that will be used to investigate the command word found.  The default is  <b>whence -c</b>.</div>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Utility Functions</h2> These functions are useful in constructing widgets.  They should be loaded with ` <b>autoload -U</b> <i>function</i>' and called as indicated from user-defined widgets.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>split-shell-arguments</b> This function splits the line currently being edited into shell arguments and whitespace.  The result is stored in the array  <b>reply</b>.  The array contains all the parts of the line in order, starting with any whitespace before the first argument, and finishing with any whitespace after the last argument.  Hence (so long as the option  <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is not set) whitespace is given by odd indices in the array and arguments by even indices.  Note that no stripping of quotes is done; joining together all the elements of  <b>reply</b> in order is guaranteed to produce the original line.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The parameter <b>REPLY</b> is set to the index of the word in <b>reply</b> which contains the character after the cursor, where the first element has index 1.  The parameter  <b>REPLY2</b> is set to the index of the character under the cursor in that word, where the first character has index 1.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Hence <b>reply</b>, <b>REPLY</b> and <b>REPLY2</b> should all be made local to the enclosing function.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the function <b>modify-current-argument</b>, described below, for an example of how to call this function.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>modify-current-argument</b> <i>expr-using-</i><b>$ARG</b></dt>
<dd>
This function provides a simple method of allowing user-defined widgets to modify the command line argument under the cursor (or immediately to the left of the cursor if the cursor is between arguments).  The argument should be an expression which when evaluated operates on the shell parameter  <b>ARG</b>, which will have been set to the command line argument under the cursor.  The expression should be suitably quoted to prevent it being evaluated too early.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, a user-defined widget containing the following code converts the characters in the argument under the cursor into all upper case:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>modify-current-argument '${(U)ARG}'</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following strips any quoting from the current word (whether backslashes or one of the styles of quotes), and replaces it with single quoting throughout:<div class="spacer">

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>modify-current-argument '${(qq)${(Q)ARG}}'</b><br/>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Styles</h2> The behavior of several of the above widgets can be controlled by the use of the  <b>zstyle</b> mechanism.  In particular, widgets that interact with the completion system pass along their context to any completions that they invoke.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>break-keys</b> This style is used by the  <b>incremental-complete-word</b> widget. Its value should be a pattern, and all keys matching this pattern will cause the widget to stop incremental completion without the key having any further effect. Like all styles used directly by  <b>incremental-complete-word</b>, this style is looked up using the context ` <b>:incremental</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>completer</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>incremental-complete-word</b> and <b>insert-and-predict</b> widgets set up their top-level context name before calling completion.  This allows one to define different sets of completer functions for normal completion and for these widgets.  For example, to use completion, approximation and correction for normal completion, completion and correction for incremental completion and only completion for prediction one could use:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':completion:*' completer \ </b><br/>
<b>        _complete _correct _approximate</b><br/>
<b>zstyle ':completion:incremental:*' completer \ </b><br/>
<b>        _complete _correct</b><br/>
<b>zstyle ':completion:predict:*' completer \ </b><br/>
<b>        _complete</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is a good idea to restrict the completers used in prediction, because they may be automatically invoked as you type.  The  <b>_list</b> and  <b>_menu</b> completers should never be used with prediction.  The  <b>_approximate</b>, <b>_correct</b>, <b>_expand</b>, and <b>_match</b> completers may be used, but be aware that they may change characters anywhere in the word behind the cursor, so you need to watch carefully that the result is what you intended.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>cursor</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>insert-and-predict</b> widget uses this style, in the context ` <b>:predict</b>', to decide where to place the cursor after completion has been tried.  Values are:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>complete</b> The cursor is left where it was when completion finished, but only if it is after a character equal to the one just inserted by the user.  If it is after another character, this value is the same as ` <b>key</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>key</b></dt>
<dd>
The cursor is left after the  <i>n</i>th occurrence of the character just inserted, where  <i>n</i> is the number of times that character appeared in the word before completion was attempted.  In short, this has the effect of leaving the cursor after the character just typed even if the completion code found out that no other characters need to be inserted at that position.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any other value for this style unconditionally leaves the cursor at the position where the completion code left it.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>list</b></dt>
<dd>
When using the <b>incremental-complete-word</b> widget, this style says if the matches should be listed on every key press (if they fit on the screen).  Use the context prefix ` <b>:completion:incremental</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>insert-and-predict</b> widget uses this style to decide if the completion should be shown even if there is only one possible completion. This is done if the value of this style is the string  <b>always</b>.  In this case the context is ` <b>:predict</b>' (<i>not</i> `<b>:completion:predict</b>').</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>match</b></dt>
<dd>
This style is used by <b>smart-insert-last-word</b> to provide a pattern (using full  <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> syntax) that matches an interesting word. The context is the name of the widget to which  <b>smart-insert-last-word</b> is bound (see above).  The default behavior of  <b>smart-insert-last-word</b> is equivalent to:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle :insert-last-word match '*[[:alpha:]/\\]*'</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, you might want to include words that contain spaces:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle :insert-last-word match '*[[:alpha:][:space:]/\\]*'</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Or include numbers as long as the word is at least two characters long:<div class="spacer">

<br/>
<b>zstyle :insert-last-word match '*([[:digit:]]?|[[:alpha:]/\\])*'</b><br/>

The above example causes redirections like &quot;2&gt;&quot; to be included.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>prompt</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>incremental-complete-word</b> widget shows the value of this style in the status line during incremental completion.  The string value may contain any of the following substrings in the manner of the  <b>PS1</b> and other prompt parameters:</dd>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

<dl>
<dt>
<b>%l</b></dt>
<dd>
When the <b>list</b> style is set, replaced by ` <b>...</b>' if the list of matches is too long to fit on the screen and with an empty string otherwise.  If the  <b>list</b> style is `false' or not set, ` <b>%l</b>' is always removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

Like `<b>break-keys</b>', this uses the `<b>:incremental</b>' context.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>stop-keys</b></dt>
<dd>
This style is used by the <b>incremental-complete-word</b> widget.  Its value is treated similarly to the one for the  <b>break-keys</b> style (and uses the same context: ` <b>:incremental</b>').  However, in this case all keys matching the pattern given as its value will stop incremental completion and will then execute their usual function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>toggle</b></dt>
<dd>
This boolean style is used by <b>predict-on</b> and its related widgets in the context ` <b>:predict</b>'.  If set to one of the standard `true' values, predictive typing is automatically toggled off in situations where it is unlikely to be useful, such as when editing a multi-line buffer or after moving into the middle of a line and then deleting a character.  The default is to leave prediction turned on until an explicit call to  <b>predict-off</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>verbose</b></dt>
<dd>
This boolean style is used by <b>predict-on</b> and its related widgets in the context ` <b>:predict</b>'.  If set to one of the standard `true' values, these widgets display a message below the prompt when the predictive state is toggled.  This is most useful in combination with the  <b>toggle</b> style. The default does not display these messages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>widget</b></dt>
<dd>
This style is similar to the <b>command</b> style: For widget functions that use  <b>zle</b> to call other widgets, this style can sometimes be used to override the widget which is called.

<h1>EXCEPTION HANDLING</h1> Two functions are provided to enable zsh to provide exception handling in a form that should be familiar from other languages.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>throw</b> <i>exception</i> The function  <b>throw</b> throws the named <i>exception</i>.  The name is an arbitrary string and is only used by the  <b>throw</b> and <b>catch</b> functions.  An exception is for the most part treated the same as a shell error, i.e. an unhandled exception will cause the shell to abort all processing in a function or script and to return to the top level in an interactive shell.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>catch</b> <i>exception-pattern</i></dt>
<dd>
The function <b>catch</b> returns status zero if an exception was thrown and the pattern  <i>exception-pattern</i> matches its name.  Otherwise it returns status 1.   <i>exception-pattern</i> is a standard shell pattern, respecting the current setting of the  <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> option.  An alias  <b>catch</b> is also defined to prevent the argument to the function from matching filenames, so patterns may be used unquoted.  Note that as exceptions are not fundamentally different from other shell errors it is possible to catch shell errors by using an empty string as the exception name.  The shell variable  <b>CAUGHT</b> is set by <b>catch</b> to the name of the exception caught.  It is possible to rethrow an exception by calling the  <b>throw</b> function again once an exception has been caught.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The functions are designed to be used together with the <b>always</b> construct described in  <i>zsh-betamisc</i>(1).  This is important as only this construct provides the required support for exceptions.  A typical example is as follows.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>{</b><br/>
<b>  # &quot;try&quot; block</b><br/>
<b>  # ... nested code here calls &quot;throw MyExcept&quot;</b><br/>
<b>} always {</b><br/>
<b>  # &quot;always&quot; block</b><br/>
<b>  if catch MyExcept; then</b><br/>
<b>    print &quot;Caught exception MyExcept&quot;</b><br/>
<b>  elif catch ''; then</b><br/>
<b>    print &quot;Caught a shell error.  Propagating...&quot;</b><br/>
<b>    throw ''</b><br/>
<b>  fi</b><br/>
<b>  # Other exceptions are not handled but may be caught further</b><br/>
<b>  # up the call stack.</b><br/>
<b>}</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If all exceptions should be caught, the following idiom might be preferable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>{</b><br/>
<b>  # ... nested code here throws an exception</b><br/>
<b>} always {</b><br/>
<b>  if catch *; then</b><br/>
<b>    case $CAUGHT in</b><br/>
<b>      (MyExcept)</b><br/>
<b>      print &quot;Caught my own exception&quot;</b><br/>
<b>      ;;</b><br/>
<b>      (*)</b><br/>
<b>      print &quot;Caught some other exception&quot;</b><br/>
<b>      ;;</b><br/>
<b>    esac</b><br/>
<b>  fi</b><br/>
<b>}</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In common with exception handling in other languages, the exception may be thrown by code deeply nested inside the `try' block.  However, note that it must be thrown inside the current shell, not in a subshell forked for a pipeline, parenthesised current-shell construct, or some form of command or process substitution.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The system internally uses the shell variable <b>EXCEPTION</b> to record the name of the exception between throwing and catching.  One drawback of this scheme is that if the exception is not handled the variable  <b>EXCEPTION</b> remains set and may be incorrectly recognised as the name of an exception if a shell error subsequently occurs.  Adding  <b>unset EXCEPTION</b> at the start of the outermost layer of any code that uses exception handling will eliminate this problem.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>MIME FUNCTIONS</h1> Three functions are available to provide handling of files recognised by extension, for example to dispatch a file  <b>text.ps</b> when executed as a command to an appropriate viewer.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>zsh-mime-setup</b> [ <b>-fv</b> ] [ <b>-l</b> [ <i>suffix ...</i> ] ]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>zsh-mime-handler [-l] </b><i>command arguments ...</i><b></b><i></i>  <i>These two functions use the files </i><b>~/.mime.types</b><i> and </i><b>/etc/mime.types</b><i>,</i>  <i>which associate types and extensions, as well as </i><b>~/.mailcap</b><i> and</i>  <i></i><b>/etc/mailcap</b><i> files, which associate types and the programs that</i>  <i>handle them.  These are provided on many systems with the Multimedia</i>  <i>Internet Mail Extensions.</i></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To enable the system, the function <b>zsh-mime-setup</b> should be autoloaded and run.  This allows files with extensions to be treated as executable; such files be completed by the function completion system. The function  <b>zsh-mime-handler</b> should not need to be called by the user.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The system works by setting up suffix aliases with `<b>alias -s</b>'. Suffix aliases already installed by the user will not be overwritten.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For suffixes defined in lower case, upper case variants will also automatically be handled (e.g.  <b>PDF</b> is automatically handled if handling for the suffix  <b>pdf</b> is defined), but not vice versa.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Repeated calls to <b>zsh-mime-setup</b> do not override the existing mapping between suffixes and executable files unless the option  <b>-f</b> is given.  Note, however, that this does not override existing suffix aliases assigned to handlers other than  <b>zsh-mime-handler</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Calling <b>zsh-mime-setup</b> with the option <b>-l</b> lists the existing mappings without altering them.  Suffixes to list (which may contain pattern characters that should be quoted from immediate interpretation on the command line) may be given as additional arguments, otherwise all suffixes are listed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Calling <b>zsh-mime-setup</b> with the option  <b>-v</b> causes verbose output to be shown during the setup operation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The system respects the <b>mailcap</b> flags <b>needsterminal</b> and  <b>copiousoutput</b>, see <i>mailcap</i>(4).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The functions use the following styles, which are defined with the  <b>zstyle</b> builtin command (see <i>zsh-betamodules</i>(1)).  They should be defined before  <b>zsh-mime-setup</b> is run.  The contexts used all start with  <b>:mime:</b>, with additional components in some cases. It is recommended that a trailing  <b>*</b> (suitably quoted) be appended to style patterns in case the system is extended in future.  Some examples are given below.<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>current-shell</b> If this boolean style is true, the mailcap handler for the context in question is run using the  <b>eval</b> builtin instead of by starting a new  <b>sh</b> process.  This is more efficient, but may not work in the occasional cases where the mailcap handler uses strict POSIX syntax.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>execute-as-is</b></dt>
<dd>
This style gives a list of patterns to be matched against files passed for execution with a handler program.  If the file matches the pattern, the entire command line is executed in its current form, with no handler.  This is useful for files which might have suffixes but nonetheless be executable in their own right.  If the style is not set, the pattern  <b>*(*) *(/)</b> is used; hence executable files are executed directly and not passed to a handler, and the option  <b>AUTO_CD</b> may be used to change to directories that happen to have MIME suffixes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>file-path</b></dt>
<dd>
Used if the style <b>find-file-in-path</b> is true for the same context. Set to an array of directories that are used for searching for the file to be handled; the default is the command path given by the special parameter  <b>path</b>.  The shell option <b>PATH_DIRS</b> is respected; if that is set, the appropriate path will be searched even if the name of the file to be handled as it appears on the command line contains a ` <b>/</b>'. The full context is  <b>:mime:.</b><i>suffix</i><b>:</b>, as described for the style  <b>handler</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>find-file-in-path</b></dt>
<dd>
If set, allows files whose names do not contain absolute paths to be searched for in the command path or the path specified by the  <b>file-path</b> style.  If the file is not found in the path, it is looked for locally (whether or not the current directory is in the path); if it is not found locally, the handler will abort unless the  <b>handle-nonexistent</b> style is set.  Files found in the path are tested as described for the style  <b>execute-as-is</b>. The full context is  <b>:mime:.</b><i>suffix</i><b>:</b>, as described for the style  <b>handler</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>flags</b></dt>
<dd>
Defines flags to go with a handler; the context is as for the  <b>handler</b> style, and the format is as for the flags in <b>mailcap</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>handle-nonexistent</b></dt>
<dd>
By default, arguments that don't correspond to files are not passed to the MIME handler in order to prevent it from intercepting commands found in the path that happen to have suffixes.  This style may be set to an array of extended glob patterns for arguments that will be passed to the handler even if they don't exist.  If it is not explicitly set it defaults to  <b>[[:alpha:]]#:/*</b> which allows URLs to be passed to the MIME handler even though they don't exist in that format in the file system. The full context is  <b>:mime:.</b><i>suffix</i><b>:</b>, as described for the style  <b>handler</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>handler</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies a handler for a suffix; the suffix is given by the context as  <b>:mime:.</b><i>suffix</i><b>:</b>, and the format of the handler is exactly that in  <b>mailcap</b>.  Note in particular the `<b>.</b>' and trailing colon to distinguish this use of the context.  This overrides any handler specified by the  <b>mailcap</b> files.  If the handler requires a terminal, the  <b>flags</b> style should be set to include the word <b>needsterminal</b>, or if the output is to be displayed through a pager (but not if the handler is itself a pager), it should include  <b>copiousoutput</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>mailcap</b></dt>
<dd>
A list of files in the format of <b>~/.mailcap</b> and  <b>/etc/mailcap</b> to be read during setup, replacing the default list which consists of those two files.  The context is  <b>:mime:</b>. A  <b>+</b> in the list will be replaced by the default files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>mailcap-priorities</b></dt>
<dd>
This style is used to resolve multiple mailcap entries for the same MIME type.  It consists of an array of the following elements, in descending order of priority; later entries will be used if earlier entries are unable to resolve the entries being compared.  If none of the tests resolve the entries, the first entry encountered is retained.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">

<dd>
This style is used when the keyword <b>flags</b> is encountered in the list of tests specified by the  <b>mailcap-priorities</b> style.

<b>mime-types</b></dt>
<dd>
A list of files in the format of <b>~/.mime.types</b> and  <b>/etc/mime.types</b> to be read during setup, replacing the default list which consists of those two files.  The context is  <b>:mime:</b>. A  <b>+</b> in the list will be replaced by the default files.</dd>

Examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle ':mime:*' mailcap ~/.mailcap /usr/local/etc/mailcap</b><br/>
<b>zstyle ':mime:.txt:' handler less %s</b><br/>
<b>zstyle ':mime:.txt:' flags needsterminal</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <b>zsh-mime-setup</b> is subsequently run, it will look for  <b>mailcap</b> entries in the two files given.  Files of suffix <b>.txt</b> will be handled by running ` <b>less</b> <i>file.txt</i>'.  The flag  <b>needsterminal</b> is set to show that this program must run attached to a terminal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As there are several steps to dispatching a command, the following should be checked if attempting to execute a file by extension  <b>.</b><i>ext</i> does not have the expected effect.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command `<b>alias -s</b> <i>ext</i>' should show ` <b>ps=zsh-mime-handler</b>'.  If it shows something else, another suffix alias was already installed and was not overwritten.  If it shows nothing, no handler was installed:  this is most likely because no handler was found in the  <b>.mime.types</b> and <b>mailcap</b> combination for  <b>.ext</b> files.  In that case, appropriate handling should be added to  <b>~/.mime.types</b> and <b>mailcap</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the extension is handled by <b>zsh-mime-handler</b> but the file is not opened correctly, either the handler defined for the type is incorrect, or the flags associated with it are in appropriate.  Running  <b>zsh-mime-setup -l</b> will show the handler and, if there are any, the flags.  A  <b>%s</b> in the handler is replaced by the file (suitably quoted if necessary).  Check that the handler program listed lists and can be run in the way shown.  Also check that the flags  <b>needsterminal</b> or  <b>copiousoutput</b> are set if the handler needs to be run under a terminal; the second flag is used if the output should be sent to a pager. An example of a suitable  <b>mailcap</b> entry for such a program is:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>text/html; /usr/bin/lynx '%s'; needsterminal</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Running `<b>zsh-mime-handler -l</b> <i>command line</i>' prints the command line that would be executed, simplified to remove the effect of any flags, and quoted so that the output can be run as a complete zsh command line.  This is used by the completion system to decide how to complete after a file handled by  <b>zsh-mime-setup</b>.</div>

<h1>MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS</h1><dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>zcalc</b> [ <i>expression</i> ... ] A reasonably powerful calculator based on zsh's arithmetic evaluation facility.  The syntax is similar to that of formulae in most programming languages; see the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' in  <i>zsh-betamisc</i>(1) for details.  The mathematical library  <b>zsh/mathfunc</b> will be loaded if it is available; see the section `The zsh/mathfunc Module' in  <i>zsh-betamodules</i>(1).  The mathematical functions correspond to the raw system libraries, so trigonometric functions are evaluated using radians, and so on.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each line typed is evaluated as an expression.  The prompt shows a number, which corresponds to a positional parameter where the result of that calculation is stored.  For example, the result of the calculation on the line preceded by ` <b>4&gt; </b>' is available as <b>$4</b>.  The last value calculated is available as  <b>ans</b>.  Full command line editing, including the history of previous calculations, is available; the history is saved in the file  <b>~/.zcalc_history</b>.  To exit, enter a blank line or type `<b>:q</b>' on its own (` <b>q</b>' is allowed for historical compatibility).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If arguments are given to <b>zcalc</b> on start up, they are used to prime the first few positional parameters.  A visual indication of this is given when the calculator starts.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The constants <b>PI</b> (3.14159...) and <b>E</b> (2.71828...) are provided. Parameter assignment is possible, but note that all parameters will be put into the global namespace.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The output base can be initialised by passing the option `<b>-#</b><i>base</i>', for example ` <b>zcalc -#16</b>' (the `<b>#</b>' may have to be quoted, depending on the globbing options set).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The prompt is configurable via the parameter <b>ZCALCPROMPT</b>, which undergoes standard prompt expansion.  The index of the current entry is stored locally in the first element of the array  <b>psvar</b>, which can be referred to in  <b>ZCALCPROMPT</b> as `<b>%1v</b>'.  The default prompt is ` <b>%1v&gt; </b>'.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A few special commands are available; these are introduced by a colon. For backward compatibility, the colon may be omitted for certain commands.  Completion is available if  <b>compinit</b> has been run.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The output precision may be specified within zcalc by special commands familiar from many calculators.<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>:norm</b> The default output format.  It corresponds to the printf  <b>%g</b> specification.  Typically this shows six decimal digits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>:sci</b> <i>digits</i></dt>
<dd>
Scientific notation, corresponding to the printf <b>%g</b> output format with the precision given by  <i>digits</i>.  This produces either fixed point or exponential notation depending on the value output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>:fix</b> <i>digits</i></dt>
<dd>
Fixed point notation, corresponding to the printf <b>%f</b> output format with the precision given by  <i>digits</i>.</dd>

<b>:eng</b> <i>digits</i></dt>
<dd>
Exponential notation, corresponding to the printf <b>%E</b> output format with the precision given by  <i>digits</i>.</dd>

Other special commands:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>:!</b><i>line...</i> Execute  <i>line...</i> as a normal shell command line.  Note that it is executed in the context of the function, i.e. with local variables. Space is optional after  <b>:!</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>:local</b> <i>arg</i> ...</dt>
<dd>
Declare variables local to the function.  Note that certain variables are used by the function for its own purposes.  Other variables may be used, too, but they will be taken from or put into the global scope.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<b>:function</b> <i>name</i> [ <i>body</i> ]</dt>

Define a mathematical function or (with no <i>body</i>) delete it. The function is defined using  <b>zmathfuncdef</b>, see below.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">

<b>function cube $1 * $1 * $1</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
defines a function to cube the sole argument.</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>[#</b><i>base</i><b>]</b></dt>
<dd>
This is not a special command, rather part of normal arithmetic syntax; however, when this form appears on a line by itself the default output radix is set to  <i>base</i>.  Use, for example, `<b>[#16]</b>' to display hexadecimal output preceded by an indication of the base, or ` <b>[##16]</b>' just to display the raw number in the given base.  Bases themselves are always specified in decimal. ` <b>[#]</b>' restores the normal output format. Note that setting an output base suppresses floating point output; use ` <b>[#]</b>' to return to normal operation.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the comments in the function for a few extra tips.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
With two arguments, define a mathematical function named <i>mathfunc</i> which can be used in any form of arithmetic evaluation.   <i>body</i> is a mathematical expression to implement the function.  It may contain references to position parameters  <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b>, ... to refer to mandatory parameters and  <b>${1:-</b><i>defvalue</i><b>}</b> ... to refer to optional parameters.  Note that the forms must be strictly adhered to for the function to calculate the correct number of arguments.  The implementation is held in a shell function named  <b>zsh_math_func_</b><i>mathfunc</i>; usually the user will not need to refer to the shell function directly.  Any existing function of the same name is silently replaced.<div class="spacer">
</div>
With one argument, remove the mathematical function <i>mathfunc</i> as well as the shell function implementation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
With no arguments, list all <i>mathfunc</i> functions in a form suitable for restoring the definition. The functions have not necessarily been defined by  <b>zmathfuncdef</b>.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>USER CONFIGURATION FUNCTIONS</h1> The  <b>zsh/newuser</b> module comes with a function to aid in configuring shell options for new users.  If the module is installed, this function can also be run by hand.  It is available even if the module's default behaviour, namely running the function for a new user logging in without startup files, is inhibited.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>zsh-newuser-install</b> [ <b>-f</b> ] The function presents the user with various options for customizing their initialization scripts.  Currently only  <b>~/.zshrc</b> is handled.  <b>$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc</b> is used instead if the parameter <b>ZDOTDIR</b> is set; this provides a way for the user to configure a file without altering an existing  <b>.zshrc</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
By default the function exits immediately if it finds any of the files  <b>.zshenv</b>, <b>.zprofile</b>, <b>.zshrc</b>, or <b>.zlogin</b> in the appropriate directory.  The option  <b>-f</b> is required in order to force the function to continue.  Note this may happen even if  <b>.zshrc</b> itself does not exist.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As currently configured, the function will exit immediately if the user has root privileges; this behaviour cannot be overridden.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Once activated, the function's behaviour is supposed to be self-explanatory.  Menus are present allowing the user to alter the value of options and parameters.  Suggestions for improvements are always welcome.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the script exits, the user is given the opportunity to save the new file or not; changes are not irreversible until this point.  However, the script is careful to restrict changes to the file only to a group marked by the lines ` <b># Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install</b>' and ` <b># End of lines configured by zsh-newuser-install</b>'.  In addition, the old version of  <b>.zshrc</b> is saved to a file with the suffix  <b>.zni</b> appended.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the function edits an existing <b>.zshrc</b>, it is up to the user to ensure that the changes made will take effect.  For example, if control usually returns early from the existing  <b>.zshrc</b> the lines will not be executed; or a later initialization file may override options or parameters, and so on.  The function itself does not attempt to detect any such conflicts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OTHER FUNCTIONS</h1> There are a large number of helpful functions in the  <b>Functions/Misc</b> directory of the zsh distribution.  Most are very simple and do not require documentation here, but a few are worthy of special mention.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Descriptions</h2><dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>colors</b> This function initializes several associative arrays to map color names to (and from) the ANSI standard eight-color terminal codes.  These are used by the prompt theme system (see above).  You seldom should need to run  <b>colors</b> more than once.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The eight base colors are: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.  Each of these has codes for foreground and background.  In addition there are eight intensity attributes: bold, faint, standout, underline, blink, reverse, and conceal.  Finally, there are six codes used to negate attributes: none (reset all attributes to the defaults), normal (neither bold nor faint), no-standout, no-underline, no-blink, and no-reverse.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some terminals do not support all combinations of colors and intensities.<div class="spacer">

<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
color</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
colour Map all the color names to their integer codes, and integer codes to the color names.  The eight base names map to the foreground color codes, as do names prefixed with ` <b>fg-</b>', such as `<b>fg-red</b>'.  Names prefixed with ` <b>bg-</b>', such as `<b>bg-blue</b>', refer to the background codes.  The reverse mapping from code to color yields base name for foreground codes and the  <b>bg-</b> form for backgrounds.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Although it is a misnomer to call them `colors', these arrays also map the other fourteen attributes from names to codes and codes to names.</div>

Same as <b>zed -f</b>.  This function does not appear in the zsh distribution, but can be created by linking  <b>zed</b> to the name <b>fned</b> in some directory in your  <b>fpath</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>is-at-least</b> <i>needed</i> [ <i>present</i> ]</dt>
<dd>
Perform a greater-than-or-equal-to comparison of two strings having the format of a zsh version number; that is, a string of numbers and text with segments separated by dots or dashes.  If the  <i>present</i> string is not provided,  <b>$ZSH_VERSION</b> is used.  Segments are paired left-to-right in the two strings with leading non-number parts ignored.  If one string has fewer segments than the other, the missing segments are considered zero.</dd>

<b>nslookup</b> [ <i>arg</i> ... ]</dt>
<dd>
This wrapper function for the <b>nslookup</b> command requires the  <b>zsh/zpty</b> module (see  <i>zsh-betamodules</i>(1)).  It behaves exactly like the standard <b>nslookup</b> except that it provides customizable prompts (including a right-side prompt) and completion of nslookup commands, host names, etc. (if you use the function-based completion system).  Completion styles may be set with the context prefix ` <b>:completion:nslookup</b>'.</dd>

<b>regexp-replace</b> <i>var</i> <i>regexp</i> <i>replace</i></dt>
<dd>
Use regular expressions to perform a global search and replace operation on a variable.  If the option  <b>RE_MATCH_PCRE</b> is not set, POSIX extended regular expressions are used, else Perl-compatible regular expressions (this requires the shell to be linked against the  <b>pcre</b> library).</dd>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">

<i>var</i> is the name of the variable containing the string to be matched. The variable will be modified directly by the function.  The variables  <b>MATCH</b>, <b>MBEGIN</b>, <b>MEND</b>, <b>match</b>, <b>mbegin</b>, <b>mend</b> should be avoided as these are used by the regular expression code.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>regexp</i> is the regular expression to match against the string.<div class="spacer">

In the discussion which follows, if <i>cmd</i> is a file system path, it is first reduced to its rightmost component (the file name).<div class="spacer">

Help is first sought by looking for a file named <i>cmd</i> in the directory named by the  <b>HELPDIR</b> parameter.  If no file is found, an assistant function, alias, or command named  <b>run-help-</b><i>cmd</i><b></b><i> is sought.  If</i>  <i>found, the assistant is executed with the rest of the current command line</i>  <i>(everything after the command name </i><i>cmd</i><i>) as its arguments.

The previous editor state is restored when you quit the game (by pressing ` <b>q</b>') or when you lose.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you quit in the middle of a game, the next invocation of the <b>tetris</b> widget will continue where you left off.  If you lost, it will start a new game.</div>

<b>zargs</b> [ <i>option</i> ... <b>-</b><b>-</b> ] [ <i>input</i> ... ] [ <b>-</b><b>-</b> <i>command</i> [ <i>arg</i> ... ] ]</dt>
<dd>
This function works like GNU xargs, except that instead of reading lines of arguments from the standard input, it takes them from the command line. This is useful because zsh, especially with recursive glob operators, often can construct a command line for a shell function that is longer than can be accepted by an external command.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>option</i> list represents options of the <b>zargs</b> command itself, which are the same as those of  <b>xargs</b>.  The <i>input</i> list is the collection of strings (often file names) that become the arguments of the  <b>command</b>, analogous to the standard input of <b>xargs</b>.  Finally, the  <i>arg</i> list consists of those arguments (usually options) that are passed to the  <i>command</i> each time it runs.  The <i>arg</i> list precedes the elements from the  <b>input</b> list in each run.  If no <i>command</i> is provided, then no  <i>arg</i> list may be provided, and in that event the default command is ` <b>print</b>' with arguments `<b>-r -</b><b>-</b>'.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, to get a long <b>ls</b> listing of all plain files in the current directory or its subdirectories:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>autoload -U zargs</b><br/>
<b>zargs -- **/*(.) -- ls -l</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that `<b>-</b><b>-</b>' is used both to mark the end of the <i>option</i> list and to mark the end of the  <i>input</i> list, so it must appear twice whenever the  <i>input</i> list may be empty.  If there is guaranteed to be at least one  <i>input</i> and the first <i>input</i> does not begin with a ` <b>-</b>', then the first `<b>-</b><b>-</b>' may be omitted.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the event that the string `<b>-</b><b>-</b>' is or may be an <i>input</i>, the  <b>-e</b> option may be used to change the end-of-inputs marker.  Note that this does  <i>not</i> change the end-of-options marker.  For example, to use ` <b>..</b>' as the marker:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zargs -e.. -- **/*(.) .. ls -l</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is a good choice in that example because no plain file can be named ` <b>..</b>', but the best end-marker depends on the circumstances.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For details of the other <b>zargs</b> options, see <i>xargs</i>(1) or run  <b>zargs</b> with the <b>-</b><b>-help</b> option.</div>

<b>zed -b</b> This function uses the ZLE editor to edit a file or function.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Only one <i>name</i> argument is allowed. If the  <b>-f</b> option is given, the name is taken to be that of a function; if the function is marked for autoloading,  <b>zed</b> searches for it in the  <b>fpath</b> and loads it.  Note that functions edited this way are installed into the current shell, but  <i>not</i> written back to the autoload file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Without <b>-f</b>, <i>name</i> is the path name of the file to edit, which need not exist; it is created on write, if necessary.<div class="spacer">
</div>
While editing, the function sets the main keymap to <b>zed</b> and the vi command keymap to  <b>zed-vicmd</b>.  These will be copied from the existing  <b>main</b> and <b>vicmd</b> keymaps if they do not exist the first time <b>zed</b> is run.  They can be used to provide special key bindings used only in zed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If it creates the keymap, <b>zed</b> rebinds the return key to insert a line break and ` <b>^X^W</b>' to accept the edit in the <b>zed</b> keymap, and binds ` <b>ZZ</b>' to accept the edit in the <b>zed-vicmd</b> keymap.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The bindings alone can be installed by running `<b>zed -b</b>'.  This is suitable for putting into a startup file.  Note that, if rerun, this will overwrite the existing  <b>zed</b> and <b>zed-vicmd</b> keymaps.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Completion is available, and styles may be set with the context prefix ` <b>:completion:zed</b>'.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A zle widget <b>zed-set-file-name</b> is available.  This can be called by name from within zed using ` <b>\ex zed-set-file-name</b>' (note, however, that because of zed's rebindings you will have to type  <b>^j</b> at the end instead of the return key), or can be bound to a key in either of the  <b>zed</b> or  <b>zed-vicmd</b> keymaps after `<b>zed -b</b>' has been run.  When the widget is called, it prompts for a new name for the file being edited.  When zed exits the file will be written under that name and the original file will be left alone.  The widget has no effect with ` <b>zed -f</b>'.<div class="spacer">
</div>
While <b>zed-set-file-name</b> is running, zed uses the keymap  <b>zed-normal-keymap</b>, which is linked from the main keymap in effect at the time zed initialised its bindings.  (This is to make the return key operate normally.)  The result is that if the main keymap has been changed, the widget won't notice.  This is not a concern for most users.</div>

<b>zmv</b> [ <b>-finqQsvwW</b> ] [ -C | -L | -M | -p <i>program</i> ] [ -o <i>optstring</i> ] <i>srcpat</i> <i>dest</i></dt>
<dd>
Move (usually, rename) files matching the pattern <i>srcpat</i> to corresponding files having names of the form given by  <i>dest</i>, where  <i>srcpat</i> contains parentheses surrounding patterns which will be replaced in turn by $1, $2, ... in  <i>dest</i>.  For example,</dd>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zmv '(*).lis' '$1.txt'</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">

renames `<b>foo.lis</b>' to `<b>foo.txt</b>', `<b>my.old.stuff.lis</b>' to ` <b>my.old.stuff.txt</b>', and so on.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The pattern is always treated as an <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> pattern.  Any file whose name is not changed by the substitution is simply ignored.  Any error (a substitution resulted in an empty string, two substitutions gave the same result, the destination was an existing regular file and  <b>-f</b> was not given) causes the entire function to abort without doing anything.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Options:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-f</b></dt>
<dd>
Force overwriting of destination files.  Not currently passed down to the  <b>mv</b>/<b>cp</b>/<b>ln</b> command due to vagaries of implementations (but you can use  <b>-o-f</b> to do that).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-i</b></dt>
<dd>
Interactive: show each line to be executed and ask the user whether to execute it.  `Y' or `y' will execute it, anything else will skip it.  Note that you just need to type one character.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>-n</b></dt>
<dd>
No execution: print what would happen, but don't do it.</dd>

<b>-q</b></dt>
<dd>
Turn bare glob qualifiers off: now assumed by default, so this has no effect.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-p</b> <i>program</i></dt>
<dd>
Call <i>program</i> instead of <b>cp</b>, <b>ln</b> or  <b>mv</b>.  Whatever it does, it should at least understand the form ` <i>program</i> <b>-</b><b>-</b> <i>oldname</i> <i>newname</i>' where  <i>oldname</i> and <i>newname</i> are filenames generated by <b>zmv</b>.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>-o</b> <i>optstring</i></dt>
<dd>
The <i>optstring</i> is split into words and passed down verbatim to the  <b>cp</b>, <b>ln</b> or <b>mv</b> command called to perform the work.  It should probably begin with a ` <b>-</b>'.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>zstyle+</b> <i>context</i> <i>style</i> <i>value</i> [ + <i>subcontext</i> <i>style</i> <i>value</i> ... ]</dt>
<dd>
This makes defining styles a bit simpler by using a single `<b>+</b>' as a special token that allows you to append a context name to the previously used context name.  Like this:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zstyle+ ':foo:bar' style1 value1 \ </b><br/>
<b>       +':baz'     style2 value2 \ </b><br/>
<b>       +':frob'    style3 value3</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This defines `style1' with `value1' for the context <b>:foo:bar</b> as usual, but it also defines `style2' with `value2' for the context  <b>:foo:bar:baz</b> and `style3' with `value3' for <b>:foo:bar:frob</b>.  Any  <i>subcontext</i> may be the empty string to re-use the first context unchanged.</div>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Styles</h2><dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>insert-tab</b> The  <b>zed</b> function <i>sets</i> this style in context `<b>:completion:zed:*</b>' to turn off completion when  <b>TAB</b> is typed at the beginning of a line. You may override this by setting your own value for this context and style.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>pager</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>nslookup</b> function looks up this style in the context ` <b>:nslookup</b>' to determine the program used to display output that does not fit on a single screen.</dd>
