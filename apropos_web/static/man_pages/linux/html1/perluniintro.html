<h1>NAME</h1> perluniintro - Perl Unicode introduction</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document gives a general idea of Unicode and how to use Unicode in Perl.  See &quot;Further Resources&quot; for references to more in-depth treatments of Unicode.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode</h2> Unicode is a character set standard which plans to codify all of the writing systems of the world, plus many other symbols.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 are coordinated standards that unify almost all other modern character set standards, covering more than 80 writing systems and hundreds of languages, including all commercially-important modern languages.  All characters in the largest Chinese, Japanese, and Korean dictionaries are also encoded. The standards will eventually cover almost all characters in more than 250 writing systems and thousands of languages. Unicode 1.0 was released in October 1991, and 6.0 in October 2010.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A Unicode <i>character</i> is an abstract entity.  It is not bound to any particular integer width, especially not to the C language &quot;char&quot;. Unicode is language-neutral and display-neutral: it does not encode the language of the text, and it does not generally define fonts or other graphical layout details.  Unicode operates on characters and on text built from those characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unicode defines characters like &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A&quot; or &quot;GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA&quot; and unique numbers for the characters, in this case 0x0041 and 0x03B1, respectively.  These unique numbers are called  <i>code points</i>.  A code point is essentially the position of the character within the set of all possible Unicode characters, and thus in Perl, the term  <i>ordinal</i> is often used interchangeably with it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Unicode standard prefers using hexadecimal notation for the code points.  If numbers like 0x0041 are unfamiliar to you, take a peek at a later section, &quot;Hexadecimal Notation&quot;.  The Unicode standard uses the notation &quot;U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A&quot;, to give the hexadecimal code point and the normative name of the character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unicode also defines various <i>properties</i> for the characters, like &quot;uppercase&quot; or &quot;lowercase&quot;, &quot;decimal digit&quot;, or &quot;punctuation&quot;; these properties are independent of the names of the characters. Furthermore, various operations on the characters like uppercasing, lowercasing, and collating (sorting) are defined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A Unicode <i>logical</i> &quot;character&quot; can actually consist of more than one internal  <i>actual</i> &quot;character&quot; or code point.  For Western languages, this is adequately modelled by a  <i>base character</i> (like &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A&quot;) followed by one or more  <i>modifiers</i> (like &quot;COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT&quot;).  This sequence of base character and modifiers is called a  <i>combining character</i>  <i>sequence</i>.  Some non-western languages require more complicated models, so Unicode created the  <i>grapheme cluster</i> concept, which was later further refined into the  <i>extended grapheme cluster</i>.  For example, a Korean Hangul syllable is considered a single logical character, but most often consists of three actual Unicode characters: a leading consonant followed by an interior vowel followed by a trailing consonant.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Whether to call these extended grapheme clusters &quot;characters&quot; depends on your point of view. If you are a programmer, you probably would tend towards seeing each element in the sequences as one unit, or &quot;character&quot;.  However from the user's point of view, the whole sequence could be seen as one &quot;character&quot; since that's probably what it looks like in the context of the user's language.  In this document, we take the programmer's point of view: one &quot;character&quot; is one Unicode code point.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For some combinations of base character and modifiers, there are  <i>precomposed</i> characters.  There is a single character equivalent, for example, to the sequence &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A&quot; followed by &quot;COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT&quot;.  It is called  &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE&quot;.  These precomposed characters are, however, only available for some combinations, and are mainly meant to support round-trip conversions between Unicode and legacy standards (like ISO 8859).  Using sequences, as Unicode does, allows for needing fewer basic building blocks (code points) to express many more potential grapheme clusters.  To support conversion between equivalent forms, various  <i>normalization</i>  <i>forms</i> are also defined.  Thus, &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE&quot; is in  <i>Normalization Form Composed</i>, (abbreviated NFC), and the sequence &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A&quot; followed by &quot;COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT&quot; represents the same character in  <i>Normalization Form Decomposed</i> (NFD).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Because of backward compatibility with legacy encodings, the &quot;a unique number for every character&quot; idea breaks down a bit: instead, there is &quot;at least one number for every character&quot;.  The same character could be represented differently in several legacy encodings.  The converse is not also true: some code points do not have an assigned character.  Firstly, there are unallocated code points within otherwise used blocks.  Secondly, there are special Unicode control characters that do not represent true characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A common myth about Unicode is that it is &quot;16-bit&quot;, that is, Unicode is only represented as 0x10000 (or 65536) characters from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.   <b>This is untrue.</b>  Since Unicode 2.0 (July 1996), Unicode has been defined all the way up to 21 bits (0x10FFFF), and since Unicode 3.1 (March 2001), characters have been defined beyond 0xFFFF.  The first 0x10000 characters are called the  <i>Plane 0</i>, or the <i>Basic Multilingual Plane</i> (BMP).  With Unicode 3.1, 17 (yes, seventeen) planes in all were defined--but they are nowhere near full of defined characters, yet.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Another myth is about Unicode blocks--that they have something to do with languages--that each block would define the characters used by a language or a set of languages.   <b>This is also untrue.</b> The division into blocks exists, but it is almost completely accidental--an artifact of how the characters have been and still are allocated.  Instead, there is a concept called  <i>scripts</i>, which is more useful: there is &quot;Latin&quot; script, &quot;Greek&quot; script, and so on.  Scripts usually span varied parts of several blocks.  For more information about scripts, see &quot;Scripts&quot; in perlunicode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Unicode code points are just abstract numbers.  To input and output these abstract numbers, the numbers must be  <i>encoded</i> or  <i>serialised</i> somehow.  Unicode defines several <i>character encoding</i>  <i>forms</i>, of which <i>UTF-8</i> is perhaps the most popular.  UTF-8 is a variable length encoding that encodes Unicode characters as 1 to 6 bytes.  Other encodings include UTF-16 and UTF-32 and their big- and little-endian variants (UTF-8 is byte-order independent) The ISO/IEC 10646 defines the UCS-2 and UCS-4 encoding forms.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For more information about encodings--for instance, to learn what  <i>surrogates</i> and <i>byte order marks</i> (BOMs) are--see perlunicode.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Perl's Unicode Support</h2> Starting from Perl 5.6.0, Perl has had the capacity to handle Unicode natively.  Perl 5.8.0, however, is the first recommended release for serious Unicode work.  The maintenance release 5.6.1 fixed many of the problems of the initial Unicode implementation, but for example regular expressions still do not work with Unicode in 5.6.1. Perl 5.14.0 is the first release where Unicode support is (almost) seamlessly integrable without some gotchas (the exception being some differences in quotemeta).   To enable this seamless support, you should &quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot; (which is automatically selected if you &quot;use 5.012&quot; or higher).  See feature. (5.14 also fixes a number of bugs and departures from the Unicode standard.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Before Perl 5.8.0, the use of &quot;use utf8&quot; was used to declare that operations in the current block or file would be Unicode-aware. This model was found to be wrong, or at least clumsy: the &quot;Unicodeness&quot; is now carried with the data, instead of being attached to the operations. Starting with Perl 5.8.0, only one case remains where an explicit &quot;use utf8&quot; is needed: if your Perl script itself is encoded in UTF-8, you can use UTF-8 in your identifier names, and in string and regular expression literals, by saying &quot;use utf8&quot;.  This is not the default because scripts with legacy 8-bit data in them would break.  See utf8.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Perl's Unicode Model</h2> Perl supports both pre-5.6 strings of eight-bit native bytes, and strings of Unicode characters.  The general principle is that Perl tries to keep its data as eight-bit bytes for as long as possible, but as soon as Unicodeness cannot be avoided, the data is transparently upgraded to Unicode.  Prior to Perl 5.14, the upgrade was not completely transparent (see &quot;The &quot;Unicode Bug&quot;&quot; in perlunicode), and for backwards compatibility, full transparency is not gained unless &quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot; (see feature) or &quot;use 5.012&quot; (or higher) is selected.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Internally, Perl currently uses either whatever the native eight-bit character set of the platform (for example Latin-1) is, defaulting to UTF-8, to encode Unicode strings. Specifically, if all code points in the string are 0xFF or less, Perl uses the native eight-bit character set.  Otherwise, it uses UTF-8.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A user of Perl does not normally need to know nor care how Perl happens to encode its internal strings, but it becomes relevant when outputting Unicode strings to a stream without a PerlIO layer (one with the &quot;default&quot; encoding).  In such a case, the raw bytes used internally (the native character set or UTF-8, as appropriate for each string) will be used, and a &quot;Wide character&quot; warning will be issued if those strings contain a character beyond 0x00FF.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
      perl -e 'print &quot;\x{DF}\n&quot;, &quot;\x{0100}\x{DF}\n&quot;'<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
produces a fairly useless mixture of native bytes and UTF-8, as well as a warning:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
     Wide character in print at ...<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To output UTF-8, use the &quot;:encoding&quot; or &quot;:utf8&quot; output layer.  Prepending<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
      binmode(STDOUT, &quot;:utf8&quot;);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
to this sample program ensures that the output is completely UTF-8, and removes the program's warning.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can enable automatic UTF-8-ification of your standard file handles, default &quot;open()&quot; layer, and @ARGV by using either the &quot;-C&quot; command line switch or the &quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot; environment variable, see perlrun for the documentation of the &quot;-C&quot; switch.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that this means that Perl expects other software to work the same way: if Perl has been led to believe that STDIN should be UTF-8, but then STDIN coming in from another command is not UTF-8, Perl will likely complain about the malformed UTF-8.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All features that combine Unicode and I/O also require using the new PerlIO feature.  Almost all Perl 5.8 platforms do use PerlIO, though: you can see whether yours is by running &quot;perl -V&quot; and looking for &quot;useperlio=define&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode and EBCDIC</h2> Perl 5.8.0 also supports Unicode on EBCDIC platforms.  There, Unicode support is somewhat more complex to implement since additional conversions are needed at every step.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Later Perl releases have added code that will not work on EBCDIC platforms, and no one has complained, so the divergence has continued.  If you want to run Perl on an EBCDIC platform, send email to perlbug@perl.org<div class="spacer">
</div>
On EBCDIC platforms, the internal Unicode encoding form is UTF-EBCDIC instead of UTF-8.  The difference is that as UTF-8 is &quot;ASCII-safe&quot; in that ASCII characters encode to UTF-8 as-is, while UTF-EBCDIC is &quot;EBCDIC-safe&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Creating Unicode</h2> To create Unicode characters in literals for code points above 0xFF, use the &quot;\x{...}&quot; notation in double-quoted strings:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    my $smiley = &quot;\x{263a}&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Similarly, it can be used in regular expression literals<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $smiley =~ /\x{263a}/;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
At run-time you can use &quot;chr()&quot;:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    my $hebrew_alef = chr(0x05d0);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;Further Resources&quot; for how to find all these numeric codes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Naturally, &quot;ord()&quot; will do the reverse: it turns a character into a code point.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that &quot;\x..&quot; (no &quot;{}&quot; and only two hexadecimal digits), &quot;\x{...}&quot;, and &quot;chr(...)&quot; for arguments less than 0x100 (decimal 256) generate an eight-bit character for backward compatibility with older Perls.  For arguments of 0x100 or more, Unicode characters are always produced. If you want to force the production of Unicode characters regardless of the numeric value, use &quot;pack(&quot;U&quot;, ...)&quot; instead of &quot;\x..&quot;, &quot;\x{...}&quot;, or &quot;chr()&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can also use the &quot;charnames&quot; pragma to invoke characters by name in double-quoted strings:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use charnames ':full';<br/>
    my $arabic_alef = &quot;\N{ARABIC LETTER ALEF}&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And, as mentioned above, you can also &quot;pack()&quot; numbers into Unicode characters:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
   my $georgian_an  = pack(&quot;U&quot;, 0x10a0);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that both &quot;\x{...}&quot; and &quot;\N{...}&quot; are compile-time string constants: you cannot use variables in them.  if you want similar run-time functionality, use &quot;chr()&quot; and &quot;charnames::string_vianame()&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to force the result to Unicode characters, use the special &quot;U0&quot; prefix.  It consumes no arguments but causes the following bytes to be interpreted as the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode characters:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
   my $chars = pack(&quot;U0W*&quot;, 0x80, 0x42);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Likewise, you can stop such UTF-8 interpretation by using the special &quot;C0&quot; prefix.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Handling Unicode</h2> Handling Unicode is for the most part transparent: just use the strings as usual.  Functions like &quot;index()&quot;, &quot;length()&quot;, and &quot;substr()&quot; will work on the Unicode characters; regular expressions will work on the Unicode characters (see perlunicode and perlretut).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that Perl considers grapheme clusters to be separate characters, so for example<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use charnames ':full';<br/>
    print length(&quot;\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A}\N{COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}&quot;), &quot;\n&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
will print 2, not 1.  The only exception is that regular expressions have &quot;\X&quot; for matching an extended grapheme cluster.  (Thus &quot;\X&quot; in a regular expression would match the entire sequence of both the example characters.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Life is not quite so transparent, however, when working with legacy encodings, I/O, and certain special cases:</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Legacy Encodings</h2> When you combine legacy data and Unicode, the legacy data needs to be upgraded to Unicode.  Normally the legacy data is assumed to be ISO 8859-1 (or EBCDIC, if applicable).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;Encode&quot; module knows about many encodings and has interfaces for doing conversions between those encodings:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use Encode 'decode';<br/>
    $data = decode(&quot;iso-8859-3&quot;, $data); # convert from legacy to utf-8<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode I/O</h2> Normally, writing out Unicode data<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    print FH $some_string_with_unicode, &quot;\n&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
produces raw bytes that Perl happens to use to internally encode the Unicode string.  Perl's internal encoding depends on the system as well as what characters happen to be in the string at the time. If any of the characters are at code points 0x100 or above, you will get a warning.  To ensure that the output is explicitly rendered in the encoding you desire--and to avoid the warning--open the stream with the desired encoding. Some examples:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    open FH, &quot;&gt;:utf8&quot;, &quot;file&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
    open FH, &quot;&gt;:encoding(ucs2)&quot;,      &quot;file&quot;;<br/>
    open FH, &quot;&gt;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;,     &quot;file&quot;;<br/>
    open FH, &quot;&gt;:encoding(shift_jis)&quot;, &quot;file&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
and on already open streams, use &quot;binmode()&quot;:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    binmode(STDOUT, &quot;:utf8&quot;);<br/>
<br/>
    binmode(STDOUT, &quot;:encoding(ucs2)&quot;);<br/>
    binmode(STDOUT, &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;);<br/>
    binmode(STDOUT, &quot;:encoding(shift_jis)&quot;);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The matching of encoding names is loose: case does not matter, and many encodings have several aliases.  Note that the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer must always be specified exactly like that; it is  <i>not</i> subject to the loose matching of encoding names. Also note that currently &quot;:utf8&quot; is unsafe for input, because it accepts the data without validating that it is indeed valid UTF-8; you should instead use &quot;:encoding(utf-8)&quot; (with or without a hyphen).<div class="spacer">
</div>
See PerlIO for the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer, PerlIO::encoding and Encode::PerlIO for the &quot;:encoding()&quot; layer, and Encode::Supported for many encodings supported by the &quot;Encode&quot; module.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Reading in a file that you know happens to be encoded in one of the Unicode or legacy encodings does not magically turn the data into Unicode in Perl's eyes.  To do that, specify the appropriate layer when opening files<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    open(my $fh,'&lt;:encoding(utf8)', 'anything');<br/>
    my $line_of_unicode = &lt;$fh&gt;;<br/>
<br/>
    open(my $fh,'&lt;:encoding(Big5)', 'anything');<br/>
    my $line_of_unicode = &lt;$fh&gt;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The I/O layers can also be specified more flexibly with the &quot;open&quot; pragma.  See open, or look at the following example.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use open ':encoding(utf8)'; # input/output default encoding will be<br/>
                                # UTF-8<br/>
    open X, &quot;&gt;file&quot;;<br/>
    print X chr(0x100), &quot;\n&quot;;<br/>
    close X;<br/>
    open Y, &quot;&lt;file&quot;;<br/>
    printf &quot;%#x\n&quot;, ord(&lt;Y&gt;); # this should print 0x100<br/>
    close Y;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
With the &quot;open&quot; pragma you can use the &quot;:locale&quot; layer<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    BEGIN { $ENV{LC_ALL} = $ENV{LANG} = 'ru_RU.KOI8-R' }<br/>
    # the :locale will probe the locale environment variables like<br/>
    # LC_ALL<br/>
    use open OUT =&gt; ':locale'; # russki parusski<br/>
    open(O, &quot;&gt;koi8&quot;);<br/>
    print O chr(0x430); # Unicode CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A = KOI8-R 0xc1<br/>
    close O;<br/>
    open(I, &quot;&lt;koi8&quot;);<br/>
    printf &quot;%#x\n&quot;, ord(&lt;I&gt;), &quot;\n&quot;; # this should print 0xc1<br/>
    close I;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
These methods install a transparent filter on the I/O stream that converts data from the specified encoding when it is read in from the stream.  The result is always Unicode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The open pragma affects all the &quot;open()&quot; calls after the pragma by setting default layers.  If you want to affect only certain streams, use explicit layers directly in the &quot;open()&quot; call.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can switch encodings on an already opened stream by using &quot;binmode()&quot;; see &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;:locale&quot; does not currently (as of Perl 5.8.0) work with &quot;open()&quot; and &quot;binmode()&quot;, only with the &quot;open&quot; pragma.  The &quot;:utf8&quot; and &quot;:encoding(...)&quot; methods do work with all of &quot;open()&quot;, &quot;binmode()&quot;, and the &quot;open&quot; pragma.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Similarly, you may use these I/O layers on output streams to automatically convert Unicode to the specified encoding when it is written to the stream. For example, the following snippet copies the contents of the file &quot;text.jis&quot; (encoded as ISO-2022-JP, aka JIS) to the file &quot;text.utf8&quot;, encoded as UTF-8:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    open(my $nihongo, '&lt;:encoding(iso-2022-jp)', 'text.jis');<br/>
    open(my $unicode, '&gt;:utf8',                  'text.utf8');<br/>
    while (&lt;$nihongo&gt;) { print $unicode $_ }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The naming of encodings, both by the &quot;open()&quot; and by the &quot;open&quot; pragma allows for flexible names: &quot;koi8-r&quot; and &quot;KOI8R&quot; will both be understood.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Common encodings recognized by ISO, MIME, IANA, and various other standardisation organisations are recognised; for a more detailed list see Encode::Supported.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;read()&quot; reads characters and returns the number of characters. &quot;seek()&quot; and &quot;tell()&quot; operate on byte counts, as do &quot;sysread()&quot; and &quot;sysseek()&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Notice that because of the default behaviour of not doing any conversion upon input if there is no default layer, it is easy to mistakenly write code that keeps on expanding a file by repeatedly encoding the data:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    # BAD CODE WARNING<br/>
    open F, &quot;file&quot;;<br/>
    local $/; ## read in the whole file of 8-bit characters<br/>
    $t = &lt;F&gt;;<br/>
    close F;<br/>
    open F, &quot;&gt;:encoding(utf8)&quot;, &quot;file&quot;;<br/>
    print F $t; ## convert to UTF-8 on output<br/>
    close F;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you run this code twice, the contents of the <i>file</i> will be twice UTF-8 encoded.  A &quot;use open ':encoding(utf8)'&quot; would have avoided the bug, or explicitly opening also the  <i>file</i> for input as UTF-8.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>NOTE</b>: the &quot;:utf8&quot; and &quot;:encoding&quot; features work only if your Perl has been built with the new PerlIO feature (which is the default on most systems).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Displaying Unicode As Text</h2> Sometimes you might want to display Perl scalars containing Unicode as simple ASCII (or EBCDIC) text.  The following subroutine converts its argument so that Unicode characters with code points greater than 255 are displayed as &quot;\x{...}&quot;, control characters (like &quot;\n&quot;) are displayed as &quot;\x..&quot;, and the rest of the characters as themselves:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 sub nice_string {<br/>
     join(&quot;&quot;,<br/>
       map { $_ &gt; 255 ?                  # if wide character...<br/>
              sprintf(&quot;\\x{%04X}&quot;, $_) :  # \x{...}<br/>
              chr($_) =~ /[[:cntrl:]]/ ?  # else if control character ...<br/>
              sprintf(&quot;\\x%02X&quot;, $_) :    # \x..<br/>
              quotemeta(chr($_))          # else quoted or as themselves<br/>
         } unpack(&quot;W*&quot;, $_[0]));           # unpack Unicode characters<br/>
   }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
   nice_string(&quot;foo\x{100}bar\n&quot;)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
returns the string<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
   'foo\x{0100}bar\x0A'<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
which is ready to be printed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Special Cases</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Bit Complement Operator ~ And <i>vec()</i><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The bit complement operator &quot;~&quot; may produce surprising results if used on strings containing characters with ordinal values above 255. In such a case, the results are consistent with the internal encoding of the characters, but not with much else. So don't do that. Similarly for &quot;vec()&quot;: you will be operating on the internally-encoded bit patterns of the Unicode characters, not on the code point values, which is very probably not what you want.</dd>

Peeking At Perl's Internal Encoding<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Normal users of Perl should never care how Perl encodes any particular Unicode string (because the normal ways to get at the contents of a string with Unicode--via input and output--should always be via explicitly-defined I/O layers). But if you must, there are two ways of looking behind the scenes.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
One way of peeking inside the internal encoding of Unicode characters is to use &quot;unpack(&quot;C*&quot;, ...&quot; to get the bytes of whatever the string encoding happens to be, or &quot;unpack(&quot;U0..&quot;, ...)&quot; to get the bytes of the UTF-8 encoding:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    # this prints  c4 80  for the UTF-8 bytes 0xc4 0x80<br/>
    print join(&quot; &quot;, unpack(&quot;U0(H2)*&quot;, pack(&quot;U&quot;, 0x100))), &quot;\n&quot;;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Yet another way would be to use the Devel::Peek module:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    perl -MDevel::Peek -e 'Dump(chr(0x100))'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
That shows the &quot;UTF8&quot; flag in FLAGS and both the UTF-8 bytes and Unicode characters in &quot;PV&quot;.  See also later in this document the discussion about the &quot;utf8::is_utf8()&quot; function.</dd>

String Equivalence<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The question of string equivalence turns somewhat complicated in Unicode: what do you mean by &quot;equal&quot;?<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(Is &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE&quot; equal to &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A&quot;?)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The short answer is that by default Perl compares equivalence (&quot;eq&quot;, &quot;ne&quot;) based only on code points of the characters.  In the above case, the answer is no (because 0x00C1 != 0x0041).  But sometimes, any CAPITAL LETTER A's should be considered equal, or even A's of any case.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The long answer is that you need to consider character normalization and casing issues: see Unicode::Normalize, Unicode Technical Report #15, Unicode Normalization Forms &lt;http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15&gt; and sections on case mapping in the Unicode Standard &lt;http://www.unicode.org&gt;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As of Perl 5.8.0, the &quot;Full&quot; case-folding of <i>Case</i>  <i>Mappings/SpecialCasing</i> is implemented, but bugs remain in &quot;qr//i&quot; with them, mostly fixed by 5.14.</dd>

String Collation<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
People like to see their strings nicely sorted--or as Unicode parlance goes, collated.  But again, what do you mean by collate?<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(Does &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE&quot; come before or after &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE&quot;?)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The short answer is that by default, Perl compares strings (&quot;lt&quot;, &quot;le&quot;, &quot;cmp&quot;, &quot;ge&quot;, &quot;gt&quot;) based only on the code points of the characters.  In the above case, the answer is &quot;after&quot;, since 0x00C1 &gt; 0x00C0.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The long answer is that &quot;it depends&quot;, and a good answer cannot be given without knowing (at the very least) the language context. See Unicode::Collate, and  <i>Unicode Collation Algorithm</i> &lt;http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/&gt;</dd>

Character Ranges and Classes<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Character ranges in regular expression bracketed character classes ( e.g., &quot;/[a-z]/&quot;) and in the &quot;tr///&quot; (also known as &quot;y///&quot;) operator are not magically Unicode-aware.  What this means is that &quot;[A-Za-z]&quot; will not magically start to mean &quot;all alphabetic letters&quot; (not that it does mean that even for 8-bit characters; for those, if you are using locales (perllocale), use &quot;/[[:alpha:]]/&quot;; and if not, use the 8-bit-aware property &quot;\p{alpha}&quot;).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
All the properties that begin with &quot;\p&quot; (and its inverse &quot;\P&quot;) are actually character classes that are Unicode-aware.  There are dozens of them, see perluniprops.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can use Unicode code points as the end points of character ranges, and the range will include all Unicode code points that lie between those end points.</dd>

String-To-Number Conversions<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Unicode does define several other decimal--and numeric--characters besides the familiar 0 to 9, such as the Arabic and Indic digits. Perl does not support string-to-number conversion for digits other than ASCII 0 to 9 (and ASCII a to f for hexadecimal). To get safe conversions from any Unicode string, use &quot; <i>num()</i>&quot; in Unicode::UCD.</dd>

Will My Old Scripts Break?<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Very probably not.  Unless you are generating Unicode characters somehow, old behaviour should be preserved.  About the only behaviour that has changed and which could start generating Unicode is the old behaviour of &quot;chr()&quot; where supplying an argument more than 255 produced a character modulo 255.  &quot;chr(300)&quot;, for example, was equal to &quot;chr(45)&quot; or &quot;-&quot; (in ASCII), now it is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH BREVE.</dd>

How Do I Make My Scripts Work With Unicode?<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Very little work should be needed since nothing changes until you generate Unicode data.  The most important thing is getting input as Unicode; for that, see the earlier I/O discussion. To get full seamless Unicode support, add &quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot; (or &quot;use 5.012&quot; or higher) to your script.</dd>

How Do I Know Whether My String Is In Unicode?<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You shouldn't have to care.  But you may if your Perl is before 5.14.0 or you haven't specified &quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot; or &quot;use 5.012&quot; (or higher) because otherwise the semantics of the code points in the range 128 to 255 are different depending on whether the string they are contained within is in Unicode or not. (See &quot;When Unicode Does Not Happen&quot; in perlunicode.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To determine if a string is in Unicode, use:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    print utf8::is_utf8($string) ? 1 : 0, &quot;\n&quot;;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
But note that this doesn't mean that any of the characters in the string are necessary UTF-8 encoded, or that any of the characters have code points greater than 0xFF (255) or even 0x80 (128), or that the string has any characters at all.  All the &quot;is_utf8()&quot; does is to return the value of the internal &quot;utf8ness&quot; flag attached to the $string.  If the flag is off, the bytes in the scalar are interpreted as a single byte encoding.  If the flag is on, the bytes in the scalar are interpreted as the (variable-length, potentially multi-byte) UTF-8 encoded code points of the characters.  Bytes added to a UTF-8 encoded string are automatically upgraded to UTF-8.  If mixed non-UTF-8 and UTF-8 scalars are merged (double-quoted interpolation, explicit concatenation, or printf/sprintf parameter substitution), the result will be UTF-8 encoded as if copies of the byte strings were upgraded to UTF-8: for example,<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $a = &quot;ab\x80c&quot;;<br/>
    $b = &quot;\x{100}&quot;;<br/>
    print &quot;$a = $b\n&quot;;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
the output string will be UTF-8-encoded &quot;ab\x80c = \x{100}\n&quot;, but $a will stay byte-encoded.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Sometimes you might really need to know the byte length of a string instead of the character length. For that use either the &quot;Encode::encode_utf8()&quot; function or the &quot;bytes&quot; pragma and the &quot;length()&quot; function:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $unicode = chr(0x100);<br/>
    print length($unicode), &quot;\n&quot;; # will print 1<br/>
    require Encode;<br/>
    print length(Encode::encode_utf8($unicode)), &quot;\n&quot;; # will print 2<br/>
    use bytes;<br/>
    print length($unicode), &quot;\n&quot;; # will also print 2<br/>
                                  # (the 0xC4 0x80 of the UTF-8)<br/>
    no bytes;<br/>

How Do I Detect Data That's Not Valid In a Particular Encoding?<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use the &quot;Encode&quot; package to try converting it. For example,<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use Encode 'decode_utf8';<br/>
<br/>
    if (eval { decode_utf8($string, Encode::FB_CROAK); 1 }) {<br/>
        # $string is valid utf8<br/>
    } else {<br/>
        # $string is not valid utf8<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Or use &quot;unpack&quot; to try decoding it:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use warnings;<br/>
    @chars = unpack(&quot;C0U*&quot;, $string_of_bytes_that_I_think_is_utf8);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If invalid, a &quot;Malformed UTF-8 character&quot; warning is produced. The &quot;C0&quot; means &quot;process the string character per character&quot;.  Without that, the &quot;unpack(&quot;U*&quot;, ...)&quot; would work in &quot;U0&quot; mode (the default if the format string starts with &quot;U&quot;) and it would return the bytes making up the UTF-8 encoding of the target string, something that will always work.</dd>

How Do I Convert Binary Data Into a Particular Encoding, Or Vice Versa?<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This probably isn't as useful as you might think. Normally, you shouldn't need to.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In one sense, what you are asking doesn't make much sense: encodings are for characters, and binary data are not &quot;characters&quot;, so converting &quot;data&quot; into some encoding isn't meaningful unless you know in what character set and encoding the binary data is in, in which case it's not just binary data, now is it?<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you have a raw sequence of bytes that you know should be interpreted via a particular encoding, you can use &quot;Encode&quot;:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use Encode 'from_to';<br/>
    from_to($data, &quot;iso-8859-1&quot;, &quot;utf-8&quot;); # from latin-1 to utf-8<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The call to &quot;from_to()&quot; changes the bytes in $data, but nothing material about the nature of the string has changed as far as Perl is concerned.  Both before and after the call, the string $data contains just a bunch of 8-bit bytes. As far as Perl is concerned, the encoding of the string remains as &quot;system-native 8-bit bytes&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You might relate this to a fictional 'Translate' module:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   use Translate;<br/>
   my $phrase = &quot;Yes&quot;;<br/>
   Translate::from_to($phrase, 'english', 'deutsch');<br/>
   ## phrase now contains &quot;Ja&quot;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The contents of the string changes, but not the nature of the string. Perl doesn't know any more after the call than before that the contents of the string indicates the affirmative.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Back to converting data.  If you have (or want) data in your system's native 8-bit encoding (e.g. Latin-1, EBCDIC, etc.), you can use pack/unpack to convert to/from Unicode.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $native_string  = pack(&quot;W*&quot;, unpack(&quot;U*&quot;, $Unicode_string));<br/>
    $Unicode_string = pack(&quot;U*&quot;, unpack(&quot;W*&quot;, $native_string));<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you have a sequence of bytes you <b>know</b> is valid UTF-8, but Perl doesn't know it yet, you can make Perl a believer, too:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use Encode 'decode_utf8';<br/>
    $Unicode = decode_utf8($bytes);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
or:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $Unicode = pack(&quot;U0a*&quot;, $bytes);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can find the bytes that make up a UTF-8 sequence with<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    @bytes = unpack(&quot;C*&quot;, $Unicode_string)<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
and you can create well-formed Unicode with<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    $Unicode_string = pack(&quot;U*&quot;, 0xff, ...)<br/>

How Does Unicode Work With Traditional Locales?<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl tries to keep the two separated.  Code points that are above 255 are treated as Unicode; those below 256, generally as locale.  This works reasonably well except in some case-insensitive regular expression pattern matches that in Unicode would cross the 255/256 boundary.  These are disallowed. Also, the &quot;\p{}&quot; and &quot;\N{}&quot; constructs silently assume Unicode values even for code points below 256. See also perlrun for the description of the &quot;-C&quot; switch and its environment counterpart, $ENV{PERL_UNICODE} to see how to enable various Unicode features, for example by using locale settings.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Hexadecimal Notation</h2> The Unicode standard prefers using hexadecimal notation because that more clearly shows the division of Unicode into blocks of 256 characters. Hexadecimal is also simply shorter than decimal.  You can use decimal notation, too, but learning to use hexadecimal just makes life easier with the Unicode standard.  The &quot;U+HHHH&quot; notation uses hexadecimal, for example.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;0x&quot; prefix means a hexadecimal number, the digits are 0-9 <i>and</i> a-f (or A-F, case doesn't matter).  Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits, or half a byte.  &quot;print 0x..., &quot;\n&quot;&quot; will show a hexadecimal number in decimal, and &quot;printf &quot;%x\n&quot;, $decimal&quot; will show a decimal number in hexadecimal.  If you have just the &quot;hex digits&quot; of a hexadecimal number, you can use the &quot;hex()&quot; function.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    print 0x0009, &quot;\n&quot;;    # 9<br/>
    print 0x000a, &quot;\n&quot;;    # 10<br/>
    print 0x000f, &quot;\n&quot;;    # 15<br/>

<br/>
    printf &quot;%x\n&quot;,  65;    # 41<br/>
    printf &quot;%#x\n&quot;, 65;    # 0x41<br/>
