<h1>NAME</h1> perl51311delta - what is new for perl v5.13.11</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.13.10 release and the 5.13.11 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.13.9, first read perl5139delta, which describes differences between 5.13.9 and 5.13.10.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Security</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>User-defined regular expression properties</h2> Perl no longer allows a tainted regular expression to invoke a user-defined property via &quot;\p{...}&quot; syntax. It simply dies instead [perl #82616].</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>local($_) will strip all magic from $_</h2>  <i>local()</i> on scalar variables will give them a new value, but keep all their magic intact.  This has proven to be problematic for the default scalar variable $_, where perlsub recommends that any subroutine that assigns to $_ should localize it first.  This would throw an exception if $_ is aliased to a read-only variable, and could have various unintentional side-effects in general.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Therefore, as an exception to the general rule, local($_) will not only assign a new value to $_, but also remove all existing magic from it as well.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Passing references to <i>warn()</i></h2> An earlier Perl 5.13.x release changed &quot;warn($ref)&quot; to leave the reference unchanged, allowing $SIG{__WARN__} handlers to access the original reference. But this stopped warnings that were references from having the file and line number appended even when there was no $SIG{__WARN__} handler in place.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now &quot;warn&quot; checks for the presence of such a handler and, if there is none, proceeds to stringify the reference and append the file and line number. This allows simple uses of &quot;warn&quot; for debugging to continue to work as they did before.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>fork()</i> emulation will not wait for signalled children</h2> On Windows parent processes would not terminate until all forked childred had terminated first.  However, &quot;kill('KILL', ...)&quot; is inherently unstable on pseudo-processes, and &quot;kill('TERM', ...)&quot; might not get delivered if the child if blocked in a system call.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To avoid the deadlock and still provide a safe mechanism to terminate the hosting process, Perl will now no longer wait for children that have been sent a SIGTERM signal.  It is up to the parent process to  <i>waitpid()</i> for these children if child clean-up processing must be allowed to finish. However, it is also the responsibility of the parent then to avoid the deadlock by making sure the child process can't be blocked on I/O either.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See perlfork for more information about the <i>fork()</i> emulation on Windows.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Perl source code is read in text mode on Windows</h2> Perl scripts used to be read in binary mode on Windows for the benefit of the ByteLoader module (which is no longer part of core Perl).  This had the side effect of breaking various operations on the DATA filehandle, including  <i>seek()</i>/<i>tell()</i>, and even simply reading from DATA after file handles have been flushed by a call to  <i>system()</i>, backticks, <i>fork()</i> etc.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The default build options for Windows have been changed to read Perl source code on Windows in text mode now.  Hopefully ByteLoader will be updated on CPAN to automatically handle this situation.</div>
</div>

<h1>Performance Enhancements</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
An earlier optimisation to speed up &quot;my @array = ...&quot; and &quot;my %hash = ...&quot; assignments caused a bug and was disabled in Perl 5.12.0.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Now we have found another way to speed up these assignments [perl #82110].</dd>

<h1>Selected Bug Fixes</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A fix for a bug in &quot;length(undef)&quot; in 5.13.4 introduced a regression that meant &quot;print length undef&quot; did not warn when warnings were enabled. It now correctly warns [perl #85508].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;(?|...)&quot; regular expression construct no longer crashes if the final branch has more sets of capturing parentheses than any other branch. This was fixed in Perl 5.10.1 for the case of a single branch, but that fix did not take multiple branches into account [perl #84746].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Accessing an element of a package array with a hard-coded number (as opposed to an arbitrary expression) would crash if the array did not exist. Usually the array would be autovivified during compilation, but typeglob manipulation could remove it, as in these two cases which used to crash:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  *d = *a;  print $d[0];<br/>
  undef *d; print $d[0];<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;#line&quot; directives in string evals were not properly updating the arrays of lines of code (&quot;@{&quot;_&lt;...&quot;}&quot;) that the debugger (or any debugging or profiling module) uses. In threaded builds, they were not being updated at all. In non-threaded builds, the line number was ignored, so any change to the existing line number would cause the lines to be misnumbered [perl #79442].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
$AUTOLOAD used to remain tainted forever if it ever became tainted. Now it is correctly untainted if an autoloaded method is called and the method name was not tainted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A bug has been fixed in the implementation of &quot;{...}&quot; quantifiers in regular expressions that prevented the code block in &quot;/((\w+)(?{ print $2 })){2}/&quot; from seeing the $2 sometimes [perl #84294].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;sprintf&quot; now dies when passed a tainted scalar for the format. It did already die for arbitrary expressions, but not for simple scalars [perl #82250].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
DESTROY methods of objects implementing ties are no longer able to crash by accessing the tied variable through a weak reference [perl #86328].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
On Windows, calling kill(9, $child) on a pseudo-process created by the <i>fork()</i> emulation is inherently unstable.  It can also be responsible for overriding the parent process exit code with a value of '9' if the parent terminates right after killing the child.  This condition will now happen a lot less often than before.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See also &quot;<i>fork()</i> emulation will not wait for signalled children&quot; for a better way to terminate child processes that avoids deadlocks altogether.</dd>

<dd>
Ensure that the &quot;exists &amp;Errno::EFOO&quot; idiom continues to work as documented.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A change post-5.12 caused the documented idiom not to work if Errno was loaded after the &quot;exists&quot; code had been compiled, as the compiler implicitly creates typeglobs in the Errno symbol table when it builds the optree for the &quot;exists code&quot;.</dd>

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
