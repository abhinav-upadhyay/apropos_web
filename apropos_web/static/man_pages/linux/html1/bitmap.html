<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>bitmap</i> program is a rudimentary tool for creating or editing rectangular images made up of 1's and 0's.  Bitmaps are used in X for defining clipping regions, cursor shapes, icon shapes, and tile and stipple patterns.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>bmtoa</i> and <i>atobm</i> filters convert <i>bitmap</i> files (FILE FORMAT) to and from ASCII strings.  They are most commonly used to quickly print out bitmaps and to generate versions for including in text.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</h1>  <i>Bitmap</i> supports the standard X Toolkit command line arguments (see  <i>X</i>(1)).  The following additional arguments are supported as well.<dl>

<div class="section">
<h1>USAGE</h1>  <i>Bitmap</i> displays grid in which each square represents a single bit in the picture being edited.  Actual size of the bitmap image, as it would appear normally and inverted, can be obtained by pressing <b></b>  <b>Meta-I</b> key.  You are free to move the image popup out of the way to continue editing.  Pressing the left mouse button in the popup window or <b> Meta-I</b> again will remove the real size bitmap image.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bitmap is to be used for defining a cursor, one of the squares in the images may be designated as the hot spot.  This determines where the cursor is actually pointing.  For cursors with sharp tips (such as arrows or fingers), this is usually at the end of the tip; for symmetric cursors (such as crosses or bullseyes), this is usually at the center.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Bitmaps are stored as small C code fragments suitable for including in applications.  They provide an array of bits as well as symbolic constants giving the width, height, and hot spot (if specified) that may be used in creating cursors, icons, and tiles.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EDITING</h1> To edit a bitmap image simply click on one of the buttons with drawing commands ( <b>Point, Curve, Line, Rectangle,</b> etc.) and move the pointer into the bitmap grid  window.  Press one of the buttons on your mouse and the appropriate action will take place.  You can either set, clear or invert the gird squares.  Setting a grid square corresponds to setting a bit in the bitmap image to 1.  Clearing a grid square corresponds to setting a bit in the bitmap image to 0.  Inverting a grid square corresponds to changing a bit in the bitmap image from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0, depending what its previous state was. The default behavior of mouse buttons is as specified below.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
		MouseButton1		Set<br/>
		MouseButton2		Invert<br/>
		MouseButton3		Clear<br/>
		MouseButton4		Clear<br/>
		MouseButton5		Clear<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This default behavior can be changed by setting the button function resources.  An example is provided below.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
		bitmap*button1Function: Set<br/>
		bitmap*button2Function: Clear<br/>
		bitmap*button3Function: Invert<br/>
		etc.<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The button function applies to all drawing commands, including copying, moving and pasting, flood filling and setting the hot spot.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DRAWING COMMANDS</h1> Here is the list of drawing commands accessible through the buttons at the left side of the application's window.  Some commands can be aborted by pressing A inside the bitmap window, allowing the user to select different guiding points where applicable.<dl>
<dt>
<b>Clear</b></dt>
<dd>
This command clears all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares will be set to the background color.  Pressing C inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Set</b></dt>
<dd>
This command sets all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares will be set to the foreground color.  Pressing S inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Invert</b></dt>
<dd>
This command inverts all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares will be inverted appropriately.  Pressing I inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Mark</b></dt>
<dd>
This command is used to mark an area of the grid by dragging out a rectangular shape in the highlighting color.  Once the area is marked, it can be operated on by a number of commands (see  <b>Up, Down, Left,</b>  <b>Right, Rotate, Flip, Cut,</b> etc.)  Only one marked area can be present at any time.  If you attempt to mark another area, the old mark will vanish.  The same effect can be achieved by pressing <b></b>  <b>Shift-MouseButton1</b> and dragging out a rectangle in the grid window. Pressing <b> Shift-MouseButton2</b> will mark the entire grid area.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Unmark</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will cause the marked area to vanish.  The same effect can be achieved by pressing <b> Shift-MouseButton3</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Copy</b></dt>
<dd>
This command is used to copy an area of the grid from one location to another.  If there is no marked grid area displayed, <b> Copy</b> behaves just like <b> Mark</b> described above.  Once there is a marked grid area displayed in the highlighting color, this command has two alternative behaviors.  If you click a mouse button inside the marked area, you will be able to drag the rectangle that represents the marked area to the desired location.  After you release the mouse button, the area will be copied.  If you click outside the marked area, <b> Copy</b> will assume that you wish to mark a different region of the bitmap image, thus it will behave like <b> Mark</b> again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Move</b></dt>
<dd>
This command is used to move an area of the grid from one location to another.  Its behavior resembles the behavior of <b> Copy</b> command, except that the marked area will be moved instead of copied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Flip Horizontally</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the horizontal axes. If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing H inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Up</b></dt>
<dd>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel up. If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing UpArrow inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Flip Vertically</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the vertical axes. If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing V inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Left</b></dt>
<dd>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel to the left. If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing LeftArrow inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Fold</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will fold the bitmap image so that the opposite corners become adjacent.  This is useful when creating bitmap images for tiling.  Pressing F inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Right</b></dt>
<dd>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel to the right. If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing RightArrow inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Rotate Left</b></dt>
<dd>
This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the left (counter clockwise.) If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing L inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Down</b></dt>
<dd>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel down. If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing DownArrow inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Rotate Right</b></dt>
<dd>
This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the right (clockwise.) If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing R inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Point</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will change the grid squares underneath the mouse pointer if a mouse button is being pressed down.  If you drag the mouse button continuously, the line may not be continuous, depending on the speed of your system and frequency of mouse motion events.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Curve</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will change the grid squares underneath the mouse pointer if a mouse button is being pressed down.  If you drag the mouse button continuously, it will make sure that the line is continuous.  If your system is slow or <i> bitmap</i> receives very few mouse motion events, it might behave quite strangely.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Line</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will change the gird squares in a line between two squares. Once you press a mouse button in the grid window, <i> bitmap</i> will highlight the line from the square where the mouse button was initially pressed to the square where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing the mouse button you will cause the change to take effect, and the highlighted line will disappear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Rectangle</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will change the gird squares in a rectangle between two squares. Once you press a mouse button in the grid window, <i> bitmap</i> will highlight the rectangle from the square where the mouse button was initially pressed to the square where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing the mouse button you will cause the change to take effect, and the highlighted rectangle will disappear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Filled Rectangle</b></dt>
<dd>
This command is identical to<b> Rectangle</b>, except at the end the rectangle will be filled rather than outlined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Circle</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will change the gird squares in a circle between two squares. Once you press a mouse button in the grid window, <i> bitmap</i> will highlight the circle from the square where the mouse button was initially pressed to the square where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing the mouse button you will cause the change to take effect, and the highlighted circle will disappear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Filled Circle</b></dt>
<dd>
This command is identical to<b> Circle</b>, except at the end the circle will be filled rather than outlined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Flood Fill</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will flood fill the connected area underneath the mouse pointer when you click on the desired square.  Diagonally adjacent squares are not considered to be connected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Set Hot Spot</b></dt>
<dd>
This command designates one square in the grid as the hot spot if this bitmap image is to be used for defining a cursor.  Pressing a mouse button in the desired square will cause a diamond shape to be displayed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Clear Hot Spot</b></dt>
<dd>
This command removes any designated hot spot from the bitmap image.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Undo</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will undo the last executed command.  It has depth one, that is, pressing <b> Undo</b> after<b> Undo</b> will undo itself.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FILE MENU</h1> The File menu commands can be accessed by pressing the File button and selecting the appropriate menu entry, or by pressing Ctrl key with another key.  These commands deal with files and global bitmap parameters, such as size, basename, filename etc.<dl>
<dt>
<b>New</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will clear the editing area and prompt for the name of the new file to be edited.  It will not load in the new file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Load</b></dt>
<dd>
This command is used to load a new bitmap file into the bitmap editor. If the current image has not been saved, user will be asked whether to save or ignore the changes.  The editor can edit only one file at a time.  If you need interactive editing, run a number of editors and use cut and paste mechanism as described below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Insert</b></dt>
<dd>
This command is used to insert a bitmap file into the image being currently edited.  After being prompted for the filename, click inside the grid window and drag the outlined rectangle to the location where you want to insert the new file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Save</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will save the bitmap image.  It will not prompt for the filename unless it is said to be &lt;none&gt;.  If you leave the filename undesignated or -, the output will be piped to stdout.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Save As</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will save the bitmap image after prompting for a new filename.  It should be used if you want to change the filename.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Resize</b></dt>
<dd>
This command is used to resize the editing area to the new number of pixels.  The size should be entered in the WIDTHxHEIGHT format.  The information in the image being edited will not be lost unless the new size is smaller that the current image size. The editor was not designed to edit huge files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Rescale</b></dt>
<dd>
This command is used to rescale the editing area to the new width and height.  The size should be entered in the WIDTHxHEIGHT format.  It will not do antialiasing and information will be lost if you rescale to the smaller sizes.  Feel free to add you own algorithms for better rescaling.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Filename</b></dt>
<dd>
This command is used to change the filename without changing the basename nor saving the file.  If you specify - for a filename, the output will be piped to stdout.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Basename</b></dt>
<dd>
This command is used to change the basename, if a different one from the specified filename is desired.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Quit</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will terminate the bitmap application.  If the file was not saved, user will be prompted and asked whether to save the image or not.  This command is preferred over killing the process.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EDIT MENU</h1> The Edit menu commands can be accessed by pressing the Edit button and selecting the appropriate menu entry, or by pressing Meta key with another key.  These commands deal with editing facilities such as grid, axes, zooming, cut and paste, etc.<dl>
<dt>
<b>Image</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will display the image being edited and its inverse in its actual size in a separate window.  The window can be moved away to continue with editing.  Pressing the left mouse button in the image window will cause it to disappear from the screen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Grid</b></dt>
<dd>
This command controls the grid in the editing area.  If the grid spacing is below the value specified by gridTolerance resource (8 by default), the grid will be automatically turned off.  It can be enforced by explicitly activating this command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Dashed</b></dt>
<dd>
This command controls the stipple for drawing the grid lines.  The stipple specified by dashes resource can be turned on or off by activating this command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Axes</b></dt>
<dd>
This command controls the highlighting of the main axes of the image being edited.  The actual lines are not part of the image.  They are provided to aid user when constructing symmetrical images, or whenever having the main axes highlighted helps your editing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Stippled</b></dt>
<dd>
This command controls the stippling of the highlighted areas of the bitmap image.  The stipple specified by stipple resource can be turned on or off by activating this command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Proportional</b></dt>
<dd>
This command controls the proportional mode.  If the proportional mode is on, width and height of all image squares are forced to be equal, regardless of the proportions of the bitmap window.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Zoom</b></dt>
<dd>
This command controls the zoom mode.  If there is a marked area of the image already displayed, bitmap will automatically zoom into it.  Otherwise, user will have to highlight an area to be edited in the zoom mode and bitmap will automatically switch into it.  One can use all the editing commands and other utilities in the zoom mode.  When you zoom out, undo command will undo the whole zoom session.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Cut</b></dt>
<dd>
This commands cuts the contents of the highlighted image area into the internal cut and paste buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Copy</b></dt>
<dd>
This command copies the contents of the highlighted image area into the internal cut and paste buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Paste</b></dt>
<dd>
This command will check if there are any other bitmap applications with a highlighted image area, or if there is something in the internal cut and paste buffer and copy it to the image.  To place the copied image, click in the editing window and drag the outlined image to the position where you want to place i, and then release the button.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CUT AND PASTE</h1> Bitmap supports two cut and paste mechanisms; the internal cut and paste and the global X selection cut and paste.  The internal cut and paste is used when executing copy and move drawing commands and also cut and copy commands from the edit menu.  The global X selection cut and paste is used whenever there is a highlighted area of a bitmap image displayed anywhere on the screen.  To copy a part of image from another bitmap editor simply highlight the desired area by using the Mark command or pressing the shift key and dragging the area with the left mouse button.  When the selected area becomes highlighted, any other applications (such as xterm, etc.) that use primary selection will discard their selection values and unhighlight the appropriate information.  Now, use the Paste command for the Edit menu or control mouse button to copy the selected part of image into another (or the same) bitmap application.  If you attempt to do this without a visible highlighted image area, the bitmap will fall back to the internal cut and paste buffer and paste whatever was there stored at the moment.</div>
