<h1>NAME</h1> perl5110delta - what is new for perl v5.11.0</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.10.0 release and the 5.11.0 development release.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode interpretation of \w, \d, \s, and the POSIX character classes redefined.</h2> Previous versions of Perl tried to map POSIX style character class definitions onto Unicode property names so that patterns would &quot;dwim&quot; when matches were made against latin-1 or unicode strings. This proved to be a mistake, breaking character class negation, causing forward compatibility problems (as Unicode keeps updating their property definitions and adding new characters), and other problems.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Therefore we have now defined a new set of artificial &quot;unicode&quot; property names which will be used to do unicode matching of patterns using POSIX style character classes and perl short-form escape character classes like \w and \d.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The key change here is that \d will no longer match every digit in the unicode standard (there are thousands) nor will \w match every word character in the standard, instead they will match precisely their POSIX or Perl definition.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Those needing to match based on Unicode properties can continue to do so by using the \p{} syntax to match whichever property they like, including the new artificial definitions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>NOTE:</b> This is a backwards incompatible no-warning change in behaviour. If you are upgrading and you process large volumes of text look for POSIX and Perl style character classes and change them to the relevant property name (by removing the word 'Posix' from the current name).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following table maps the POSIX character class names, the escapes and the old and new Unicode property mappings:<div class="spacer">

to true your environment when testing.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>@INC reorganization</h2> In @INC, ARCHLIB and PRIVLIB now occur after after the current version's site_perl and vendor_perl.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Switch statement changes</h2> The handling of complex expressions by the &quot;given&quot;/&quot;when&quot; switch statement has been enhanced. These enhancements are also available in 5.10.1 and subsequent 5.10 releases. There are two new cases where &quot;when&quot; now interprets its argument as a boolean, instead of an expression to be used in a smart match:<dl>
<dt>
flip-flop operators</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;..&quot; and &quot;...&quot; flip-flop operators are now evaluated in boolean context, following their usual semantics; see &quot;Range Operators&quot; in perlop.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that, as in perl 5.10.0, &quot;when (1..10)&quot; will not work to test whether a given value is an integer between 1 and 10; you should use &quot;when ([1..10])&quot; instead (note the array reference).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
However, contrary to 5.10.0, evaluating the flip-flop operators in boolean context ensures it can now be useful in a &quot;when()&quot;, notably for implementing bistable conditions, like in:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    when (/^=begin/ .. /^=end/) {<br/>
      # do something<br/>
    }<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
defined-or operator</dt>
<dd>
A compound expression involving the defined-or operator, as in &quot;when (expr1 // expr2)&quot;, will be treated as boolean if the first expression is boolean. (This just extends the existing rule that applies to the regular or operator, as in &quot;when (expr1 || expr2)&quot;.)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The next section details more changes brought to the semantics to the smart match operator, that naturally also modify the behaviour of the switch statements where smart matching is implicitly used. These changers were also made for the 5.10.1 release, and will remain in subsequent 5.10 releases.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Smart match changes</h2>  <i>Changes to type-based dispatch</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The smart match operator &quot;~~&quot; is no longer commutative. The behaviour of a smart match now depends primarily on the type of its right hand argument. Moreover, its semantics have been adjusted for greater consistency or usefulness in several cases. While the general backwards compatibility is maintained, several changes must be noted:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Code references with an empty prototype are no longer treated specially. They are passed an argument like the other code references (even if they choose to ignore it).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;%hash ~~ sub {}&quot; and &quot;@array ~~ sub {}&quot; now test that the subroutine returns a true value for each key of the hash (or element of the array), instead of passing the whole hash or array as a reference to the subroutine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Due to the commutativity breakage, code references are no longer treated specially when appearing on the left of the &quot;~~&quot; operator, but like any vulgar scalar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;undef ~~ %hash&quot; is always false (since &quot;undef&quot; can't be a key in a hash). No implicit conversion to &quot;&quot; is done (as was the case in perl 5.10.0).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;$scalar ~~ @array&quot; now always distributes the smart match across the elements of the array. It's true if one element in @array verifies &quot;$scalar ~~ $element&quot;. This is a generalization of the old behaviour that tested whether the array contained the scalar.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The full dispatch table for the smart match operator is given in &quot;Smart matching in detail&quot; in perlsyn.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Smart match and overloading</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
According to the rule of dispatch based on the rightmost argument type, when an object overloading &quot;~~&quot; appears on the right side of the operator, the overload routine will always be called (with a 3rd argument set to a true value, see overload.) However, when the object will appear on the left, the overload routine will be called only when the rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way distributivity of smart match across arrays is not broken, as well as the other behaviours with complex types (coderefs, hashes, regexes). Thus, writers of overloading routines for smart match mostly need to worry only with comparing against a scalar, and possibly with stringification overloading; the other common cases will be automatically handled consistently.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;~~&quot; will now refuse to work on objects that do not overload it (in order to avoid relying on the object's underlying structure). (However, if the object overloads the stringification or the numification operators, and if overload fallback is active, it will be used instead, as usual.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Labels can't be keywords</h2> Labels used as targets for the &quot;goto&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, &quot;next&quot; or &quot;redo&quot; statements cannot be keywords anymore. This restriction will prevent potential confusion between the &quot;goto LABEL&quot; and &quot;goto EXPR&quot; syntaxes: for example, a statement like &quot;goto print&quot; would jump to a label whose name would be the return value of &quot;print()&quot;, (usually 1), instead of a label named &quot;print&quot;. Moreover, the other control flow statements would just ignore any keyword passed to them as a label name. Since such labels cannot be defined anymore, this kind of error will be avoided.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Other incompatible changes</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The semantics of &quot;use feature :5.10*&quot; have changed slightly. See &quot;Modules and Pragmata&quot; for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
It is now a run-time error to use the smart match operator &quot;~~&quot; with an object that has no overload defined for it. (This way &quot;~~&quot; will not break encapsulation by matching against the object's internal representation as a reference.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The version control system used for the development of the perl interpreter has been switched from Perforce to git.  This is mainly an internal issue that only affects people actively working on the perl core; but it may have minor external visibility, for example in some of details of the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;. See perlrepository for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The internal structure of the &quot;ext/&quot; directory in the perl source has been reorganised. In general, a module &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; whose source was stored under  <i>ext/Foo/Bar/</i> is now located under <i>ext/Foo-Bar/</i>. Also, nearly all dual-life modules have been moved from  <i>lib/</i> to <i>ext/</i>. This is purely a source tarball change, and should make no difference to the compilation or installation of perl, unless you have a very customised build process that explicitly relies on this structure, or which hard-codes the &quot;nonxs_ext&quot;  <i>Configure</i> parameter. Specifically, this change does not by default alter the location of any files in the final installation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
As part of the &quot;Test::Harness&quot; 2.x to 3.x upgrade, the experimental &quot;Test::Harness::Straps&quot; module has been removed. See &quot;Updated Modules&quot; for more details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
As part of the &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; upgrade, the &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::bytes&quot; and &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::vmsish&quot; modules have been removed from this distribution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;Module::CoreList&quot; no longer contains the %:patchlevel hash.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
This one is actually a change introduced in 5.10.0, but it was missed from that release's perldelta, so it is mentioned here instead.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A bugfix related to the handling of the &quot;/m&quot; modifier and &quot;qr&quot; resulted in a change of behaviour between 5.8.x and 5.10.0:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    # matches in 5.8.x, doesn't match in 5.10.0<br/>
    $re = qr/^bar/; &quot;foo\nbar&quot; =~ /$re/m;<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;length undef&quot; now returns undef.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Unsupported private C API functions are now declared &quot;static&quot; to prevent leakage to Perl's public API.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
To support the bootstrapping process, <i>miniperl</i> no longer builds with UTF-8 support in the regexp engine.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This allows a build to complete with PERL_UNICODE set and a UTF-8 locale. Without this there's a bootstrapping problem, as miniperl can't load the UTF-8 components of the regexp engine, because they're not yet built.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>miniperl</i>'s @INC is now restricted to just -I..., the split of $ENV{PERL5LIB}, and &quot;.&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A space or a newline is now required after a &quot;#line XXX&quot; directive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Tied filehandles now have an additional method EOF which provides the EOF type</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
To better match all other flow control statements, &quot;foreach&quot; may no longer be used as an attribute.</dd>

<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode Character Database 5.1.0</h2> The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.11.0 has been updated to 5.1.0 from 5.0.0. See &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/#Notable_Changes&gt; for the notable changes.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>A proper interface for pluggable Method Resolution Orders</h2> As of Perl 5.11.0 there is a new interface for plugging and using method resolution orders other than the default (linear depth first search). The C3 method resolution order added in 5.10.0 has been re-implemented as a plugin, without changing its Perl-space interface. See perlmroapi for more information.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The &quot;overloading&quot; pragma</h2> This pragma allows you to lexically disable or enable overloading for some or all operations. (Yuval Kogman)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;\N&quot; regex escape</h2> A new regex escape has been added, &quot;\N&quot;. It will match any character that is not a newline, independently from the presence or absence of the single line match modifier &quot;/s&quot;. (If &quot;\N&quot; is followed by an opening brace and by a letter, perl will still assume that a Unicode character name is coming, so compatibility is preserved.) (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Implicit strictures</h2> Using the &quot;use VERSION&quot; syntax with a version number greater or equal to 5.11.0 will also lexically enable strictures just like &quot;use strict&quot; would do (in addition to enabling features.) So, the following:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use 5.11.0;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
will now imply:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use strict;<br/>
    use feature ':5.11';<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Parallel tests</h2> The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on Unix-like platforms. Instead of running &quot;make test&quot;, set &quot;TEST_JOBS&quot; in your environment to the number of tests to run in parallel, and run &quot;make test_harness&quot;. On a Bourne-like shell, this can be done as<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness  # Run 3 tests in parallel<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
An environment variable is used, rather than parallel make itself, because TAP::Harness needs to be able to schedule individual non-conflicting test scripts itself, and there is no standard interface to &quot;make&quot; utilities to interact with their job schedulers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that currently some test scripts may fail when run in parallel (most notably &quot;ext/IO/t/io_dir.t&quot;). If necessary run just the failing scripts again sequentially and see if the failures go away.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The &quot;...&quot; operator</h2> A new operator, &quot;...&quot;, nicknamed the Yada Yada operator, has been added. It is intended to mark placeholder code, that is not yet implemented. See &quot;Yada Yada Operator&quot; in perlop. (chromatic)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>DTrace support</h2> Some support for DTrace has been added. See &quot;DTrace support&quot; in  <i>INSTALL</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Support for &quot;configure_requires&quot; in CPAN module metadata</h2> Both &quot;CPAN&quot; and &quot;CPANPLUS&quot; now support the &quot;configure_requires&quot; keyword in the  <i>META.yml</i> metadata file included in most recent CPAN distributions. This allows distribution authors to specify configuration prerequisites that must be installed before running  <i>Makefile.PL</i> or <i>Build.PL</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the documentation for &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; or &quot;Module::Build&quot; for more on how to specify &quot;configure_requires&quot; when creating a distribution for CPAN.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;each&quot; is now more flexible</h2> The &quot;each&quot; function can now operate on arrays.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Y2038 compliance</h2> Perl's core time-related functions are now Y2038 compliant. (With 29 years to spare!)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>$, flexibility</h2> The variable $, may now be tied.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>// in where clauses</h2> // now behaves like || in when clauses</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Enabling warnings from your shell environment</h2> You can now set &quot;-W&quot; from the &quot;PERL5OPT&quot; environment variable</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;delete local&quot;</h2> &quot;delete local&quot; now allows you to locally delete a hash entry.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New support for Abstract namespace sockets</h2> Abstract namespace sockets are Linux-specific socket type that live in AF_UNIX family, slightly abusing it to be able to use arbitrary character arrays as addresses: They start with nul byte and are not terminated by nul byte, but with the length passed to the  <i>socket()</i> system call.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Modules and Pragmata</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Dual-lifed modules moved</h2> Dual-lifed modules maintained primarily in the Perl core now live in dist/. Dual-lifed modules maintained primarily on CPAN now live in cpan/<div class="spacer">
</div>
In previous releases of Perl, it was customary to enumerate all module changes in this section of the &quot;perldelta&quot; file.   From 5.11.0 forward only notable updates (such as new or deprecated modules ) will be listed in this section. For a complete reference to the versions of modules shipped in a given release of perl, please see Module::CoreList.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New Modules and Pragmata</h2><dl>
<dt>
&quot;autodie&quot;</dt>
<dd>
This is a new lexically-scoped alternative for the &quot;Fatal&quot; module. The bundled version is 2.06_01. Note that in this release, using a string eval when &quot;autodie&quot; is in effect can cause the autodie behaviour to leak into the surrounding scope. See &quot;BUGS&quot; in autodie for more details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;Compress::Raw::Bzip2&quot;</dt>
<dd>
This has been added to the core (version 2.020).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;parent&quot;</dt>
<dd>
This pragma establishes an ISA relationship with base classes at compile time. It provides the key feature of &quot;base&quot; without the feature creep.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;Parse::CPAN::Meta&quot;</dt>
<dd>
This has been added to the core (version 1.39).</dd>

See &quot;The &quot;overloading&quot; pragma&quot; above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;attrs&quot;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;attrs&quot; pragma has been removed. It had been marked as deprecated since 5.6.0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;charnames&quot;</dt>
<dd>
The Unicode <i>NameAliases.txt</i> database file has been added. This has the effect of adding some extra &quot;\N&quot; character names that formerly wouldn't have been recognised; for example, &quot;\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER GHA}&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;feature&quot;</dt>
<dd>
The meaning of the &quot;:5.10&quot; and &quot;:5.10.X&quot; feature bundles has changed slightly. The last component, if any (i.e. &quot;X&quot;) is simply ignored. This is predicated on the assumption that new features will not, in general, be added to maintenance releases. So &quot;:5.10&quot; and &quot;:5.10.X&quot; have identical effect. This is a change to the behaviour documented for 5.10.0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;mro&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Upgraded from version 1.00 to 1.01. Performance for single inheritance is 40% faster - see &quot;Performance Enhancements&quot; below.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;mro&quot; is now implemented as an XS extension. The documented interface has not changed. Code relying on the implementation detail that some &quot;mro::&quot; methods happened to be available at all times gets to &quot;keep both pieces&quot;.</dd>

&quot;Test::Harness&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Upgraded from version 2.64 to 3.17.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Note that one side-effect of the 2.x to 3.x upgrade is that the experimental &quot;Test::Harness::Straps&quot; module (and its supporting &quot;Assert&quot;, &quot;Iterator&quot;, &quot;Point&quot; and &quot;Results&quot; modules) have been removed. If you still need this, then they are available in the (unmaintained) &quot;Test-Harness-Straps&quot; distribution on CPAN.</dd>

Perl 5.11.0 added a new utility <i>perlthanks</i>, which is a variant of  <i>perlbug</i>, but for sending non-bug-reports to the authors and maintainers of Perl. Getting nothing but bug reports can become a bit demoralising: we'll see if this changes things.</dd>

<h1>Changes to Existing Documentation</h1> The various large  <i>Changes*</i> files (which listed every change made to perl over the last 18 years) have been removed, and replaced by a small file, also called  <i>Changes</i>, which just explains how that same information may be extracted from the git version control system.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The file <i>Porting/patching.pod</i> has been deleted, as it mainly described interacting with the old Perforce-based repository, which is now obsolete. Information still relevant has been moved to perlrepository.<div class="spacer">
</div>
perlapi, perlintern, perlmodlib and perltoc are now all generated at build time, rather than being shipped as part of the release.<dl>

<h1>Performance Enhancements</h1><dl>

<dd>
A new internal cache means that &quot;isa()&quot; will often be faster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The implementation of &quot;C3&quot; Method Resolution Order has been optimised - linearisation for classes with single inheritance is 40% faster. Performance for multiple inheritance is unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Under &quot;use locale&quot;, the locale-relevant information is now cached on read-only values, such as the list returned by &quot;keys %hash&quot;. This makes operations such as &quot;sort keys %hash&quot; in the scope of &quot;use locale&quot; much faster.</dd>

<h1>Installation and Configuration Improvements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2><i>ext/</i> reorganisation</h2> The layout of directories in  <i>ext</i> has been revised. Specifically, all extensions are now flat, and at the top level, with &quot;/&quot; in pathnames replaced by &quot;-&quot;, so that  <i>ext/Data/Dumper/</i> is now <i>ext/Data-Dumper/</i>, etc.  The names of the extensions as specified to  <i>Configure</i>, and as reported by %Config::Config under the keys &quot;dynamic_ext&quot;, &quot;known_extensions&quot;, &quot;nonxs_ext&quot; and &quot;static_ext&quot; have not changed, and still use &quot;/&quot;. Hence this change will not have any affect once perl is installed. &quot;Safe&quot; has been split out from being part of &quot;Opcode&quot;, and &quot;mro&quot; is now an extension in its own right.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Nearly all dual-life modules have been moved from <i>lib</i> to <i>ext</i>, and will now appear as known &quot;nonxs_ext&quot;. This will made no difference to the structure of an installed perl, nor will the modules installed differ, unless you run  <i>Configure</i> with options to specify an exact list of extensions to build. In this case, you will rapidly become aware that you need to add to your list, because various modules needed to complete the build, such as &quot;ExtUtils::ParseXS&quot;, have now become extensions, and without them the build will fail well before it attempts to run the regression tests.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Configuration improvements</h2> If &quot;vendorlib&quot; and &quot;vendorarch&quot; are the same, then they are only added to @INC once.<div class="spacer">
</div>
$Config{usedevel} and the C-level &quot;PERL_USE_DEVEL&quot; are now defined if perl is built with  &quot;-Dusedevel&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Configure</i> will enable use of &quot;-fstack-protector&quot;, to provide protection against stack-smashing attacks, if the compiler supports it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Configure</i> will now determine the correct prototypes for re-entrant functions, and for &quot;gconvert&quot;, if you are using a C++ compiler rather than a C compiler.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On Unix, if you build from a tree containing a git repository, the configuration process will note the commit hash you have checked out, for display in the output of &quot;perl -v&quot; and &quot;perl -V&quot;. Unpushed local commits are automatically added to the list of local patches displayed by &quot;perl -V&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Compilation improvements</h2> As part of the flattening of  <i>ext</i>, all extensions on all platforms are built by  <i>make_ext.pl</i>. This replaces the Unix-specific  <i>ext/util/make_ext</i>, VMS-specific <i>make_ext.com</i> and Win32-specific  <i>win32/buildext.pl</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Platform Specific Changes</h2><dl>
<dt>
AIX</dt>
<dd>

Improved message window handling means that &quot;alarm&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; messages will no longer be dropped under race conditions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
VMS</dt>
<dd>
Reads from the in-memory temporary files of &quot;PerlIO::scalar&quot; used to fail if $/ was set to a numeric reference (to indicate record-style reads). This is now fixed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
VMS now supports &quot;getgrgid&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Many improvements and cleanups have been made to the VMS file name handling and conversion code.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Enabling the &quot;PERL_VMS_POSIX_EXIT&quot; logical name now encodes a POSIX exit status in a VMS condition value for better interaction with GNV's bash shell and other utilities that depend on POSIX exit values.  See &quot;$?&quot; in perlvms for details.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;File::Copy&quot; now detects Unix compatibility mode on VMS.</dd>

<h1>Selected Bug Fixes</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;-I&quot; on shebang line now adds directories in front of @INC as documented, and as does &quot;-I&quot; when specified on the command-line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;kill&quot; is now fatal when called on non-numeric process identifiers. Previously, an 'undef' process identifier would be interpreted as a request to kill process &quot;0&quot;, which would terminate the current process group on POSIX systems.  Since process identifiers are always integers, killing a non-numeric process is now fatal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
5.10.0 inadvertently disabled an optimisation, which caused a measurable performance drop in list assignment, such as is often used to assign function parameters from @_. The optimisation has been re-instated, and the performance regression fixed.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;-i&quot;<i>.suffix</i> command-line switch now recreates the file using restricted permissions, before changing its mode to match the original file. This eliminates a potential race condition [RT #60904].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

Bitwise operations on references could crash the interpreter, e.g. &quot;$x=\$y; $x |= &quot;foo&quot;&quot; [RT #54956].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Patterns including alternation might be sensitive to the internal UTF-8 representation, e.g.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $byte = chr(192);<br/>
    my $utf8 = chr(192); utf8::upgrade($utf8);<br/>
    $utf8 =~ /$byte|X}/i;       # failed in 5.10.0<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Within UTF8-encoded Perl source files (i.e. where &quot;use utf8&quot; is in effect), double-quoted literal strings could be corrupted where a &quot;\xNN&quot;, &quot;\0NNN&quot; or &quot;\N{}&quot; is followed by a literal character with ordinal value greater than 255 [RT #59908].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;B::Deparse&quot; failed to correctly deparse various constructs: &quot;readpipe STRING&quot; [RT #62428], &quot;CORE::require(STRING)&quot; [RT #62488], &quot;sub foo(_)&quot; [RT #62484].</dd>

<dd>
Using &quot;setpgrp&quot; with no arguments could corrupt the perl stack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The block form of &quot;eval&quot; is now specifically trappable by &quot;Safe&quot; and &quot;ops&quot;.  Previously it was erroneously treated like string &quot;eval&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In 5.10.0, the two characters &quot;[~&quot; were sometimes parsed as the smart match operator (&quot;~~&quot;) [RT #63854].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In 5.10.0, the &quot;*&quot; quantifier in patterns was sometimes treated as &quot;{0,32767}&quot; [RT #60034, #60464]. For example, this match would fail:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Using &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot; to exit a &quot;given&quot; block no longer produces a spurious warning like the following:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    Exiting given via last at foo.pl line 123<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
On Windows, '.\foo' and '..\foo'  were treated differently than './foo' and '../foo' by &quot;do&quot; and &quot;require&quot; [RT #63492].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Assigning a format to a glob could corrupt the format; e.g.:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<br/>
     *bar=*foo{FORMAT}; # foo format now bad<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>

Using an array &quot;tie&quot; inside in array &quot;tie&quot; could SEGV. This has been fixed. [RT #51636]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A race condition inside &quot;PerlIOStdio_close()&quot; has been identified and fixed. This used to cause various threading issues, including SEGVs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In &quot;unpack&quot;, the use of &quot;()&quot; groups in scalar context was internally placing a list on the interpreter's stack, which manifested in various ways, including SEGVs.  This is now fixed [RT #50256].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Magic was called twice in &quot;substr&quot;, &quot;\&amp;$x&quot;, &quot;tie $x, $m&quot; and &quot;chop&quot;. These have all been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A 5.10.0 optimisation to clear the temporary stack within the implicit loop of &quot;s///ge&quot; has been reverted, as it turned out to be the cause of obscure bugs in seemingly unrelated parts of the interpreter [commit ef0d4e17921ee3de].</dd>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;binmode STDIN, ':raw'&quot; could lead to segmentation faults on some platforms. This has been fixed [RT #54828].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
An off-by-one error meant that &quot;index $str, ...&quot; was effectively being executed as &quot;index &quot;$str\0&quot;, ...&quot;. This has been fixed [RT #53746].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>
&quot;-C&quot; on the shebang (&quot;#!&quot;) line is once more permitted if it is also specified on the command line. &quot;-C&quot; on the shebang line used to be a silent no-op  <i>if</i> it was not also on the command line, so perl 5.10.0 disallowed it, which broke some scripts. Now perl checks whether it is also on the command line and only dies if it is not [RT #67880].</dd>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The function &quot;Perl_newSVpvn_flags()&quot; has been added, equivalent to &quot;Perl_newSVpvn()&quot; and then performing the action relevant to the flag.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

&quot;SVf_UTF8&quot;</dt>
<dd>
This will call &quot;SvUTF8_on()&quot; for you. (Note that this does not convert an sequence of ISO 8859-1 characters to UTF-8). A wrapper, &quot;newSVpvn_utf8()&quot; is available for this.</dd>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;PL_na&quot; has been exterminated from the core code, replaced by local STRLEN temporaries, or &quot;*_nolen()&quot; calls. Either approach is faster than &quot;PL_na&quot;, which is a pointer deference into the interpreter structure under ithreads, and a global variable otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;Perl_mg_free()&quot; used to leave freed memory accessible via &quot;SvMAGIC()&quot; on the scalar. It now updates the linked list to remove each piece of magic as it is freed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>

Under ithreads, the regex in &quot;PL_reg_curpm&quot; is now reference counted. This eliminates a lot of hackish workarounds to cope with it not being reference counted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>

&quot;Perl_mg_magical()&quot; would sometimes incorrectly turn on &quot;SvRMAGICAL()&quot;. This has been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The <i>public</i> IV and NV flags are now not set if the string value has trailing &quot;garbage&quot;. This behaviour is consistent with not setting the public IV or NV flags if the value is out of range for the type.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
SV allocation tracing has been added to the diagnostics enabled by &quot;-Dm&quot;. The tracing can alternatively output via the &quot;PERL_MEM_LOG&quot; mechanism, if that was enabled when the  <i>perl</i> binary was compiled.</dd>

Smartmatch resolution tracing has been added as a new diagnostic. Use &quot;-DM&quot; to enable it.</dd>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Uses of &quot;Nullav&quot;, &quot;Nullcv&quot;, &quot;Nullhv&quot;, &quot;Nullop&quot;, &quot;Nullsv&quot; etc have been replaced by &quot;NULL&quot; in the core code, and non-dual-life modules, as &quot;NULL&quot; is clearer to those unfamiliar with the core code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A macro MUTABLE_PTR(p) has been added, which on (non-pedantic) gcc will not cast away &quot;const&quot;, returning a &quot;void *&quot;. Macros &quot;MUTABLE_SV(av)&quot;, &quot;MUTABLE_SV(cv)&quot; etc build on this, casting to &quot;AV *&quot; etc without casting away &quot;const&quot;. This allows proper compile-time auditing of &quot;const&quot; correctness in the core, and helped picked up some errors (now fixed).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Macros &quot;mPUSHs()&quot; and &quot;mXPUSHs()&quot; have been added, for pushing SVs on the stack and mortalizing them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Use of the private structure &quot;mro_meta&quot; has changed slightly. Nothing outside the core should be accessing this directly anyway.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A new tool, <i>Porting/expand-macro.pl</i> has been added, that allows you to view how a C preprocessor macro would be expanded when compiled. This is handy when trying to decode the macro hell that is the perl guts.</dd>

<h1>New Tests</h1> Many modules updated from CPAN incorporate new tests.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Several tests that have the potential to hang forever if they fail now incorporate a &quot;watchdog&quot; functionality that will kill them after a timeout, which helps ensure that &quot;make test&quot; and &quot;make test_harness&quot; run to completion automatically.

<h1>Known Problems</h1> This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions from either 5.10.0 or 5.8.x.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;List::Util::first&quot; misbehaves in the presence of a lexical $_ (typically introduced by &quot;my $_&quot; or implicitly by &quot;given&quot;). The variable which gets set for each iteration is the package variable $_, not the lexical $_ [RT #67694].<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A similar issue may occur in other modules that provide functions which take a block as their first argument, like<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    foo { ... $_ ...} list<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;charnames&quot; pragma may generate a run-time error when a regex is interpolated [RT #56444]:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use charnames ':full';<br/>
    my $r1 = qr/\N{THAI CHARACTER SARA I}/;<br/>
    &quot;foo&quot; =~ $r1;    # okay<br/>
    &quot;foo&quot; =~ /$r1+/; # runtime error<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A workaround is to generate the character outside of the regex:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $a = &quot;\N{THAI CHARACTER SARA I}&quot;;<br/>
    my $r1 = qr/$a/;<br/>

&quot;Switch&quot; is buggy and should be avoided. From perl 5.11.0 onwards, it is intended that any use of the core version of this module will emit a warning, and that the module will eventually be removed from the core (probably in perl 5.14.0). See &quot;Switch statements&quot; in perlsyn for its replacement.</dd>
