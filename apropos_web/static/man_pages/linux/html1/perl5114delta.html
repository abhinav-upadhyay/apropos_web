<h1>NAME</h1> perl5114delta - what is new for perl v5.11.4</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.11.3 release and the 5.11.4 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.11.2, first read perl5113delta, which describes differences between 5.11.2 and 5.11.3.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Version number formats</h2> Acceptable version number formats have been formalized into &quot;strict&quot; and &quot;lax&quot; rules.  &quot;package NAME VERSION&quot; takes a strict version number.  &quot;use NAME VERSION&quot; takes a lax version number.  &quot;UNIVERSAL::VERSION&quot; and the version object constructors take lax version numbers.  Providing an invalid version will result in a fatal error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These formats will be documented fully in the version module in a subsequent release of Perl 5.11.  To a first approximation, a &quot;strict&quot; version number is a positive decimal number (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal v-string with a leading 'v' character and at least three components.  A &quot;lax&quot; version number allows v-strings with fewer than three components or without a leading 'v'.  Under &quot;lax&quot; rules, both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a trailing &quot;alpha&quot; component separated by an underscore character after a fractional or dotted-decimal component.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The version module adds &quot;version::is_strict&quot; and &quot;version::is_lax&quot; functions to check a scalar against these rules.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode properties</h2> &quot;\p{XDigit}&quot; now matches the same characters as &quot;\p{Hex_Digit}&quot;.  This means that in addition to the characters it currently matches, &quot;[A-Fa-f0-9]&quot;, it will also match their fullwidth equivalent forms, for example U+FF10: FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO.</div>

The two warnings :<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<br/>
  Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s<br/>
  Prototype after '%c' for %s : %s<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
have been moved from the &quot;syntax&quot; top-level warnings category into a new first-level category, &quot;illegalproto&quot;. These two warnings are currently the only ones emitted during parsing of an invalid/illegal prototype, so one can now do<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  no warnings 'illegalproto';<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
to suppress only those, but not other syntax-related warnings. Warnings where prototypes are changed, ignored, or not met are still in the &quot;prototype&quot; category as before. (Matt S. Trout)</dd>

<h1>Known Problems</h1> Perl 5.11.4 is a development release leading up to Perl 5.12.0. Some notable known problems found in 5.11.4 are listed as dependencies of RT #69710, the Perl 5 version 12 meta-ticket.</div>

<h1>Deprecations</h1> The following items are now deprecated.<dl>
<dt>
&quot;UNIVERSAL-&gt;import()&quot;</dt>
<dd>
The method &quot;UNIVERSAL-&gt;import()&quot; is now deprecated.  Attempting to pass import arguments to a &quot;use UNIVERSAL&quot; statement will result in a deprecation warning. (This is a less noisy version of the full deprecation warning added in 5.11.0.)</dd>

<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at &lt;http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/&gt;.  There may also be information at &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt;, the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analyzed by the Perl porting team.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</div>
