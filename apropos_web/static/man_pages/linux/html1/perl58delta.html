<h1>NAME</h1> perl58delta - what is new for perl v5.8.0</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.6.0 release and the 5.8.0 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Many of the bug fixes in 5.8.0 were already seen in the 5.6.1 maintenance release since the two releases were kept closely coordinated (while 5.8.0 was still called 5.7.something).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Changes that were integrated into the 5.6.1 release are marked &quot;[561]&quot;. Many of these changes have been further developed since 5.6.1 was released, those are marked &quot;[561+]&quot;.<div class="spacer">

You can see the list of changes in the 5.6.1 release (both from the 5.005_03 release and the 5.6.0 release) by reading perl561delta.</div>

<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Binary Incompatibility</h2>  <b>Perl 5.8 is not binary compatible with earlier releases of Perl.</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>You have to recompile your XS modules.</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
(Pure Perl modules should continue to work.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The major reason for the discontinuity is the new IO architecture called PerlIO.  PerlIO is the default configuration because without it many new features of Perl 5.8 cannot be used.  In other words: you just have to recompile your modules containing XS code, sorry about that.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In future releases of Perl, non-PerlIO aware XS modules may become completely unsupported.  This shouldn't be too difficult for module authors, however: PerlIO has been designed as a drop-in replacement (at the source code level) for the stdio interface.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Depending on your platform, there are also other reasons why we decided to break binary compatibility, please read on.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>64-bit platforms and malloc</h2> If your pointers are 64 bits wide, the Perl malloc is no longer being used because it does not work well with 8-byte pointers.  Also, usually the system mallocs on such platforms are much better optimized for such large memory models than the Perl malloc.  Some memory-hungry Perl applications like the PDL don't work well with Perl's malloc. Finally, other applications than Perl (such as mod_perl) tend to prefer the system malloc.  Such platforms include Alpha and 64-bit HPPA, MIPS, PPC, and Sparc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>AIX Dynaloading</h2> The AIX dynaloading now uses in AIX releases 4.3 and newer the native dlopen interface of AIX instead of the old emulated interface.  This change will probably break backward compatibility with compiled modules.  The change was made to make Perl more compliant with other applications like mod_perl which are using the AIX native interface.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Attributes for &quot;my&quot; variables now handled at run-time</h2> The &quot;my EXPR : ATTRS&quot; syntax now applies variable attributes at run-time.  (Subroutine and &quot;our&quot; variables still get attributes applied at compile-time.)  See attributes for additional details.  In particular, however, this allows variable attributes to be useful for &quot;tie&quot; interfaces, which was a deficiency of earlier releases.  Note that the new semantics doesn't work with the Attribute::Handlers module (as of version 0.76).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Socket Extension Dynamic in VMS</h2> The Socket extension is now dynamically loaded instead of being statically built in.  This may or may not be a problem with ancient TCP/IP stacks of VMS: we do not know since we weren't able to test Perl in such configurations.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>IEEE-format Floating Point Default on OpenVMS Alpha</h2> Perl now uses IEEE format (T_FLOAT) as the default internal floating point format on OpenVMS Alpha, potentially breaking binary compatibility with external libraries or existing data.  G_FLOAT is still available as a configuration option.  The default on VAX (D_FLOAT) has not changed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New Unicode Semantics (no more &quot;use utf8&quot;, almost)</h2> Previously in Perl 5.6 to use Unicode one would say &quot;use utf8&quot; and then the operations (like string concatenation) were Unicode-aware in that lexical scope.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This was found to be an inconvenient interface, and in Perl 5.8 the Unicode model has completely changed: now the &quot;Unicodeness&quot; is bound to the data itself, and for most of the time &quot;use utf8&quot; is not needed at all.  The only remaining use of &quot;use utf8&quot; is when the Perl script itself has been written in the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode.  (UTF-8 has not been made the default since there are many Perl scripts out there that are using various national eight-bit character sets, which would be illegal in UTF-8.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
See perluniintro for the explanation of the current model, and utf8 for the current use of the utf8 pragma.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New Unicode Properties</h2> Unicode  <i>scripts</i> are now supported. Scripts are similar to (and superior to) Unicode  <i>blocks</i>. The difference between scripts and blocks is that scripts are the glyphs used by a language or a group of languages, while the blocks are more artificial groupings of (mostly) 256 characters based on the Unicode numbering.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In general, scripts are more inclusive, but not universally so. For example, while the script &quot;Latin&quot; includes all the Latin characters and their various diacritic-adorned versions, it does not include the various punctuation or digits (since they are not solely &quot;Latin&quot;).<div class="spacer">
</div>
A number of other properties are now supported, including &quot;\p{L&amp;}&quot;, &quot;\p{Any}&quot; &quot;\p{Assigned}&quot;, &quot;\p{Unassigned}&quot;, &quot;\p{Blank}&quot; [561] and &quot;\p{SpacePerl}&quot; [561] (along with their &quot;\P{...}&quot; versions, of course). See perlunicode for details, and more additions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;In&quot; or &quot;Is&quot; prefix to names used with the &quot;\p{...}&quot; and &quot;\P{...}&quot; are now almost always optional. The only exception is that a &quot;In&quot; prefix is required to signify a Unicode block when a block name conflicts with a script name. For example, &quot;\p{Tibetan}&quot; refers to the script, while &quot;\p{InTibetan}&quot; refers to the block. When there is no name conflict, you can omit the &quot;In&quot; from the block name (e.g. &quot;\p{BraillePatterns}&quot;), but to be safe, it's probably best to always use the &quot;In&quot;).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>REF(...) Instead Of SCALAR(...)</h2> A reference to a reference now stringifies as &quot;REF(0x81485ec)&quot; instead of &quot;SCALAR(0x81485ec)&quot; in order to be more consistent with the return value of  <i>ref()</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>pack/unpack D/F recycled</h2> The undocumented pack/unpack template letters D/F have been recycled for better use: now they stand for long double (if supported by the platform) and NV (Perl internal floating point type).  (They used to be aliases for d/f, but you never knew that.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>glob()</i> now returns filenames in alphabetical order</h2> The list of filenames from  <i>glob()</i> (or &lt;...&gt;) is now by default sorted alphabetically to be csh-compliant (which is what happened before in most Unix platforms).  ( <i>bsd_glob()</i> does still sort platform natively, ASCII or EBCDIC, unless GLOB_ALPHASORT is specified.) [561]</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Deprecations</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The semantics of bless(REF, REF) were unclear and until someone proves it to make some sense, it is forbidden.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The obsolete chat2 library that should never have been allowed to escape the laboratory has been decommissioned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Using chdir(&quot;&quot;) or chdir(undef) instead of explicit <i>chdir()</i> is doubtful.  A failure (think chdir( <i>some_function()</i>) can lead into unintended  <i>chdir()</i> to the home directory, therefore this behaviour is deprecated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The builtin <i>dump()</i> function has probably outlived most of its usefulness.  The core-dumping functionality will remain in future available as an explicit call to &quot;CORE::dump()&quot;, but in future releases the behaviour of an unqualified &quot;dump()&quot; call may change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The very dusty examples in the eg/ directory have been removed. Suggestions for new shiny examples welcome but the main issue is that the examples need to be documented, tested and (most importantly) maintained.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The (bogus) escape sequences \8 and \9 now give an optional warning (&quot;Unrecognized escape passed through&quot;).  There is no need to \-escape any &quot;\w&quot; character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The *glob{FILEHANDLE} is deprecated, use *glob{IO} instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;package;&quot; syntax (&quot;package&quot; without an argument) has been deprecated.  Its semantics were never that clear and its implementation even less so.  If you have used that feature to disallow all but fully qualified variables, &quot;use strict;&quot; instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The unimplemented POSIX regex features [[.cc.]] and [[=c=]] are still recognised but now cause fatal errors.  The previous behaviour of ignoring them by default and warning if requested was unacceptable since it, in a way, falsely promised that the features could be used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In future releases, non-PerlIO aware XS modules may become completely unsupported.  Since PerlIO is a drop-in replacement for stdio at the source code level, this shouldn't be that drastic a change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Previous versions of perl and some readings of some sections of Camel III implied that the &quot;:raw&quot; &quot;discipline&quot; was the inverse of &quot;:crlf&quot;. Turning off &quot;clrfness&quot; is no longer enough to make a stream truly binary. So the PerlIO &quot;:raw&quot; layer (or &quot;discipline&quot;, to use the Camel book's older terminology) is now formally defined as being equivalent to binmode(FH) - which is in turn defined as doing whatever is necessary to pass each byte as-is without any translation.  In particular binmode(FH) - and hence &quot;:raw&quot; - will now turn off both CRLF and UTF-8 translation and remove other layers (e.g. : <i>encoding()</i>) which would modify byte stream.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The current user-visible implementation of pseudo-hashes (the weird use of the first array element) is deprecated starting from Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in Perl 5.10.0, and the feature will be implemented differently.  Not only is the current interface rather ugly, but the current implementation slows down normal array and hash use quite noticeably. The &quot;fields&quot; pragma interface will remain available.  The  <i>restricted hashes</i> interface is expected to be the replacement interface (see Hash::Util).  If your existing programs depends on the underlying implementation, consider using Class::PseudoHash from CPAN.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The syntaxes &quot;@a-&gt;[...]&quot; and  &quot;%h-&gt;{...}&quot; have now been deprecated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
After years of trying, suidperl is considered to be too complex to ever be considered truly secure.  The suidperl functionality is likely to be removed in a future release.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The 5.005 threads model (module &quot;Thread&quot;) is deprecated and expected to be removed in Perl 5.10.  Multithreaded code should be migrated to the new ithreads model (see threads, threads::shared and perlthrtut).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The long deprecated uppercase aliases for the string comparison operators (EQ, NE, LT, LE, GE, GT) have now been removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The tr///C and tr///U features have been removed and will not return; the interface was a mistake.  Sorry about that.  For similar functionality, see pack('U0', ...) and pack('C0', ...). [561]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Earlier Perls treated &quot;sub foo (@bar)&quot; as equivalent to &quot;sub foo (@)&quot;. The prototypes are now checked better at compile-time for invalid syntax.  An optional warning is generated (&quot;Illegal character in prototype...&quot;)  but this may be upgraded to a fatal error in a future release.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;exec LIST&quot; and &quot;system LIST&quot; operations now produce warnings on tainted data and in some future release they will produce fatal errors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The existing behaviour when localising tied arrays and hashes is wrong, and will be changed in a future release, so do not rely on the existing behaviour. See &quot;Localising Tied Arrays and Hashes Is Broken&quot;.</dd>
</dl>

<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode Overhaul</h2> Unicode in general should be now much more usable than in Perl 5.6.0 (or even in 5.6.1).  Unicode can be used in hash keys, Unicode in regular expressions should work now, Unicode in tr/// should work now, Unicode in I/O should work now.  See perluniintro for introduction and perlunicode for details.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The Unicode Character Database coming with Perl has been upgraded to Unicode 3.2.0.  For more information, see http://www.unicode.org/ . [561+] (5.6.1 has UCD 3.0.1.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
For developers interested in enhancing Perl's Unicode capabilities: almost all the UCD files are included with the Perl distribution in the  <i>lib/unicore</i> subdirectory.  The most notable omission, for space considerations, is the Unihan database.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The properties \p{Blank} and \p{SpacePerl} have been added. &quot;Blank&quot; is like C  <i>isblank()</i>, that is, it contains only &quot;horizontal whitespace&quot; (the space character is, the newline isn't), and the &quot;SpacePerl&quot; is the Unicode equivalent of &quot;\s&quot; (\p{Space} isn't, since that includes the vertical tabulator character, whereas &quot;\s&quot; doesn't.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;New Unicode Properties&quot; earlier in this document for additional information on changes with Unicode properties.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>PerlIO is Now The Default</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
IO is now by default done via PerlIO rather than system's &quot;stdio&quot;. PerlIO allows &quot;layers&quot; to be &quot;pushed&quot; onto a file handle to alter the handle's behaviour.  Layers can be specified at open time via 3-arg form of open:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   open($fh,'&gt;:crlf :utf8', $path) || ...<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
or on already opened handles via extended &quot;binmode&quot;:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   binmode($fh,':encoding(iso-8859-7)');<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The built-in layers are: unix (low level read/write), stdio (as in previous Perls), perlio (re-implementation of stdio buffering in a portable manner), crlf (does CRLF &lt;=&gt; &quot;\n&quot; translation as on Win32, but available on any platform).  A mmap layer may be available if platform supports it (mostly Unixes).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Layers to be applied by default may be specified via the 'open' pragma.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;Installation and Configuration Improvements&quot; for the effects of PerlIO on your architecture name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
If your platform supports <i>fork()</i>, you can use the list form of &quot;open&quot; for pipes.  For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    open KID_PS, &quot;-|&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;aux&quot; or die $!;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
forks the <i>ps</i>(1) command (without spawning a shell, as there are more than three arguments to  <i>open()</i>), and reads its standard output via the &quot;KID_PS&quot; filehandle.  See perlipc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
File handles can be marked as accepting Perl's internal encoding of Unicode (UTF-8 or UTF-EBCDIC depending on platform) by a pseudo layer &quot;:utf8&quot; :<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   open($fh,&quot;&gt;:utf8&quot;,&quot;Uni.txt&quot;);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note for EBCDIC users: the pseudo layer &quot;:utf8&quot; is erroneously named for you since it's not UTF-8 what you will be getting but instead UTF-EBCDIC.  See perlunicode, utf8, and http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr16/ for more information. In future releases this naming may change.  See perluniintro for more information about UTF-8.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
If your environment variables (LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG) look like you want to use UTF-8 (any of the variables match &quot;/utf-?8/i&quot;), your STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR handles and the default open layer (see open) are marked as UTF-8.  (This feature, like other new features that combine Unicode and I/O, work only if you are using PerlIO, but that's the default.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that after this Perl really does assume that everything is UTF-8: for example if some input handle is not, Perl will probably very soon complain about the input data like this &quot;Malformed UTF-8 ...&quot; since any old eight-bit data is not legal UTF-8.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note for code authors: if you want to enable your users to use UTF-8 as their default encoding  but in your code still have eight-bit I/O streams (such as images or zip files), you need to explicitly  <i>open()</i> or <i>binmode()</i> with &quot;:bytes&quot; (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc), or you can just use &quot;binmode(FH)&quot; (nice for pre-5.8.0 backward compatibility).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
File handles can translate character encodings from/to Perl's internal Unicode form on read/write via the &quot;: <i>encoding()</i>&quot; layer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
File handles can be opened to &quot;in memory&quot; files held in Perl scalars via:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   open($fh,'&gt;', \$variable) || ...<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Anonymous temporary files are available without need to 'use FileHandle' or other module via<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   open($fh,&quot;+&gt;&quot;, undef) || ...<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
That is a literal undef, not an undefined value.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>ithreads</h2> The new interpreter threads (&quot;ithreads&quot; for short) implementation of multithreading, by Arthur Bergman, replaces the old &quot;5.005 threads&quot; implementation.  In the ithreads model any data sharing between threads must be explicit, as opposed to the model where data sharing was implicit.  See threads and threads::shared, and perlthrtut.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a part of the ithreads implementation Perl will also use any necessary and detectable reentrant libc interfaces.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Restricted Hashes</h2> A restricted hash is restricted to a certain set of keys, no keys outside the set can be added.  Also individual keys can be restricted so that the key cannot be deleted and the value cannot be changed. No new syntax is involved: the Hash::Util module is the interface.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Safe Signals</h2> Perl used to be fragile in that signals arriving at inopportune moments could corrupt Perl's internal state.  Now Perl postpones handling of signals until it's safe (between opcodes).<div class="spacer">
</div>
This change may have surprising side effects because signals no longer interrupt Perl instantly.  Perl will now first finish whatever it was doing, like finishing an internal operation (like  <i>sort()</i>) or an external operation (like an I/O operation), and only then look at any arrived signals (and before starting the next operation).  No more corrupt internal state since the current operation is always finished first, but the signal may take more time to get heard.  Note that breaking out from potentially blocking operations should still work, though.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Understanding of Numbers</h2> In general a lot of fixing has happened in the area of Perl's understanding of numbers, both integer and floating point.  Since in many systems the standard number parsing functions like &quot;strtoul()&quot; and &quot;atof()&quot; seem to have bugs, Perl tries to work around their deficiencies.  This results hopefully in more accurate numbers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl now tries internally to use integer values in numeric conversions and basic arithmetics (+ - * /) if the arguments are integers, and tries also to keep the results stored internally as integers. This change leads to often slightly faster and always less lossy arithmetics. (Previously Perl always preferred floating point numbers in its math.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings [561]</h2> In double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter what.  The behavior in earlier versions of perl 5 was that arrays would interpolate into strings if the array had been mentioned before the string was compiled, and otherwise Perl would raise a fatal compile-time error. In versions 5.000 through 5.003, the error was<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        Literal @example now requires backslash<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In versions 5.004_01 through 5.6.0, the error was<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        In string, @example now must be written as \@example<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The idea here was to get people into the habit of writing &quot;fred\@example.com&quot; when they wanted a literal &quot;@&quot; sign, just as they have always written &quot;Give me back my \$5&quot; when they wanted a literal &quot;$&quot; sign.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Starting with 5.6.1, when Perl now sees an &quot;@&quot; sign in a double-quoted string, it  <i>always</i> attempts to interpolate an array, regardless of whether or not the array has been used or declared already.  The fatal error has been downgraded to an optional warning:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        Possible unintended interpolation of @example in string<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This warns you that &quot;fred@example.com&quot; is going to turn into &quot;fred.com&quot; if you don't backslash the &quot;@&quot;. See http://perl.plover.com/at-error.html for more details about the history here.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Miscellaneous Changes</h2><dl>

AUTOLOAD is now lvaluable, meaning that you can add the :lvalue attribute to AUTOLOAD subroutines and you can assign to the AUTOLOAD return value.</dd>

The $Config{byteorder} (and corresponding BYTEORDER in config.h) was previously wrong in platforms if sizeof(long) was 4, but sizeof(IV) was 8.  The byteorder was only sizeof(long) bytes long (1234 or 4321), but now it is correctly sizeof(IV) bytes long, (12345678 or 87654321). (This problem didn't affect Windows platforms.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Also, $Config{byteorder} is now computed dynamically--this is more robust with &quot;fat binaries&quot; where an executable image contains binaries for more than one binary platform, and when cross-compiling.</dd>

<dd>
&quot;do&quot; followed by a bareword now ensures that this bareword isn't a keyword (to avoid a bug where &quot;do q(foo.pl)&quot; tried to call a subroutine called &quot;q&quot;).  This means that for example instead of &quot;do format()&quot; you must write &quot;do &amp;format()&quot;.</dd>

The builtin <i>dump()</i> now gives an optional warning &quot;dump() better written as CORE::dump()&quot;, meaning that by default &quot;dump(...)&quot; is resolved as the builtin  <i>dump()</i> which dumps core and aborts, not as (possibly) user-defined &quot;sub dump&quot;.

<h1>Performance Enhancements</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>map()</i> could get pathologically slow when the result list it generates is larger than the source list.  The performance has been improved for common scenarios. [561]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>sort()</i> is also fully reentrant, in the sense that the sort function can itself call  <i>sort()</i>.  This did not work reliably in previous releases. [561]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>sort()</i> has been changed to use primarily mergesort internally as opposed to the earlier quicksort.  For very small lists this may result in slightly slower sorting times, but in general the speedup should be at least 20%.  Additional bonuses are that the worst case behaviour of  <i>sort()</i> is now better (in computer science terms it now runs in time O(N log N), as opposed to quicksort's Theta(N**2) worst-case run time behaviour), and that  <i>sort()</i> is now stable (meaning that elements with identical keys will stay ordered as they were before the sort).  See the &quot;sort&quot; pragma for information.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The story in more detail: suppose you want to serve yourself a little slice of Pi.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    @digits = ( 3,1,4,1,5,9 );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A numerical sort of the digits will yield (1,1,3,4,5,9), as expected. Which 1 comes first is hard to know, since one 1 looks pretty much like any other.  You can regard this as totally trivial, or somewhat profound.  However, if you just want to sort the even digits ahead of the odd ones, then what will<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    sort { ($a % 2) &lt;=&gt; ($b % 2) } @digits;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
yield?  The only even digit, 4, will come first.  But how about the odd numbers, which all compare equal?  With the quicksort algorithm used to implement Perl 5.6 and earlier, the order of ties is left up to the sort.  So, as you add more and more digits of Pi, the order in which the sorted even and odd digits appear will change. and, for sufficiently large slices of Pi, the quicksort algorithm in Perl 5.8 won't return the same results even if reinvoked with the same input.  The justification for this rests with quicksort's worst case behavior.  If you run<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } ( 1 .. $N , 1 .. $N );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(something you might approximate if you wanted to merge two sorted arrays using sort), doubling $N doesn't just double the quicksort time, it  <i>quadruples</i> it.  Quicksort has a worst case run time that can grow like N**2, so-called  <i>quadratic</i> behaviour, and it can happen on patterns that may well arise in normal use.  You won't notice this for small arrays, but you  <i>will</i> notice it with larger arrays, and you may not live long enough for the sort to complete on arrays of a million elements.  So the 5.8 quicksort scrambles large arrays before sorting them, as a statistical defence against quadratic behaviour. But that means if you sort the same large array twice, ties may be broken in different ways.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Because of the unpredictability of tie-breaking order, and the quadratic worst-case behaviour, quicksort was  <i>almost</i> replaced completely with a stable mergesort.   <i>Stable</i> means that ties are broken to preserve the original order of appearance in the input array.  So<div style="height: 1.00em;">

will yield (4,3,1,1,5,9), guaranteed.  The even and odd numbers appear in the output in the same order they appeared in the input. Mergesort has worst case O(N log N) behaviour, the best value attainable.  And, ironically, this mergesort does particularly well where quicksort goes quadratic:  mergesort sorts (1..$N, 1..$N) in O(N) time.  But quicksort was rescued at the last moment because it is faster than mergesort on certain inputs and platforms. For example, if you really  <i>don't</i> care about the order of even and odd digits, quicksort will run in O(N) time; it's very good at sorting many repetitions of a small number of distinct elements. The quicksort divide and conquer strategy works well on platforms with relatively small, very fast, caches.  Eventually, the problem gets whittled down to one that fits in the cache, from which point it benefits from the increased memory speed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Quicksort was rescued by implementing a sort pragma to control aspects of the sort.  The  <b>stable</b> subpragma forces stable behaviour, regardless of algorithm.  The  <b>_quicksort</b> and <b>_mergesort</b> subpragmas are heavy-handed ways to select the underlying implementation. The leading &quot;_&quot; is a reminder that these subpragmas may not survive beyond 5.8.  More appropriate mechanisms for selecting the implementation exist, but they wouldn't have arrived in time to save quicksort.</dd>

Hashes now use Bob Jenkins &quot;One-at-a-Time&quot; hashing key algorithm ( http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html ).  This algorithm is reasonably fast while producing a much better spread of values than the old hashing algorithm (originally by Chris Torek, later tweaked by Ilya Zakharevich).  Hash values output from the algorithm on a hash of all 3-char printable ASCII keys comes much closer to passing the DIEHARD random number generation tests.  According to perlbench, this change has not affected the overall speed of Perl.</dd>

<h1>Installation and Configuration Improvements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Generic Improvements</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
INSTALL now explains how you can configure Perl to use 64-bit integers even on non-64-bit platforms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Policy.sh policy change: if you are reusing a Policy.sh file (see INSTALL) and you use Configure -Dprefix=/foo/bar and in the old Policy $prefix eq $siteprefix and $prefix eq $vendorprefix, all of them will now be changed to the new prefix, /foo/bar.  (Previously only $prefix changed.)  If you do not like this new behaviour, specify prefix, siteprefix, and vendorprefix explicitly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A new optional location for Perl libraries, otherlibdirs, is available. It can be used for example for vendor add-ons without disturbing Perl's own library directories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In many platforms, the vendor-supplied 'cc' is too stripped-down to build Perl (basically, 'cc' doesn't do ANSI C).  If this seems to be the case and 'cc' does not seem to be the GNU C compiler 'gcc', an automatic attempt is made to find and use 'gcc' instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
gcc needs to closely track the operating system release to avoid build problems. If Configure finds that gcc was built for a different operating system release than is running, it now gives a clearly visible warning that there may be trouble ahead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Since Perl 5.8 is not binary-compatible with previous releases of Perl, Configure no longer suggests including the 5.005 modules in @INC.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Configure &quot;-S&quot; can now run non-interactively. [561]</dd>

<dd>
Configure support for pdp11-style memory models has been removed due to obsolescence. [561]</dd>

<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
configure.gnu now works with options with whitespace in them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
installperl now outputs everything to STDERR.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Because PerlIO is now the default on most platforms, &quot;-perlio&quot; doesn't get appended to the $Config{archname} (also known as $^O) anymore. Instead, if you explicitly choose not to use perlio (Configure command line option -Uuseperlio), you will get &quot;-stdio&quot; appended.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Another change related to the architecture name is that &quot;-64all&quot; (-Duse64bitall, or &quot;maximally 64-bit&quot;) is appended only if your pointers are 64 bits wide.  (To be exact, the use64bitall is ignored.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In AFS installations, one can configure the root of the AFS to be somewhere else than the default  <i>/afs</i> by using the Configure parameter &quot;-Dafsroot=/some/where/else&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
APPLLIB_EXP, a lesser-known configuration-time definition, has been documented.  It can be used to prepend site-specific directories to Perl's default search path (@INC); see INSTALL for information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The version of Berkeley DB used when the Perl (and, presumably, the DB_File extension) was built is now available as @Config{qw(db_version_major db_version_minor db_version_patch)} from Perl and as &quot;DB_VERSION_MAJOR_CFG DB_VERSION_MINOR_CFG DB_VERSION_PATCH_CFG&quot; from C.</dd>
</dl>

&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Building Berkeley DB3 for compatibility modes for DB, NDBM, and ODBM has been documented in INSTALL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
If you have CPAN access (either network or a local copy such as a CD-ROM) you can during specify extra modules to Configure to build and install with Perl using the -Dextras=...  option.  See INSTALL for more details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In addition to config.over, a new override file, config.arch, is available.  This file is supposed to be used by hints file writers for architecture-wide changes (as opposed to config.over which is for site-wide changes).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
If your file system supports symbolic links, you can build Perl outside of the source directory by<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        mkdir perl/build/directory<br/>
        cd perl/build/directory<br/>
        sh /path/to/perl/source/Configure -Dmksymlinks ...<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This will create in perl/build/directory a tree of symbolic links pointing to files in /path/to/perl/source.  The original files are left unaffected.  After Configure has finished, you can just say<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        make all test<br/>

The behaviour of non-decimal but numeric string constants such as &quot;0x23&quot; was platform-dependent: in some platforms that was seen as 35, in some as 0, in some as a floating point number (don't ask).

Multi-line matches like &quot;&quot;a\nxb\n&quot; =~ /(?!\A)x/m&quot; were flawed.  The bug has been fixed. [561]</dd>

Use of $&amp; could trigger a core dump under some situations.  This is now avoided. [561]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

The regular expression captured submatches ($1, $2, ...) are now more consistently unset if the match fails, instead of leaving false data lying around in them. [561]</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>

<dd>
Tru64 (aka Digital UNIX, aka DEC OSF/1)<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The operating system version letter now recorded in $Config{osvers}. Allow compiling with gcc (previously explicitly forbidden).  Compiling with gcc still not recommended because buggy code results, even with gcc 2.95.2.</dd>

VMS<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;Socket Extension Dynamic in VMS&quot; and &quot;IEEE-format Floating Point Default on OpenVMS Alpha&quot; for important changes not otherwise listed here.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>chdir()</i> now works better despite a CRT bug; now works with MULTIPLICITY (see INSTALL); now works with Perl's malloc.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The tainting of %ENV elements via &quot;keys&quot; or &quot;values&quot; was previously unimplemented.  It now works as documented.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The &quot;waitpid&quot; emulation has been improved.  The worst bug (now fixed) was that a pid of -1 would cause a wildcard search of all processes on the system.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
POSIX-style signals are now emulated much better on VMS versions prior to 7.0.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The &quot;system&quot; function and backticks operator have improved functionality and better error handling. [561]<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
File access tests now use current process privileges rather than the user's default privileges, which could sometimes result in a mismatch between reported access and actual access.  This improvement is only available on VMS v6.0 and later.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There is a new &quot;kill&quot; implementation based on &quot;sys$sigprc&quot; that allows older VMS systems (pre-7.0) to use &quot;kill&quot; to send signals rather than simply force exit.  This implementation also allows later systems to call &quot;kill&quot; from within a signal handler.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Iterative logical name translations are now limited to 10 iterations in imitation of SHOW LOGICAL and other OpenVMS facilities.</dd>

<i>fork()</i> emulation is now more robust, but still continues to have a few esoteric bugs and caveats.  See perlfork for details. [561+]</dd>

The <i>Win32::SetChildShowWindow()</i> builtin can be used to control the visibility of windows created by child processes.  See Win32 for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Non-blocking waits for child processes (or pseudo-processes) are supported via &quot;waitpid($pid, &amp;POSIX::WNOHANG)&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The behavior of <i>system()</i> with multiple arguments has been rationalized. Each unquoted argument will be automatically quoted to protect whitespace, and any existing whitespace in the arguments will be preserved.  This improves the portability of system(@args) by avoiding the need for Windows &quot;cmd&quot; shell specific quoting in perl programs.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that this means that some scripts that may have relied on earlier buggy behavior may no longer work correctly.  For example, &quot;system(&quot;nmake /nologo&quot;, @args)&quot; will now attempt to run the file &quot;nmake /nologo&quot; and will fail when such a file isn't found. On the other hand, perl will now execute code such as &quot;system(&quot;c:/Program Files/MyApp/foo.exe&quot;, @args)&quot; correctly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>

The perl header files no longer suppress common warnings from the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.  This means that additional warnings may now show up when compiling XS code.</dd>

<div class="section">
<h1>Security Vulnerability Closed [561]</h1> (This change was already made in 5.7.0 but bears repeating here.) (5.7.0 came out before 5.6.1: the development branch 5.7 released earlier than the maintenance branch 5.6)<div class="spacer">
</div>
A potential security vulnerability in the optional suidperl component of Perl was identified in August 2000.  suidperl is neither built nor installed by default.  As of November 2001 the only known vulnerable platform is Linux, most likely all Linux distributions.  CERT and various vendors and distributors have been alerted about the vulnerability. See http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/sperl-2000-08-05.txt for more information.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The problem was caused by Perl trying to report a suspected security exploit attempt using an external program, /bin/mail.  On Linux platforms the /bin/mail program had an undocumented feature which when combined with suidperl gave access to a root shell, resulting in a serious compromise instead of reporting the exploit attempt.  If you don't have /bin/mail, or if you have 'safe setuid scripts', or if suidperl is not installed, you are safe.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The exploit attempt reporting feature has been completely removed from Perl 5.8.0 (and the maintenance release 5.6.1, and it was removed also from all the Perl 5.7 releases), so that particular vulnerability isn't there anymore.  However, further security vulnerabilities are, unfortunately, always possible.  The suidperl functionality is most probably going to be removed in Perl 5.10.  In any case, suidperl should only be used by security experts who know exactly what they are doing and why they are using suidperl instead of some other solution such as sudo ( see http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ ).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>New Tests</h1> Several new tests have been added, especially for the  <i>lib</i> and  <i>ext</i> subsections.  There are now about 69 000 individual tests (spread over about 700 test scripts), in the regression suite (5.6.1 has about 11 700 tests, in 258 test scripts)  The exact numbers depend on the platform and Perl configuration used.  Many of the new tests are of course introduced by the new modules, but still in general Perl is now more thoroughly tested.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Because of the large number of tests, running the regression suite will take considerably longer time than it used to: expect the suite to take up to 4-5 times longer to run than in perl 5.6.  On a really fast machine you can hope to finish the suite in about 6-8 minutes (wallclock time).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The tests are now reported in a different order than in earlier Perls. (This happens because the test scripts from under t/lib have been moved to be closer to the library/extension they are testing.)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Known Problems</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>The Compiler Suite Is Still Very Experimental</h2> The compiler suite is slowly getting better but it continues to be highly experimental.  Use in production environments is discouraged.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Localising Tied Arrays and Hashes Is Broken</h2><br/>
    local %tied_array;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
doesn't work as one would expect: the old value is restored incorrectly.  This will be changed in a future release, but we don't know yet what the new semantics will exactly be.  In any case, the change will break existing code that relies on the current (ill-defined) semantics, so just avoid doing this in general.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles</h2> Some extensions like mod_perl are known to have issues with `largefiles', a change brought by Perl 5.6.0 in which file offsets default to 64 bits wide, where supported.  Modules may fail to compile at all, or they may compile and work incorrectly.  Currently, there is no good solution for the problem, but Configure now provides appropriate non-largefile ccflags, ldflags, libswanted, and libs in the %Config hash (e.g., $Config{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the extensions that are having problems can try configuring themselves without the largefileness.  This is admittedly not a clean solution, and the solution may not even work at all.  One potential failure is whether one can (or, if one can, whether it's a good idea to) link together at all binaries with different ideas about file offsets; all this is platform-dependent.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Modifying $_ Inside for(..)</h2><br/>
   for (1..5) { $_++ }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
works without complaint.  It shouldn't.  (You should be able to modify only lvalue elements inside the loops.)  You can see the correct behaviour by replacing the 1..5 with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</div>

<h2>Perl_get_sv</h2> You may get errors like 'Undefined symbol &quot;Perl_get_sv&quot;' or &quot;can't resolve symbol 'Perl_get_sv'&quot;, or the symbol may be &quot;Perl_sv_2pv&quot;. This probably means that you are trying to use an older shared Perl library (or extensions linked with such) with Perl 5.8.0 executable. Perl used to have such a subroutine, but that is no more the case. Check your shared library path, and any shared Perl libraries in those directories.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Sometimes this problem may also indicate a partial Perl 5.8.0 installation, see &quot;Mac OS X dyld undefined symbols&quot; for an example and how to deal with it.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Self-tying Problems</h2> Self-tying of arrays and hashes is broken in rather deep and hard-to-fix ways.  As a stop-gap measure to avoid people from getting frustrated at the mysterious results (core dumps, most often), it is forbidden for now (you will get a fatal error even from an attempt).<div class="spacer">
</div>
A change to self-tying of globs has caused them to be recursively referenced (see: &quot;Two-Phased Garbage Collection&quot; in perlobj).  You will now need an explicit untie to destroy a self-tied glob.  This behaviour may be fixed at a later date.<div class="spacer">

<h2>ext/threads/t/libc</h2> If this test fails, it indicates that your libc (C library) is not threadsafe.  This particular test stress tests the  <i>localtime()</i> call to find out whether it is threadsafe.  See perlthrtut for more information.</div>

In AIX 4.2, Perl extensions that use C++ functions that use statics may have problems in that the statics are not getting initialized. In newer AIX releases, this has been solved by linking Perl with the libC_r library, but unfortunately in AIX 4.2 the said library has an obscure bug where the various functions related to time (such as  <i>time()</i> and <i>gettimeofday()</i>) return broken values, and therefore in AIX 4.2 Perl is not linked against libC_r.</dd>

The op/pack failure (&quot;Cannot compress negative numbers at op/pack.t line 126&quot;) is serious but as of yet unsolved.  It points at some problems with the signedness handling of the C compiler, as do the 64bitint, arith, and pow failures.  Most of the rest point at problems with SysV IPC.</div>

This is caused by a bug in the awk utility of UNICOS/mk.  You can ignore the error, but it does cause a slight problem: you cannot fully benefit from the h2ph utility (see h2ph) that can be used to convert C headers to Perl libraries, mainly used to be able to access from Perl the constants defined using C preprocessor, cpp.  Because of the above error, parts of the converted headers will be invisible. Luckily, these days the need for h2ph is rare.</dd>

If building Perl with interpreter threads (ithreads), the  <i>getgrent()</i>, <i>getgrnam()</i>, and <i>getgrgid()</i> functions cannot return the list of the group members due to a bug in the multithreaded support of UNICOS/mk.  What this means is that in list context the functions will return only three values, not four.</dd>

The failures in dumper.t and downgrade.t are problems in the tests, those in io_unix and sprintf are problems in the USS (UDP sockets and printf formats).  The pat, tr, and fold failures are genuine Perl problems caused by EBCDIC (and in the pat and fold cases, combining that with Unicode).  The Constant and Embed are probably problems in the tests (since they test Perl's ability to build extensions, and that seems to be working reasonably well.)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode Support on EBCDIC Still Spotty</h2> Though mostly working, Unicode support still has problem spots on EBCDIC platforms.  One such known spot are the &quot;\p{}&quot; and &quot;\P{}&quot; regular expression constructs for code points less than 256: the &quot;pP&quot; are testing for Unicode code points, not knowing about EBCDIC.</div>

<h2>Seen In Perl 5.7 But Gone Now</h2> &quot;Time::Piece&quot; (previously known as &quot;Time::Object&quot;) was removed because it was felt that it didn't have enough value in it to be a core module.  It is still a useful module, though, and is available from the CPAN.<div class="spacer">

Perl 5.8 unfortunately does not build anymore on AmigaOS; this broke accidentally at some point.  Since there are not that many Amiga developers available, we could not get this fixed and tested in time for 5.8.0.  Perl 5.6.1 still works for AmigaOS (as does the 5.7.2 development release).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;PerlIO::Scalar&quot; and &quot;PerlIO::Via&quot; (capitalised) were renamed as &quot;PerlIO::scalar&quot; and &quot;PerlIO::via&quot; (all lowercase) just before 5.8.0. The main rationale was to have all core PerlIO layers to have all lowercase names.  The &quot;plugins&quot; are named as usual, for example &quot;PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;threads::shared::queue&quot; and &quot;threads::shared::semaphore&quot; were renamed as &quot;Thread::Queue&quot; and &quot;Thread::Semaphore&quot; just before 5.8.0. The main rationale was to have thread modules to obey normal naming, &quot;Thread::&quot; (the &quot;threads&quot; and &quot;threads::shared&quot; themselves are more pragma-like, they affect compile-time, so they stay lowercase).</div>
