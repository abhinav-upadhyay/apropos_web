<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This section deals with questions related to networking, the internet, and a few on the web.<div class="subsection">
<h2>What is the correct form of response from a CGI script?</h2> (Alan Flavell &lt;flavell+www@a5.ph.gla.ac.uk&gt; answers...)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) specifies a software interface between a program (&quot;CGI script&quot;) and a web server (HTTPD). It is not specific to Perl, and has its own FAQs and tutorials, and usenet group, comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi<div class="spacer">
</div>
The CGI specification is outlined in an informational RFC: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3875<div class="spacer">
</div>
These Perl FAQs very selectively cover some CGI issues. However, Perl programmers are strongly advised to use the &quot;CGI.pm&quot; module, to take care of the details for them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The similarity between CGI response headers (defined in the CGI specification) and HTTP response headers (defined in the HTTP specification, RFC2616) is intentional, but can sometimes be confusing.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The CGI specification defines two kinds of script: the &quot;Parsed Header&quot; script, and the &quot;Non Parsed Header&quot; (NPH) script. Check your server documentation to see what it supports. &quot;Parsed Header&quot; scripts are simpler in various respects. The CGI specification allows any of the usual newline representations in the CGI response (it's the server's job to create an accurate HTTP response based on it). So &quot;\n&quot; written in text mode is technically correct, and recommended. NPH scripts are more tricky: they must put out a complete and accurate set of HTTP transaction response headers; the HTTP specification calls for records to be terminated with carriage-return and line-feed; i.e., ASCII \015\012 written in binary mode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Using &quot;CGI.pm&quot; gives excellent platform independence, including EBCDIC systems. &quot;CGI.pm&quot; selects an appropriate newline representation ($CGI::CRLF) and sets binmode as appropriate.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>My CGI script runs from the command line but not the browser. (500 Server Error)</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are many things that might be wrong with your CGI program, and only some of them might be related to Perl. Try going through the troubleshooting guide on Perlmonks:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=380424<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How can I get better error messages from a CGI program?</h2> Use the &quot;CGI::Carp&quot; module.  It replaces &quot;warn&quot; and &quot;die&quot;, plus the normal &quot;Carp&quot; module's &quot;carp&quot;, &quot;croak&quot;, and &quot;confess&quot; functions with more verbose and safer versions.  It still sends them to the normal server error log.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use CGI::Carp;<br/>
        warn &quot;This is a complaint&quot;;<br/>
        die &quot;But this one is serious&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following use of &quot;CGI::Carp&quot; also redirects errors to a file of your choice, placed in a &quot;BEGIN&quot; block to catch compile-time warnings as well:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        BEGIN {<br/>
                use CGI::Carp qw(carpout);<br/>
                open(LOG, &quot;&gt;&gt;/var/local/cgi-logs/mycgi-log&quot;)<br/>
                        or die &quot;Unable to append to mycgi-log: $!\n&quot;;<br/>
                carpout(*LOG);<br/>
        }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can even arrange for fatal errors to go back to the client browser, which is nice for your own debugging, but might confuse the end user.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);<br/>
        die &quot;Bad error here&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Even if the error happens before you get the HTTP header out, the module will try to take care of this to avoid the dreaded server 500 errors. Normal warnings still go out to the server error log (or wherever you've sent them with &quot;carpout&quot;) with the application name and date stamp prepended.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I remove HTML from a string?</h2> The most correct way (albeit not the fastest) is to use &quot;HTML::Parser&quot; from CPAN.  Another mostly correct way is to use &quot;HTML::FormatText&quot; which not only removes HTML but also attempts to do a little simple formatting of the resulting plain text.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Many folks attempt a simple-minded regular expression approach, like &quot;s/&lt;.*?&gt;//g&quot;, but that fails in many cases because the tags may continue over line breaks, they may contain quoted angle-brackets, or HTML comments may be present.  Plus, folks forget to convert entities--like &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; for example.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here's one &quot;simple-minded&quot; approach, that works for most files:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        #!/usr/bin/perl -p0777<br/>
        s/&lt;(?:[^&gt;'&quot;]*|(['&quot;]).*?\g1)*&gt;//gs<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want a more complete solution, see the 3-stage striphtml program in http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/striphtml.gz .<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here are some tricky cases that you should think about when picking a solution:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        &lt;IMG SRC = &quot;foo.gif&quot; ALT = &quot;A &gt; B&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
        &lt;IMG SRC = &quot;foo.gif&quot;<br/>
         ALT = &quot;A &gt; B&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
        &lt;!-- &lt;A comment&gt; --&gt;<br/>
<br/>
        &lt;script&gt;if (a&lt;b &amp;&amp; a&gt;c)&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
        &lt;# Just data #&gt;<br/>
<br/>
        &lt;![INCLUDE CDATA [ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ]]&gt;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If HTML comments include other tags, those solutions would also break on text like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        &lt;!-- This section commented out.<br/>
                &lt;B&gt;You can't see me!&lt;/B&gt;<br/>
        --&gt;<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I extract URLs?</h2> You can easily extract all sorts of URLs from HTML with &quot;HTML::SimpleLinkExtor&quot; which handles anchors, images, objects, frames, and many other tags that can contain a URL.  If you need anything more complex, you can create your own subclass of &quot;HTML::LinkExtor&quot; or &quot;HTML::Parser&quot;.  You might even use &quot;HTML::SimpleLinkExtor&quot; as an example for something specifically suited to your needs.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can use &quot;URI::Find&quot; to extract URLs from an arbitrary text document.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Less complete solutions involving regular expressions can save you a lot of processing time if you know that the input is simple.  One solution from Tom Christiansen runs 100 times faster than most module-based approaches but only extracts URLs from anchors where the first attribute is HREF and there are no other attributes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        #!/usr/bin/perl -n00<br/>
        # qxurl - tchrist@perl.com<br/>
        print &quot;$2\n&quot; while m{<br/>
                &lt; \s*<br/>
                  A \s+ HREF \s* = \s* ([&quot;']) (.*?) \g1<br/>
                \s* &gt;<br/>
        }gsix;<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I download a file from the user's machine?  How do I open a file on another machine?</h2> In this case, download means to use the file upload feature of HTML forms.  You allow the web surfer to specify a file to send to your web server.  To you it looks like a download, and to the user it looks like an upload.  No matter what you call it, you do it with what's known as  <b>multipart/form-data</b> encoding.  The &quot;CGI.pm&quot; module (which comes with Perl as part of the Standard Library) supports this in the &quot;start_multipart_form()&quot; method, which isn't the same as the &quot;startform()&quot; method.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the section in the &quot;CGI.pm&quot; documentation on file uploads for code examples and details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I make an HTML pop-up menu with Perl?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;CGI.pm&quot; module (which comes with Perl) has functions to create the HTML form widgets. See the &quot;CGI.pm&quot; documentation for more examples.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use CGI qw/:standard/;<br/>
        print header,<br/>
                start_html('Favorite Animals'),<br/>
<br/>
                start_form,<br/>
                        &quot;What's your favorite animal? &quot;,<br/>
                popup_menu(<br/>
                        -name   =&gt; 'animal',<br/>
                        -values =&gt; [ qw( Llama Alpaca Camel Ram ) ]<br/>
                        ),<br/>
                submit,<br/>
<br/>
                end_form,<br/>
                end_html;<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I fetch an HTML file?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Use the libwww-perl distribution. The &quot;LWP::Simple&quot; module can fetch web resources and give their content back to you as a string:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use LWP::Simple qw(get);<br/>
<br/>
        my $html = get( &quot;http://www.example.com/index.html&quot; );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It can also store the resource directly in a file:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use LWP::Simple qw(getstore);<br/>
<br/>
        getstore( &quot;http://www.example.com/index.html&quot;, &quot;foo.html&quot; );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you need to do something more complicated, you can use &quot;LWP::UserAgent&quot; module to create your own user-agent (e.g. browser) to get the job done. If you want to simulate an interactive web browser, you can use the &quot;WWW::Mechanize&quot; module.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I automate an HTML form submission?</h2> If you are doing something complex, such as moving through many pages and forms or a web site, you can use &quot;WWW::Mechanize&quot;.  See its documentation for all the details.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you're submitting values using the GET method, create a URL and encode the form using the &quot;query_form&quot; method:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use LWP::Simple;<br/>
        use URI::URL;<br/>
<br/>
        my $url = url('http://www.perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod');<br/>
        $url-&gt;query_form(module =&gt; 'DB_File', readme =&gt; 1);<br/>
        $content = get($url);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you're using the POST method, create your own user agent and encode the content appropriately.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use HTTP::Request::Common qw(POST);<br/>
        use LWP::UserAgent;<br/>
<br/>
        $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new();<br/>
        my $req = POST 'http://www.perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod',<br/>
                                   [ module =&gt; 'DB_File', readme =&gt; 1 ];<br/>
        $content = $ua-&gt;request($req)-&gt;as_string;<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I decode or create those %-encodings on the web?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Those &quot;%&quot; encodings handle reserved characters in URIs, as described in RFC 2396, Section 2. This encoding replaces the reserved character with the hexadecimal representation of the character's number from the US-ASCII table. For instance, a colon, &quot;:&quot;, becomes %3A.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In CGI scripts, you don't have to worry about decoding URIs if you are using &quot;CGI.pm&quot;. You shouldn't have to process the URI yourself, either on the way in or the way out.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you have to encode a string yourself, remember that you should never try to encode an already-composed URI. You need to escape the components separately then put them together. To encode a string, you can use the &quot;URI::Escape&quot; module. The &quot;uri_escape&quot; function returns the escaped string:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        my $original = &quot;Colon : Hash # Percent %&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
        my $escaped = uri_escape( $original );<br/>
<br/>
        print &quot;$escaped\n&quot;; # 'Colon%20%3A%20Hash%20%23%20Percent%20%25'<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To decode the string, use the &quot;uri_unescape&quot; function:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        my $unescaped = uri_unescape( $escaped );<br/>
<br/>
        print $unescaped; # back to original<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you wanted to do it yourself, you simply need to replace the reserved characters with their encodings. A global substitution is one way to do it:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        # encode<br/>
        $string =~ s/([^^A-Za-z0-9\-_.!~*'()])/ sprintf &quot;%%%0x&quot;, ord $1 /eg;<br/>
<br/>
        #decode<br/>
        $string =~ s/%([A-Fa-f\d]{2})/chr hex $1/eg;<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I redirect to another page?</h2> Specify the complete URL of the destination (even if it is on the same server). This is one of the two different kinds of CGI &quot;Location:&quot; responses which are defined in the CGI specification for a Parsed Headers script. The other kind (an absolute URLpath) is resolved internally to the server without any HTTP redirection. The CGI specifications do not allow relative URLs in either case.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Use of &quot;CGI.pm&quot; is strongly recommended.  This example shows redirection with a complete URL. This redirection is handled by the web browser.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use CGI qw/:standard/;<br/>
<br/>
        my $url = 'http://www.cpan.org/';<br/>
        print redirect($url);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This example shows a redirection with an absolute URLpath.  This redirection is handled by the local web server.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        my $url = '/CPAN/index.html';<br/>
        print redirect($url);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
But if coded directly, it could be as follows (the final &quot;\n&quot; is shown separately, for clarity), using either a complete URL or an absolute URLpath.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        print &quot;Location: $url\n&quot;;   # CGI response header<br/>
        print &quot;\n&quot;;                 # end of headers<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I put a password on my web pages?</h2> To enable authentication for your web server, you need to configure your web server.  The configuration is different for different sorts of web servers--apache does it differently from iPlanet which does it differently from IIS.  Check your web server documentation for the details for your particular server.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I edit my .htpasswd and .htgroup files with Perl?</h2> The &quot;HTTPD::UserAdmin&quot; and &quot;HTTPD::GroupAdmin&quot; modules provide a consistent OO interface to these files, regardless of how they're stored.  Databases may be text, dbm, Berkeley DB or any database with a DBI compatible driver.  &quot;HTTPD::UserAdmin&quot; supports files used by the &quot;Basic&quot; and &quot;Digest&quot; authentication schemes.  Here's an example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use HTTPD::UserAdmin ();<br/>
        HTTPD::UserAdmin<br/>
          -&gt;new(DB =&gt; &quot;/foo/.htpasswd&quot;)<br/>
          -&gt;add($username =&gt; $password);<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I make sure users can't enter values into a form that cause my CGI script to do bad things?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can't prevent people from sending your script bad data. Even if you add some client-side checks, people may disable them or bypass them completely. For instance, someone might use a module such as &quot;LWP&quot; to access your CGI program. If you want to prevent data that try to use SQL injection or other sorts of attacks (and you should want to), you have to not trust any data that enter your program.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The perlsec documentation has general advice about data security. If you are using the &quot;DBI&quot; module, use placeholder to fill in data. If you are running external programs with &quot;system&quot; or &quot;exec&quot;, use the list forms. There are many other precautions that you should take, too many to list here, and most of them fall under the category of not using any data that you don't intend to use. Trust no one.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I parse a mail header?</h2> For a quick-and-dirty solution, try this solution derived from &quot;split&quot; in perlfunc:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $/ = '';<br/>
        $header = &lt;MSG&gt;;<br/>
        $header =~ s/\n\s+/ /g;  # merge continuation lines<br/>
        %head = ( UNIX_FROM_LINE, split /^([-\w]+):\s*/m, $header );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
That solution doesn't do well if, for example, you're trying to maintain all the Received lines.  A more complete approach is to use the &quot;Mail::Header&quot; module from CPAN (part of the &quot;MailTools&quot; package).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I decode a CGI form?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Use the &quot;CGI.pm&quot; module that comes with Perl.  It's quick, it's easy, and it actually does quite a bit of work to ensure things happen correctly.  It handles GET, POST, and HEAD requests, multipart forms, multivalued fields, query string and message body combinations, and many other things you probably don't want to think about.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It doesn't get much easier: the &quot;CGI.pm&quot; module automatically parses the input and makes each value available through the &quot;param()&quot; function.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use CGI qw(:standard);<br/>
<br/>
        my $total = param( 'price' ) + param( 'shipping' );<br/>
<br/>
        my @items = param( 'item' ); # multiple values, same field name<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want an object-oriented approach, &quot;CGI.pm&quot; can do that too.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use CGI;<br/>
<br/>
        my $cgi = CGI-&gt;new();<br/>
<br/>
        my $total = $cgi-&gt;param( 'price' ) + $cgi-&gt;param( 'shipping' );<br/>
<br/>
        my @items = $cgi-&gt;param( 'item' );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You might also try &quot;CGI::Minimal&quot; which is a lightweight version of the same thing.  Other CGI::* modules on CPAN might work better for you, too.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Many people try to write their own decoder (or copy one from another program) and then run into one of the many &quot;gotchas&quot; of the task.  It's much easier and less hassle to use &quot;CGI.pm&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I check a valid mail address?</h2> (partly contributed by Aaron Sherman)<div class="spacer">
</div>
This isn't as simple a question as it sounds.  There are two parts:<div class="spacer">
</div>
a) How do I verify that an email address is correctly formatted?<div class="spacer">
</div>
b) How do I verify that an email address targets a valid recipient?<div class="spacer">
</div>
Without sending mail to the address and seeing whether there's a human on the other end to answer you, you cannot fully answer part  <i>b</i>, but either the &quot;Email::Valid&quot; or the &quot;RFC::RFC822::Address&quot; module will do both part  <i>a</i> and part <i>b</i> as far as you can in real-time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to just check part <i>a</i> to see that the address is valid according to the mail header standard with a simple regular expression, you can have problems, because there are deliverable addresses that aren't RFC-2822 (the latest mail header standard) compliant, and addresses that aren't deliverable which, are compliant.  However,  the following will match valid RFC-2822 addresses that do not have comments, folding whitespace, or any other obsolete or non-essential elements. This  <i>just</i> matches the address itself:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        my $atom       = qr{[a-zA-Z0-9_!#\$\%&amp;'*+/=?\^`{}~|\-]+};<br/>
        my $dot_atom   = qr{$atom(?:\.$atom)*};<br/>
        my $quoted     = qr{&quot;(?:\\[^\r\n]|[^\\&quot;])*&quot;};<br/>
        my $local      = qr{(?:$dot_atom|$quoted)};<br/>
        my $quotedpair = qr{\\[\x00-\x09\x0B-\x0c\x0e-\x7e]};<br/>
        my $domain_lit = qr{\[(?:$quotedpair|[\x21-\x5a\x5e-\x7e])*\]};<br/>
        my $domain     = qr{(?:$dot_atom|$domain_lit)};<br/>
        my $addr_spec  = qr{$local\@$domain};<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Just match an address against &quot;/^${addr_spec}$/&quot; to see if it follows the RFC2822 specification.  However, because it is impossible to be sure that such a correctly formed address is actually the correct way to reach a particular person or even has a mailbox associated with it, you must be very careful about how you use this.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Our best advice for verifying a person's mail address is to have them enter their address twice, just as you normally do to change a password. This usually weeds out typos. If both versions match, send mail to that address with a personal message. If you get the message back and they've followed your directions, you can be reasonably assured that it's real.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A related strategy that's less open to forgery is to give them a PIN (personal ID number).  Record the address and PIN (best that it be a random one) for later processing. In the mail you send, ask them to include the PIN in their reply.  But if it bounces, or the message is included via a &quot;vacation&quot; script, it'll be there anyway.  So it's best to ask them to mail back a slight alteration of the PIN, such as with the characters reversed, one added or subtracted to each digit, etc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I decode a MIME/BASE64 string?</h2> The &quot;MIME-Base64&quot; package (available from CPAN) handles this as well as the MIME/QP encoding.  Decoding BASE64 becomes as simple as:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use MIME::Base64;<br/>
        $decoded = decode_base64($encoded);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;MIME-Tools&quot; package (available from CPAN) supports extraction with decoding of BASE64 encoded attachments and content directly from email messages.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the string to decode is short (less than 84 bytes long) a more direct approach is to use the &quot;unpack()&quot; function's &quot;u&quot; format after minor transliterations:<div class="spacer">

<h2>How do I return the user's mail address?</h2> On systems that support getpwuid, the $&lt; variable, and the &quot;Sys::Hostname&quot; module (which is part of the standard perl distribution), you can probably try using something like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Sys::Hostname;<br/>
        $address = sprintf('%s@%s', scalar getpwuid($&lt;), hostname);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Company policies on mail address can mean that this generates addresses that the company's mail system will not accept, so you should ask for users' mail addresses when this matters.  Furthermore, not all systems on which Perl runs are so forthcoming with this information as is Unix.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;Mail::Util&quot; module from CPAN (part of the &quot;MailTools&quot; package) provides a &quot;mailaddress()&quot; function that tries to guess the mail address of the user. It makes a more intelligent guess than the code above, using information given when the module was installed, but it could still be incorrect. Again, the best way is often just to ask the user.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I send mail?</h2> Use the &quot;sendmail&quot; program directly:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        open(SENDMAIL, &quot;|/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -t -odq&quot;)<br/>
                or die &quot;Can't fork for sendmail: $!\n&quot;;<br/>
        print SENDMAIL &lt;&lt;&quot;EOF&quot;;<br/>
        From: User Originating Mail &lt;me\@host&gt;<br/>
        To: Final Destination &lt;you\@otherhost&gt;<br/>
        Subject: A relevant subject line<br/>
<br/>
        Body of the message goes here after the blank line<br/>
        in as many lines as you like.<br/>
        EOF<br/>
        close(SENDMAIL)     or warn &quot;sendmail didn't close nicely&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-oi</b> option prevents &quot;sendmail&quot; from interpreting a line consisting of a single dot as &quot;end of message&quot;.  The  <b>-t</b> option says to use the headers to decide who to send the message to, and  <b>-odq</b> says to put the message into the queue.  This last option means your message won't be immediately delivered, so leave it out if you want immediate delivery.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Alternate, less convenient approaches include calling &quot;mail&quot; (sometimes called &quot;mailx&quot;) directly or simply opening up port 25 have having an intimate conversation between just you and the remote SMTP daemon, probably &quot;sendmail&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Or you might be able use the CPAN module &quot;Mail::Mailer&quot;:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Mail::Mailer;<br/>
<br/>
        $mailer = Mail::Mailer-&gt;new();<br/>
        $mailer-&gt;open({ From    =&gt; $from_address,<br/>
                                        To      =&gt; $to_address,<br/>
                                        Subject =&gt; $subject,<br/>
                                  })<br/>
                or die &quot;Can't open: $!\n&quot;;<br/>
        print $mailer $body;<br/>
        $mailer-&gt;close();<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;Mail::Internet&quot; module uses &quot;Net::SMTP&quot; which is less Unix-centric than &quot;Mail::Mailer&quot;, but less reliable.  Avoid raw SMTP commands.  There are many reasons to use a mail transport agent like &quot;sendmail&quot;.  These include queuing, MX records, and security.</div>

<h2>How do I use MIME to make an attachment to a mail message?</h2> This answer is extracted directly from the &quot;MIME::Lite&quot; documentation. Create a multipart message (i.e., one with attachments).<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use MIME::Lite;<br/>
<br/>
        ### Create a new multipart message:<br/>
        $msg = MIME::Lite-&gt;new(<br/>
                                 From    =&gt;'me@myhost.com',<br/>

                                 );<br/>
<br/>
        ### Add parts (each &quot;attach&quot; has same arguments as &quot;new&quot;):<br/>
        $msg-&gt;attach(Type     =&gt;'TEXT',<br/>
                                 Data     =&gt;&quot;Here's the GIF file you wanted&quot;<br/>
                                 );<br/>
        $msg-&gt;attach(Type     =&gt;'image/gif',<br/>
                                 Path     =&gt;'aaa000123.gif',<br/>
                                 Filename =&gt;'logo.gif'<br/>
                                 );<br/>
<br/>
        $text = $msg-&gt;as_string;<br/>
<div class="spacer">

&quot;MIME::Lite&quot; also includes a method for sending these things.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $msg-&gt;send;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This defaults to using sendmail but can be customized to use SMTP via Net::SMTP.</div>

<h2>How do I read mail?</h2> While you could use the &quot;Mail::Folder&quot; module from CPAN (part of the &quot;MailFolder&quot; package) or the &quot;Mail::Internet&quot; module from CPAN (part of the &quot;MailTools&quot; package), often a module is overkill.  Here's a mail sorter.<div class="spacer">

<h2>How do I find out my hostname, domainname, or IP address?</h2> gethostbyname, Socket, Net::Domain, Sys::Hostname&quot; (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;Net::Domain&quot; module, which is part of the standard distribution starting in perl5.7.3, can get you the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), the host name, or the domain name.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Net::Domain qw(hostname hostfqdn hostdomain);<br/>
<br/>
        my $host = hostfqdn();<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;Sys::Hostname&quot; module, included in the standard distribution since perl5.6, can also get the hostname.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Sys::Hostname;<br/>
<br/>
        $host = hostname();<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To get the IP address, you can use the &quot;gethostbyname&quot; built-in function to turn the name into a number. To turn that number into the dotted octet form (a.b.c.d) that most people expect, use the &quot;inet_ntoa&quot; function from the &quot;Socket&quot; module, which also comes with perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Socket;<br/>
<br/>
        my $address = inet_ntoa(<br/>
                scalar gethostbyname( $host || 'localhost' )<br/>
                );<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I fetch a news article or the active newsgroups?</h2> Use the &quot;Net::NNTP&quot; or &quot;News::NNTPClient&quot; modules, both available from CPAN. This can make tasks like fetching the newsgroup list as simple as<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        perl -MNews::NNTPClient<br/>
          -e 'print News::NNTPClient-&gt;new-&gt;list(&quot;newsgroups&quot;)'<br/>

<h2>How do I fetch/put an FTP file?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;LWP&quot; family of modules (available on CPAN as the libwww-perl distribution) can work with FTP just like it can with many other protocols. &quot;LWP::Simple&quot; makes it quite easy to fetch a file:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use LWP::Simple;<br/>
<br/>
        my $data = get( 'ftp://some.ftp.site/some/file.txt' );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want more direct or low-level control of the FTP process, you can use the &quot;Net::FTP&quot; module (in the Standard Library since Perl 5.8). It's documentation has examples showing you just how to do that.</div>
