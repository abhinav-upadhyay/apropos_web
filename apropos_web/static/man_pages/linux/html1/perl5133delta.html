<h1>NAME</h1> perl5133delta - what is new for perl v5.13.3</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.13.3 release and the 5.13.2 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.13.1, first read perl5132delta, which describes differences between 5.13.1 and 5.13.2.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>\o{...} for octals</h2> There is a new escape sequence, &quot;\o&quot;, in double-quote-like contexts. It must be followed by braces enclosing an octal number of at least one digit.  It interpolates as the character with an ordinal value equal to the octal number.  This construct allows large octal ordinals beyond the current max of 0777 to be represented.  It also allows you to specify a character in octal which can safely be concatenated with other regex snippets and which won't be confused with being a backreference to a regex capture group.  See &quot;Capture groups&quot; in perlre.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;\N{<i>name</i>}&quot; and &quot;charnames&quot; enhancements</h2> &quot;\N{}&quot; and &quot;charnames::vianame&quot; now know about the abbreviated character names listed by Unicode, such as NBSP, SHY, LRO, ZWJ, etc., as well as all the customary abbreviations for the C0 and C1 control characters (such as ACK, BEL, CAN, etc.), as well as a few new variants in common usage of some C1 full names.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the past, it was ineffective to override one of Perl's abbreviations with your own custom alias.  Now it works.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can also create a custom alias directly to the ordinal of a character, known by &quot;\N{...}&quot;, &quot;charnames::vianame()&quot;, and &quot;charnames::viacode()&quot;.  Previously, an alias had to be to an official Unicode character name.  This made it impossible to create an alias for a code point that had no name, such as the ones reserved for private use.  So this change allows you to make more effective use of private use characters.  Only if there is no official name will &quot;charnames::viacode()&quot; return your custom one.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See charnames for details on all these changes.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Uppercase X/B allowed in hexadecimal/binary literals</h2> Literals may now use either upper case &quot;0X...&quot; or &quot;0B...&quot; prefixes, in addition to the already supported &quot;0x...&quot; and &quot;0b...&quot; syntax. (RT#76296) (a674e8d, 333f87f)<div class="spacer">
</div>
C, Ruby, Python and PHP already supported this syntax, and it makes Perl more internally consistent. A round-trip with &quot;eval sprintf &quot;%#X&quot;, 0x10&quot; now returns 16 in addition to &quot;eval sprintf &quot;%#x&quot;, 0x10&quot;, which worked before.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>\400 - \777</h2> Use of &quot;\400&quot; - &quot;\777&quot; in regexes in certain circumstances has given different, anomalous behavior than their use in all other double-quote-like contexts.   Since 5.10.1, a deprecated warning message has been raised when this happens.  Now, all double-quote-like contexts have the same behavior, namely to be equivalent to &quot;\x{100}&quot; - &quot;\x{1FF}&quot;, with no deprecation warning. Use of these values in the command line option &quot;-0&quot; retains the current meaning to slurp input files whole; previously, this was documented only for &quot;-0777&quot;.  It is recommended, however, because of various ambiguities, to use the new &quot;\o{...}&quot; construct to represent characters in octal. (fa1639c..f6993e9).</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Deprecations</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Omitting a space between a regular expression and subsequent word</h2> Omitting a space between a regex pattern or pattern modifiers and the following word is deprecated. Deprecation for regular expression  <i>matches</i> was added in Perl 5.13.2.  In this release, the deprecation is extended to regular expression  <i>substitutions</i>. For example, &quot;s/foo/bar/sand $bar&quot; will still be parsed as &quot;s/foo/bar/s and $bar&quot; but will issue a warning. (aa78b66)</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Deprecation warning added for deprecated-in-core .pl libs</h2> This is a mandatory warning, not obeying -X or lexical warning bits. The warning is modelled on that supplied by deprecate.pm for deprecated-in-core .pm libraries.  It points to the specific CPAN distribution that contains the .pl libraries. The CPAN version, of course, does not generate the warning. (0111154)</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Performance Enhancements</h1> There are several small optimizations to reduce CPU cache misses in various very commonly used modules like &quot;warnings&quot; and &quot;Carp&quot; as well in accessing file-handles for reading.</div>

<h1>Internal Changes</h1><dl>

Under some circumstances, the &quot;CvGV()&quot; field of a CV is now reference counted. To ensure consistent behaviour, direct assignment to it, for example &quot;CvGV(cv) = gv&quot; is now a compile-time error. A new macro, &quot;CvGV_set(cv,gv)&quot; has been introduced to perform this operation safely. Note that modification of this field is not part of of the public API, regardless of this new macro. This change caused some issues in modules that used the private &quot;GvGV()&quot; field.</dd>

<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</div>
