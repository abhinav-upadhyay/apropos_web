<h1>NAME</h1> README.hpux - Perl version 5 on Hewlett-Packard Unix (HP-UX) systems</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes various features of HP's Unix operating system (HP-UX) that will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Using perl as shipped with HP-UX</h2> Application release September 2001, HP-UX 11.00 is the first to ship with Perl. By the time it was perl-5.6.1 in /opt/perl. The first occurrence is on CD 5012-7954 and can be installed using<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  swinstall -s /cdrom perl<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
assuming you have mounted that CD on /cdrom. In this version the following modules were installed:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  ActivePerl::DocTools-0.04   HTML::Parser-3.19   XML::DOM-1.25<br/>
  Archive::Tar-0.072          HTML::Tagset-3.03   XML::Parser-2.27<br/>
  Compress::Zlib-1.08         MIME::Base64-2.11   XML::Simple-1.05<br/>
  Convert::ASN1-0.10          Net-1.07            XML::XPath-1.09<br/>
  Digest::MD5-2.11            PPM-2.1.5           XML::XSLT-0.32<br/>
  File::CounterFile-0.12      SOAP::Lite-0.46     libwww-perl-5.51<br/>
  Font::AFM-1.18              Storable-1.011      libxml-perl-0.07<br/>
  HTML-Tree-3.11              URI-1.11            perl-ldap-0.23<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
That build was a portable hppa-1.1 multithread build that supports large files compiled with gcc-2.9-hppa-991112.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you perform a new installation, then (a newer) Perl will be installed automatically.  Preinstalled HP-UX systems now slao have more recent versions of Perl and the updated modules.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The official (threaded) builds from HP, as they are shipped on the Application DVD/CD's are available on &lt;http://www.software.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayProductInfo.do?productNumber=PERL&gt; for both PA-RISC and IPF (Itanium Processor Family). They are built with the HP ANSI-C compiler. Up till 5.8.8 that was done by ActiveState.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To see what version is included on the DVD (assumed here to be mounted on /cdrom), issue this command:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  # swlist -s /cdrom perl<br/>
  # perl           D.5.8.8.B  5.8.8 Perl Programming Language<br/>
    perl.Perl5-32  D.5.8.8.B  32-bit 5.8.8 Perl Programming Language with Extensions<br/>
    perl.Perl5-64  D.5.8.8.B  64-bit 5.8.8 Perl Programming Language with Extensions<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Using perl from HP's porting centre</h2> HP porting centre tries very hard to keep up with customer demand and release updates from the Open Source community. Having precompiled Perl binaries available is obvious.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The HP porting centres are limited in what systems they are allowed to port to and they usually choose the two most recent OS versions available. This means that at the moment of writing, there are only HP-UX 11.11 (pa-risc 2.0) and HP-UX 11.23 (Itanium 2) ports available on the porting centres.<div class="spacer">
</div>
HP has asked the porting centre to move Open Source binaries from /opt to /usr/local, so binaries produced since the start of July 2002 are located in /usr/local.<div class="spacer">
</div>
One of HP porting centres URL's is &lt;http://hpux.connect.org.uk/&gt; The port currently available is built with GNU gcc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Compiling Perl 5 on HP-UX</h2> When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler.  The C compiler that ships with all HP-UX systems is a K&amp;R compiler that should only be used to build new kernels.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl can be compiled with either HP's ANSI C compiler or with gcc.  The former is recommended, as not only can it compile Perl with no difficulty, but also can take advantage of features listed later that require the use of HP compiler-specific command-line flags.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent and complete, and be sure to read the Perl INSTALL file for more gcc-specific details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>PA-RISC</h2> HP's HP9000 Unix systems run on HP's own Precision Architecture (PA-RISC) chip.  HP-UX used to run on the Motorola MC68000 family of chips, but any machine with this chip in it is quite obsolete and this document will not attempt to address issues for compiling Perl on the Motorola chipset.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The version of PA-RISC at the time of this document's last update is 2.0, which is also the last there will be. HP PA-RISC systems are usually refered to with model description &quot;HP 9000&quot;. The last CPU in this series is the PA-8900.  Support for PA-RISC architectured machines officially ends as shown in the following table:<div class="spacer">

<h2>Portability Between PA-RISC Versions</h2> An executable compiled on a PA-RISC 2.0 platform will not execute on a PA-RISC 1.1 platform, even if they are running the same version of HP-UX.  If you are building Perl on a PA-RISC 2.0 platform and want that Perl to also run on a PA-RISC 1.1, the compiler flags +DAportable and +DS32 should be used.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is no longer possible to compile PA-RISC 1.0 executables on either the PA-RISC 1.1 or 2.0 platforms.  The command-line flags are accepted, but the resulting executable will not run when transferred to a PA-RISC 1.0 system.</div>

<h2>Itanium Processor Family (IPF) and HP-UX</h2> HP-UX also runs on the new Itanium processor.  This requires the use of a different version of HP-UX (currently 11.23 or 11i v2), and with the exception of a few differences detailed below and in later sections, Perl should compile with no problems.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Although PA-RISC binaries can run on Itanium systems, you should not attempt to use a PA-RISC version of Perl on an Itanium system.  This is because shared libraries created on an Itanium system cannot be loaded while running a PA-RISC executable.<div class="spacer">

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Building Dynamic Extensions on HP-UX</h2> HP-UX supports dynamically loadable libraries (shared libraries). Shared libraries end with the suffix .sl.  On Itanium systems, they end with the suffix .so.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Shared libraries created on a platform using a particular PA-RISC version are not usable on platforms using an earlier PA-RISC version by default.  However, this backwards compatibility may be enabled using the same +DAportable compiler flag (with the same PA-RISC 1.0 caveat mentioned above).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Shared libraries created on an Itanium platform cannot be loaded on a PA-RISC platform.  Shared libraries created on a PA-RISC platform can only be loaded on an Itanium platform if it is a PA-RISC executable that is attempting to load the PA-RISC library.  A PA-RISC shared library cannot be loaded into an Itanium executable nor vice-versa.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To create a shared library, the following steps must be performed:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  1. Compile source modules with +z or +Z flag to create a .o module<br/>
     which contains Position-Independent Code (PIC).  The linker will<br/>
     tell you in the next step if +Z was needed.<br/>
     (For gcc, the appropriate flag is -fpic or -fPIC.)<br/>
<br/>
  2. Link the shared library using the -b flag.  If the code calls<br/>
     any functions in other system libraries (e.g., libm), it must<br/>
     be included on this line.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(Note that these steps are usually handled automatically by the extension's Makefile).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If these dependent libraries are not listed at shared library creation time, you will get fatal &quot;Unresolved symbol&quot; errors at run time when the library is loaded.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may create a shared library that refers to another library, which may be either an archive library or a shared library.  If this second library is a shared library, this is called a &quot;dependent library&quot;.  The dependent library's name is recorded in the main shared library, but it is not linked into the shared library.  Instead, it is loaded when the main shared library is loaded.  This can cause problems if you build an extension on one system and move it to another system where the libraries may not be located in the same place as on the first system.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the referred library is an archive library, then it is treated as a simple collection of .o modules (all of which must contain PIC).  These modules are then linked into the shared library.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that it is okay to create a library which contains a dependent library that is already linked into perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some extensions, like DB_File and Compress::Zlib use/require prebuilt libraries for the perl extensions/modules to work. If these libraries are built using the default configuration, it might happen that you run into an error like &quot;invalid loader fixup&quot; during load phase. HP is aware of this problem.  Search the HP-UX cxx-dev forums for discussions about the subject.  The short answer is that  <b>everything</b> (all libraries, everything) must be compiled with &quot;+z&quot; or &quot;+Z&quot; to be PIC (position independent code).  (For gcc, that would be &quot;-fpic&quot; or &quot;-fPIC&quot;).  In HP-UX 11.00 or newer the linker error message should tell the name of the offending object file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A more general approach is to intervene manually, as with an example for the DB_File module, which requires SleepyCat's libdb.sl:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  # cd .../db-3.2.9/build_unix<br/>
  # vi Makefile<br/>
  ... add +Z to all cflags to create shared objects<br/>
  CFLAGS=         -c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z -Ae +O2 +Onolimit \<br/>
                  -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/X11R6<br/>
  CXXFLAGS=       -c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z -Ae +O2 +Onolimit \<br/>
                  -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/X11R6<br/>
<br/>
  # make clean<br/>
  # make<br/>
  # mkdir tmp<br/>
  # cd tmp<br/>
  # ar x ../libdb.a<br/>
  # ld -b -o libdb-3.2.sl *.o<br/>
  # mv libdb-3.2.sl /usr/local/lib<br/>
  # rm *.o<br/>
  # cd /usr/local/lib<br/>
  # rm -f libdb.sl<br/>
  # ln -s libdb-3.2.sl libdb.sl<br/>
<br/>
  # cd .../DB_File-1.76<br/>
  # make distclean<br/>
  # perl Makefile.PL<br/>
  # make<br/>
  # make test<br/>
  # make install<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
As of db-4.2.x it is no longer needed to do this by hand. Sleepycat has changed the configuration process to add +z on HP-UX automatically.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  # cd .../db-4.2.25/build_unix<br/>
  # env CFLAGS=+DD64 LDFLAGS=+DD64 ../dist/configure<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
should work to generate 64bit shared libraries for HP-UX 11.00 and 11i.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is no longer possible to link PA-RISC 1.0 shared libraries (even though the command-line flags are still present).<div class="spacer">
</div>
PA-RISC and Itanium object files are not interchangeable.  Although you may be able to use ar to create an archive library of PA-RISC object files on an Itanium system, you cannot link against it using an Itanium link editor.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The HP ANSI C Compiler</h2> When using this compiler to build Perl, you should make sure that the flag -Aa is added to the cpprun and cppstdin variables in the config.sh file (though see the section on 64-bit perl below). If you are using a recent version of the Perl distribution, these flags are set automatically.<div class="spacer">

Even though HP-UX 10.20 and 11.00 are not actively maintained by HP anymore, updates for the HP ANSI C compiler are still available from time to time, and it might be advisable to see if updates are applicable. At the moment of writing, the latests available patches for 11.00 that should be applied are PHSS_35098, PHSS_35175, PHSS_35100, PHSS_33036, and PHSS_33902). If you have a SUM account, you can use it to search for updates/patches. Enter &quot;ANSI&quot; as keyword.</div>

<h2>The GNU C Compiler</h2> When you are going to use the GNU C compiler (gcc), and you don't have gcc yet, you can either build it yourself from the sources (available from e.g. &lt;http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/software/gcc/releases.html&gt;) or fetch a prebuilt binary from the HP porting center. gcc prebuilds can be fetched from &lt;http://h21007.www2.hp.com/dspp/tech/tech_TechSoftwareDetailPage_IDX/1,1703,547,00.html&gt; (Browse through the list, because there are often multiple versions of the same package available).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Above mentioned distributions are depots. H.Merijn Brand has made prebuilt gcc binaries available on &lt;http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/&gt; and/or &lt;http://www.cmve.net/~merijn/&gt; for HP-UX 10.20, HP-UX 11.00, HP-UX 11.11 (HP-UX 11i v1), and HP-UX 11.23 (HP-UX 11i v2) in both 32- and 64-bit versions. These are bzipped tar archives that also include recent GNU binutils and GNU gdb.  Read the instructions on that page to rebuild gcc using itself.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On PA-RISC you need a different compiler for 32-bit applications and for 64-bit applications. On PA-RISC, 32-bit objects and 64-bit objects do not mix. Period. There is no different behaviour for HP C-ANSI-C or GNU gcc. So if you require your perl binary to use 64-bit libraries, like Oracle-64bit, you MUST build a 64-bit perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Building a 64-bit capable gcc on PA-RISC from source is possible only when you have the HP C-ANSI C compiler or an already working 64-bit binary of gcc available. Best performance for perl is achieved with HP's native compiler.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Using Large Files with Perl on HP-UX</h2> Beginning with HP-UX version 10.20, files larger than 2GB (2^31 bytes) may be created and manipulated.  Three separate methods of doing this are available.  Of these methods, the best method for Perl is to compile using the -Duselargefiles flag to Configure.  This causes Perl to be compiled using structures and functions in which these are 64 bits wide, rather than 32 bits wide.  (Note that this will only work with HP's ANSI C compiler.  If you want to compile Perl using gcc, you will have to get a version of the compiler that supports 64-bit operations. See above for where to find it.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are some drawbacks to this approach.  One is that any extension which calls any file-manipulating C function will need to be recompiled (just follow the usual &quot;perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install&quot; procedure).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The list of functions that will need to recompiled is:<br/>
  creat,          fgetpos,        fopen,<br/>
  freopen,        fsetpos,        fstat,<br/>
  fstatvfs,       fstatvfsdev,    ftruncate,<br/>
  ftw,            lockf,          lseek,<br/>
  lstat,          mmap,           nftw,<br/>
  open,           prealloc,       stat,<br/>
  statvfs,        statvfsdev,     tmpfile,<br/>
  truncate,       getrlimit,      setrlimit<div class="spacer">
</div>
Another drawback is only valid for Perl versions before 5.6.0.  This drawback is that the seek and tell functions (both the builtin version and POSIX module version) will not perform correctly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is strongly recommended that you use this flag when you run Configure.  If you do not do this, but later answer the question about large files when Configure asks you, you may get a configuration that cannot be compiled, or that does not function as expected.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Threaded Perl on HP-UX</h2> It is possible to compile a version of threaded Perl on any version of HP-UX before 10.30, but it is strongly suggested that you be running on HP-UX 11.00 at least.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To compile Perl with threads, add -Dusethreads to the arguments of Configure.  Verify that the -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L compiler flag is automatically added to the list of flags.  Also make sure that -lpthread is listed before -lc in the list of libraries to link Perl with. The hints provided for HP-UX during Configure will try very hard to get this right for you.<div class="spacer">
</div>
HP-UX versions before 10.30 require a separate installation of a POSIX threads library package. Two examples are the HP DCE package, available on &quot;HP-UX Hardware Extensions 3.0, Install and Core OS, Release 10.20, April 1999 (B3920-13941)&quot; or the Freely available PTH package, available on H.Merijn's site (&lt;http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/&gt;). The use of PTH will be unsupported in perl-5.12 and up and is rather buggy in 5.11.x.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are going to use the HP DCE package, the library used for threading is /usr/lib/libcma.sl, but there have been multiple updates of that library over time. Perl will build with the first version, but it will not pass the test suite. Older Oracle versions might be a compelling reason not to update that library, otherwise please find a newer version in one of the following patches: PHSS_19739, PHSS_20608, or PHSS_23672<div class="spacer">

For building perl to support Oracle, it needs to be linked with libcl and libpthread. So even if your perl is an unthreaded build, these libraries might be required. See &quot;Oracle on HP-UX&quot; below.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>64-bit Perl on HP-UX</h2> Beginning with HP-UX 11.00, programs compiled under HP-UX can take advantage of the LP64 programming environment (LP64 means Longs and Pointers are 64 bits wide), in which scalar variables will be able to hold numbers larger than 2^32 with complete precision.  Perl has proven to be consistent and reliable in 64bit mode since 5.8.1 on all HP-UX 11.xx.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As of the date of this document, Perl is fully 64-bit compliant on HP-UX 11.00 and up for both cc- and gcc builds. If you are about to build a 64-bit perl with GNU gcc, please read the gcc section carefully.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Should a user have the need for compiling Perl in the LP64 environment, use the -Duse64bitall flag to Configure.  This will force Perl to be compiled in a pure LP64 environment (with the +DD64 flag for HP C-ANSI-C, with no additional options for GNU gcc 64-bit on PA-RISC, and with -mlp64 for GNU gcc on Itanium). If you want to compile Perl using gcc, you will have to get a version of the compiler that supports 64-bit operations.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can also use the -Duse64bitint flag to Configure.  Although there are some minor differences between compiling Perl with this flag versus the -Duse64bitall flag, they should not be noticeable from a Perl user's perspective. When configuring -Duse64bitint using a 64bit gcc on a pa-risc architecture, -Duse64bitint is silently promoted to -Duse64bitall.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In both cases, it is strongly recommended that you use these flags when you run Configure.  If you do not use do this, but later answer the questions about 64-bit numbers when Configure asks you, you may get a configuration that cannot be compiled, or that does not function as expected.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Oracle on HP-UX</h2> Using perl to connect to Oracle databases through DBI and DBD::Oracle has caused a lot of people many headaches. Read README.hpux in the DBD::Oracle for much more information. The reason to mention it here is that Oracle requires a perl built with libcl and libpthread, the latter even when perl is build without threads. Building perl using all defaults, but still enabling to build DBD::Oracle later on can be achieved using<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  Configure -A prepend:libswanted='cl pthread ' ...<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Do not forget the space before the trailing quote.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Also note that this does not (yet) work with all configurations, it is known to fail with 64-bit versions of GCC.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>GDBM and Threads on HP-UX</h2> If you attempt to compile Perl with (POSIX) threads on an 11.X system and also link in the GDBM library, then Perl will immediately core dump when it starts up.  The only workaround at this point is to relink the GDBM library under 11.X, then relink it into Perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
the error might show something like:<div class="spacer">
</div>
Pthread internal error: message: _<i>_libc_reinit()</i> failed, file: ../pthreads/pthread.c, line: 1096 Return Pointer is 0xc082bf33 sh: 5345 Quit(coredump)<div class="spacer">
</div>
and Configure will give up.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>NFS filesystems and <i>utime</i>(2) on HP-UX</h2> If you are compiling Perl on a remotely-mounted NFS filesystem, the test io/fs.t may fail on test #18.  This appears to be a bug in HP-UX and no fix is currently available.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>HP-UX Kernel Parameters (maxdsiz) for Compiling Perl</h2> By default, HP-UX comes configured with a maximum data segment size of 64MB.  This is too small to correctly compile Perl with the maximum optimization levels.  You can increase the size of the maxdsiz kernel parameter through the use of SAM.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When using the GUI version of SAM, click on the Kernel Configuration icon, then the Configurable Parameters icon.  Scroll down and select the maxdsiz line.  From the Actions menu, select the Modify Configurable Parameter item.  Insert the new formula into the Formula/Value box. Then follow the instructions to rebuild your kernel and reboot your system.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In general, a value of 256MB (or &quot;256*1024*1024&quot;) is sufficient for Perl to compile at maximum optimization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>nss_delete core dump from op/pwent or op/grent</h1> You may get a bus error core dump from the op/pwent or op/grent tests. If compiled with -g you will see a stack trace much like the following:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  #0  0xc004216c in  () from /usr/lib/libc.2<br/>
  #1  0xc00d7550 in __nss_src_state_destr () from /usr/lib/libc.2<br/>
  #2  0xc00d7768 in __nss_src_state_destr () from /usr/lib/libc.2<br/>
  #3  0xc00d78a8 in nss_delete () from /usr/lib/libc.2<br/>

  #9  0x2005c in main () from ./perl<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The key here is the &quot;nss_delete&quot; call.  One workaround for this bug seems to be to create add to the file  <i>/etc/nsswitch.conf</i> (at least) the following lines<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  group: files<br/>
  passwd: files<br/>
<div class="spacer">

Whether you are using NIS does not matter.  Amazingly enough, the same bug also affects Solaris.</div>

<h1>Miscellaneous</h1> HP-UX 11 Y2K patch &quot;Y2K-1100 B.11.00.B0125 HP-UX Core OS Year 2000 Patch Bundle&quot; has been reported to break the io/fs test #18 which tests whether  <i>utime()</i> can change timestamps.  The Y2K patch seems to break  <i>utime()</i> so that over NFS the timestamps do not get changed (on local filesystems  <i>utime()</i> still works).
