<h1>NAME</h1> perlgit - Detailed information about git and the Perl repository</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document provides details on using git to develop Perl. If you are just interested in working on a quick patch, see perlhack first. This document is intended for people who are regular contributors to Perl, including those with write access to the git repository.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CLONING THE REPOSITORY</h1> All of Perl's source code is kept centrally in a Git repository at  <i>perl5.git.perl.org</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can make a read-only clone of the repository by running:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git clone git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git perl<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This uses the git protocol (port 9418).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you cannot use the git protocol for firewall reasons, you can also clone via http, though this is much slower:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git clone http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git perl<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>WORKING WITH THE REPOSITORY</h1> Once you have changed into the repository directory, you can inspect it. After a clone the repository will contain a single local branch, which will be the current branch as well, as indicated by the asterisk.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git branch<br/>
  * blead<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Using the -a switch to &quot;branch&quot; will also show the remote tracking branches in the repository:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git branch -a<br/>
  * blead<br/>
    origin/HEAD<br/>
    origin/blead<br/>
  ...<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The branches that begin with &quot;origin&quot; correspond to the &quot;git remote&quot; that you cloned from (which is named &quot;origin&quot;). Each branch on the remote will be exactly tracked by theses branches. You should NEVER do work on these remote tracking branches. You only ever do work in a local branch. Local branches can be configured to automerge (on pull) from a designated remote tracking branch. This is the case with the default branch &quot;blead&quot; which will be configured to merge from the remote tracking branch &quot;origin/blead&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can see recent commits:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git log<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And pull new changes from the repository, and update your local repository (must be clean first)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git pull<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Assuming we are on the branch &quot;blead&quot; immediately after a pull, this command would be more or less equivalent to:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git fetch<br/>
  % git merge origin/blead<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In fact if you want to update your local repository without touching your working directory you do:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git fetch<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And if you want to update your remote-tracking branches for all defined remotes simultaneously you can do<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git remote update<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Neither of these last two commands will update your working directory, however both will update the remote-tracking branches in your repository.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To make a local branch of a remote branch:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git checkout -b maint-5.10 origin/maint-5.10<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To switch back to blead:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git checkout blead<br/>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Finding out your status</h2> The most common git command you will use will probably be<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git status<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This command will produce as output a description of the current state of the repository, including modified files and unignored untracked files, and in addition it will show things like what files have been staged for the next commit, and usually some useful information about how to change things. For instance the following:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  $ git status<br/>
  # On branch blead<br/>
  # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/blead' by 1 commit.<br/>
  #<br/>
  # Changes to be committed:<br/>
  #   (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)<br/>
  #<br/>
  #       modified:   pod/perlgit.pod<br/>
  #<br/>
  # Changed but not updated:<br/>
  #   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)<br/>
  #<br/>
  #       modified:   pod/perlgit.pod<br/>
  #<br/>
  # Untracked files:<br/>
  #   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)<br/>
  #<br/>
  #       deliberate.untracked<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This shows that there were changes to this document staged for commit, and that there were further changes in the working directory not yet staged. It also shows that there was an untracked file in the working directory, and as you can see shows how to change all of this. It also shows that there is one commit on the working branch &quot;blead&quot; which has not been pushed to the &quot;origin&quot; remote yet.  <b>NOTE</b>: that this output is also what you see as a template if you do not provide a message to &quot;git commit&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Patch workflow</h2> First, please read perlhack for details on hacking the Perl core. That document covers many details on how to create a good patch.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you already have a Perl repository, you should ensure that you're on the  <i>blead</i> branch, and your repository is up to date:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git checkout blead<br/>
  % git pull<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It's preferable to patch against the latest blead version, since this is where new development occurs for all changes other than critical bug fixes. Critical bug fix patches should be made against the relevant maint branches, or should be submitted with a note indicating all the branches where the fix should be applied.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now that we have everything up to date, we need to create a temporary new branch for these changes and switch into it:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git checkout -b orange<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
which is the short form of<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git branch orange<br/>
  % git checkout orange<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Creating a topic branch makes it easier for the maintainers to rebase or merge back into the master blead for a more linear history. If you don't work on a topic branch the maintainer has to manually cherry pick your changes onto blead before they can be applied.<div class="spacer">
</div>
That'll get you scolded on perl5-porters, so don't do that. Be Awesome.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Then make your changes. For example, if Leon Brocard changes his name to Orange Brocard, we should change his name in the AUTHORS file:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % perl -pi -e 's{Leon Brocard}{Orange Brocard}' AUTHORS<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can see what files are changed:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git status<br/>
  # On branch orange<br/>
  # Changes to be committed:<br/>
  #   (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)<br/>
  #<br/>
  #    modified:   AUTHORS<br/>
  #<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And you can see the changes:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>

The &quot;-a&quot; option is used to include all files that git tracks that you have changed. If at this time, you only want to commit some of the files you have worked on, you can omit the &quot;-a&quot; and use the command &quot;git&#160;add&#160; <i>FILE&#160;...</i>&quot; before doing the commit. &quot;git&#160;add&#160;--interactive&quot; allows you to even just commit portions of files instead of all the changes in them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;-m&quot; option is used to specify the commit message. If you omit it, git will open a text editor for you to compose the message interactively. This is useful when the changes are more complex than the sample given here, and, depending on the editor, to know that the first line of the commit message doesn't exceed the 50 character legal maximum.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Once you've finished writing your commit message and exited your editor, git will write your change to disk and tell you something like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  Created commit daf8e63: explain git status and stuff about remotes<br/>
   1 files changed, 83 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you re-run &quot;git status&quot;, you should see something like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git status<br/>
  # On branch blead<br/>
  # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/blead' by 2 commits.<br/>
  #<br/>
  # Untracked files:<br/>
  #   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)<br/>
  #<br/>
  #       deliberate.untracked<br/>
  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When in doubt, before you do anything else, check your status and read it carefully, many questions are answered directly by the git status output.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can examine your last commit with:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git show HEAD<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
and if you are not happy with either the description or the patch itself you can fix it up by editing the files once more and then issue:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git commit -a --amend<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now you should create a patch file for all your local changes:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git format-patch -M origin..<br/>
  0001-Rename-Leon-Brocard-to-Orange-Brocard.patch<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You should now send an email to to perlbug@perl.org &lt;mailto:perlbug@perl.org&gt; with a description of your changes, and include this patch file as an attachment. In addition to being tracked by RT, mail to perlbug will automatically be forwarded to perl5-porters (with manual moderation, so please be patient). You should only send patches to perl5-porters@perl.org &lt;mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org&gt; directly if the patch is not ready to be applied, but intended for discussion.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the next section for how to configure and use git to send these emails for you.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to delete your temporary branch, you may do so with:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git checkout blead<br/>
  % git branch -d orange<br/>
  error: The branch 'orange' is not an ancestor of your current HEAD.<br/>
  If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D orange'.<br/>
  % git branch -D orange<br/>
  Deleted branch orange.<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Committing your changes</h2> Assuming that you'd like to commit all the changes you've made as a single atomic unit, run this command:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
   % git commit -a<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(That &quot;-a&quot; tells git to add every file you've changed to this commit. New files aren't automatically added to your commit when you use &quot;commit -a&quot; If you want to add files or to commit some, but not all of your changes, have a look at the documentation for &quot;git add&quot;.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Git will start up your favorite text editor, so that you can craft a commit message for your change. See &quot;Commit message&quot; in perlhack for more information about what makes a good commit message.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Once you've finished writing your commit message and exited your editor, git will write your change to disk and tell you something like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  Created commit daf8e63: explain git status and stuff about remotes<br/>
   1 files changed, 83 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you re-run &quot;git status&quot;, you should see something like this:<div class="spacer">

<br/>
  % git status<br/>
  # On branch blead<br/>
  # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/blead' by 2 commits.<br/>
  #<br/>

<div class="spacer">
</div>
When in doubt, before you do anything else, check your status and read it carefully, many questions are answered directly by the git status output.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Using git to send patch emails</h2> Please read perlhack first in order to figure out where your patches should be sent.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In your ~/git/perl repository, set the destination email to perl's bug tracker:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  $ git config sendemail.to perlbug@perl.org<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Or maybe perl5-porters:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  $ git config sendemail.to perl5-porters@perl.org<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Then you can use git directly to send your patch emails:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  $ git send-email 0001-Rename-Leon-Brocard-to-Orange-Brocard.patch<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may need to set some configuration variables for your particular email service provider. For example, to set your global git config to send email via a gmail account:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  $ git config --global sendemail.smtpserver smtp.gmail.com<br/>
  $ git config --global sendemail.smtpssl 1<br/>
  $ git config --global sendemail.smtpuser YOURUSERNAME@gmail.com<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
With this configuration, you will be prompted for your gmail password when you run 'git send-email'. You can also configure &quot;sendemail.smtppass&quot; with your password if you don't care about having your password in the .gitconfig file.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>A note on derived files</h2> Be aware that many files in the distribution are derivative--avoid patching them, because git won't see the changes to them, and the build process will overwrite them. Patch the originals instead. Most utilities (like perldoc) are in this category, i.e. patch  <i>utils/perldoc.PL</i> rather than <i>utils/perldoc</i>. Similarly, don't create patches for files under $src_root/ext from their copies found in $install_root/lib. If you are unsure about the proper location of a file that may have gotten copied while building the source distribution, consult the &quot;MANIFEST&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Cleaning a working directory</h2> The command &quot;git clean&quot; can with varying arguments be used as a replacement for &quot;make clean&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To reset your working directory to a pristine condition you can do:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git clean -dxf<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, be aware this will delete ALL untracked content. You can use<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git clean -Xf<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
to remove all ignored untracked files, such as build and test byproduct, but leave any  manually created files alone.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you only want to cancel some uncommitted edits, you can use &quot;git checkout&quot; and give it a list of files to be reverted, or &quot;git checkout -f&quot; to revert them all.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to cancel one or several commits, you can use &quot;git reset&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Bisecting</h2> &quot;git&quot; provides a built-in way to determine, with a binary search in the history, which commit should be blamed for introducing a given bug.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Suppose that we have a script <i>~/testcase.pl</i> that exits with 0 when some behaviour is correct, and with 1 when it's faulty. You need an helper script that automates building &quot;perl&quot; and running the testcase:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % cat ~/run<br/>
  #!/bin/sh<br/>
  git clean -dxf<br/>
<br/>
  # If you get './makedepend: 1: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted<br/>
  # string' when bisecting versions of perl older than 5.9.5 this hack<br/>
  # will work around the bug in makedepend.SH which was fixed in<br/>
  # version 96a8704c. Make sure to comment out `git checkout makedepend.SH'<br/>
  # below too.<br/>
  git show blead:makedepend.SH &gt; makedepend.SH<br/>
<br/>
  # If you can use ccache, add -Dcc=ccache\ gcc -Dld=gcc to the Configure line<br/>
  # if Encode is not needed for the test, you can speed up the bisect by<br/>
  # excluding it from the runs with -Dnoextensions=Encode<br/>
  sh Configure -des -Dusedevel -Doptimize=&quot;-g&quot;<br/>
  test -f config.sh || exit 125<br/>
  # Correct makefile for newer GNU gcc<br/>
  perl -ni -we 'print unless /&lt;(?:built-in|command)/' makefile x2p/makefile<br/>
  # if you just need miniperl, replace test_prep with miniperl<br/>
  make test_prep<br/>
  [ -x ./perl ] || exit 125<br/>
  ./perl -Ilib ~/testcase.pl<br/>
  ret=$?<br/>
  [ $ret -gt 127 ] &amp;&amp; ret=127<br/>
  # git checkout makedepend.SH<br/>
  git clean -dxf<br/>
  exit $ret<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This script may return 125 to indicate that the corresponding commit should be skipped. Otherwise, it returns the status of  <i>~/testcase.pl</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You first enter in bisect mode with:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git bisect start<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, if the bug is present on &quot;HEAD&quot; but wasn't in 5.10.0, &quot;git&quot; will learn about this when you enter:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git bisect bad<br/>
  % git bisect good perl-5.10.0<br/>
  Bisecting: 853 revisions left to test after this<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This results in checking out the median commit between &quot;HEAD&quot; and &quot;perl-5.10.0&quot;. You can then run the bisecting process with:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git bisect run ~/run<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the first bad commit is isolated, &quot;git bisect&quot; will tell you so:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>

<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can peek into the bisecting process with &quot;git bisect log&quot; and &quot;git bisect visualize&quot;. &quot;git bisect reset&quot; will get you out of bisect mode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Please note that the first &quot;good&quot; state must be an ancestor of the first &quot;bad&quot; state. If you want to search for the commit that  <i>solved</i> some bug, you have to negate your test case (i.e. exit with 1 if OK and 0 if not) and still mark the lower bound as &quot;good&quot; and the upper as &quot;bad&quot;. The &quot;first bad commit&quot; has then to be understood as the &quot;first commit where the bug is solved&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;git help bisect&quot; has much more information on how you can tweak your binary searches. =head1 Topic branches and rewriting history<div class="spacer">
</div>
Individual committers should create topic branches under  <b>yourname</b>/<b>some_descriptive_name</b>. Other committers should check with a topic branch's creator before making any change to it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The simplest way to create a remote topic branch that works on all versions of git is to push the current head as a new branch on the remote, then check it out locally:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  $ branch=&quot;$yourname/$some_descriptive_name&quot;<br/>
  $ git push origin HEAD:$branch<br/>
  $ git checkout -b $branch origin/$branch<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Users of git 1.7 or newer can do it in a more obvious manner:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  $ branch=&quot;$yourname/$some_descriptive_name&quot;<br/>
  $ git checkout -b $branch<br/>
  $ git push origin -u $branch<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are not the creator of <b>yourname</b>/<b>some_descriptive_name</b>, you might sometimes find that the original author has edited the branch's history. There are lots of good reasons for this. Sometimes, an author might simply be rebasing the branch onto a newer source point. Sometimes, an author might have found an error in an early commit which they wanted to fix before merging the branch to blead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Currently the master repository is configured to forbid non-fast-forward merges. This means that the branches within can not be rebased and pushed as a single step.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The only way you will ever be allowed to rebase or modify the history of a pushed branch is to delete it and push it as a new branch under the same name. Please think carefully about doing this. It may be better to sequentially rename your branches so that it is easier for others working with you to cherry-pick their local changes onto the new version. (XXX: needs explanation).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to rebase a personal topic branch, you will have to delete your existing topic branch and push as a new version of it. You can do this via the following formula (see the explanation about &quot;refspec&quot;'s in the git push documentation for details) after you have rebased your branch:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
   # first rebase<br/>
   $ git checkout $user/$topic<br/>
   $ git fetch<br/>
   $ git rebase origin/blead<br/>
<br/>
   # then &quot;delete-and-push&quot;<br/>
   $ git push origin :$user/$topic<br/>
   $ git push origin $user/$topic<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>NOTE:</b> it is forbidden at the repository level to delete any of the &quot;primary&quot; branches. That is any branch matching &quot;m!^(blead|maint|perl)!&quot;. Any attempt to do so will result in git producing an error like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $ git push origin :blead<br/>
    *** It is forbidden to delete blead/maint branches in this repository<br/>
    error: hooks/update exited with error code 1<br/>
    error: hook declined to update refs/heads/blead<br/>
    To ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/perl<br/>
     ! [remote rejected] blead (hook declined)<br/>
     error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/perl'<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a matter of policy we do <b>not</b> edit the history of the blead and maint-* branches. If a typo (or worse) sneaks into a commit to blead or maint-*, we'll fix it in another commit.

<i>Grafts</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The perl history contains one mistake which was not caught in the conversion: a merge was recorded in the history between blead and maint-5.10 where no merge actually occurred. Due to the nature of git, this is now impossible to fix in the public repository. You can remove this mis-merge locally by adding the following line to your &quot;.git/info/grafts&quot; file:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>

<div class="spacer">

It is particularly important to have this graft line if any bisecting is done in the area of the &quot;merge&quot; in question.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Topic branches and rewriting history</h2> Individual committers should create topic branches under  <b>yourname</b>/<b>some_descriptive_name</b>. Other committers should check with a topic branch's creator before making any change to it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The simplest way to create a remote topic branch that works on all versions of git is to push the current head as a new branch on the remote, then check it out locally:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  $ branch=&quot;$yourname/$some_descriptive_name&quot;<br/>
  $ git push origin HEAD:$branch<br/>
  $ git checkout -b $branch origin/$branch<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Users of git 1.7 or newer can do it in a more obvious manner:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  $ branch=&quot;$yourname/$some_descriptive_name&quot;<br/>
  $ git checkout -b $branch<br/>
  $ git push origin -u $branch<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are not the creator of <b>yourname</b>/<b>some_descriptive_name</b>, you might sometimes find that the original author has edited the branch's history. There are lots of good reasons for this. Sometimes, an author might simply be rebasing the branch onto a newer source point. Sometimes, an author might have found an error in an early commit which they wanted to fix before merging the branch to blead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Currently the master repository is configured to forbid non-fast-forward merges. This means that the branches within can not be rebased and pushed as a single step.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The only way you will ever be allowed to rebase or modify the history of a pushed branch is to delete it and push it as a new branch under the same name. Please think carefully about doing this. It may be better to sequentially rename your branches so that it is easier for others working with you to cherry-pick their local changes onto the new version. (XXX: needs explanation).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to rebase a personal topic branch, you will have to delete your existing topic branch and push as a new version of it. You can do this via the following formula (see the explanation about &quot;refspec&quot;'s in the git push documentation for details) after you have rebased your branch:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
   # first rebase<br/>
   $ git checkout $user/$topic<br/>
   $ git fetch<br/>
   $ git rebase origin/blead<br/>
<br/>
   # then &quot;delete-and-push&quot;<br/>
   $ git push origin :$user/$topic<br/>
   $ git push origin $user/$topic<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>NOTE:</b> it is forbidden at the repository level to delete any of the &quot;primary&quot; branches. That is any branch matching &quot;m!^(blead|maint|perl)!&quot;. Any attempt to do so will result in git producing an error like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $ git push origin :blead<br/>
    *** It is forbidden to delete blead/maint branches in this repository<br/>
    error: hooks/update exited with error code 1<br/>
    error: hook declined to update refs/heads/blead<br/>
    To ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/perl<br/>
     ! [remote rejected] blead (hook declined)<br/>
     error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/perl'<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a matter of policy we do <b>not</b> edit the history of the blead and maint-* branches. If a typo (or worse) sneaks into a commit to blead or maint-*, we'll fix it in another commit. The only types of updates allowed on these branches are &quot;fast-forward's&quot;, where all history is preserved.<div class="spacer">
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>WRITE ACCESS TO THE GIT REPOSITORY</h1> Once you have write access, you will need to modify the URL for the origin remote to enable pushing. Edit  <i>.git/config</i> with the  <i>git-config</i>(1) command:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git config remote.origin.url ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can also set up your user name and e-mail address. Most people do this once globally in their  <i>~/.gitconfig</i> by doing something like:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git config --global user.name &quot;var Arnfjoerd` Bjarmason&quot;<br/>
  % git config --global user.email avarab@gmail.com<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
However if you'd like to override that just for perl then execute then execute something like the following in  <i>perl</i>:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git config user.email avar@cpan.org<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is also possible to keep &quot;origin&quot; as a git remote, and add a new remote for ssh access:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git remote add camel perl5.git.perl.org:/perl.git<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This allows you to update your local repository by pulling from &quot;origin&quot;, which is faster and doesn't require you to authenticate, and to push your changes back with the &quot;camel&quot; remote:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git fetch camel<br/>
  % git push camel<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;fetch&quot; command just updates the &quot;camel&quot; refs, as the objects themselves should have been fetched when pulling from &quot;origin&quot;. =head1 Accepting a patch<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you have received a patch file generated using the above section, you should try out the patch.<div class="spacer">
</div>
First we need to create a temporary new branch for these changes and switch into it:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git checkout -b experimental<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Patches that were formatted by &quot;git format-patch&quot; are applied with &quot;git am&quot;:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git am 0001-Rename-Leon-Brocard-to-Orange-Brocard.patch<br/>
  Applying Rename Leon Brocard to Orange Brocard<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If just a raw diff is provided, it is also possible use this two-step process:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git apply bugfix.diff<br/>
  % git commit -a -m &quot;Some fixing&quot; --author=&quot;That Guy &lt;that.guy@internets.com&gt;&quot;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now we can inspect the change:<div class="spacer">

If you are a committer to Perl and you think the patch is good, you can then merge it into blead then push it out to the main repository:<div class="spacer">

<br/>
  % git checkout blead<br/>
  % git merge experimental<br/>
  % git push<br/>
<div class="spacer">

  % git checkout blead<br/>
  % git branch -d experimental<br/>
  error: The branch 'experimental' is not an ancestor of your current HEAD.<br/>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Committing to blead</h2> The 'blead' branch will become the next production release of Perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Before pushing <i>any</i> local change to blead, it's incredibly important that you do a few things, lest other committers come after you with pitchforks and torches:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Make sure you have a good commit message. See &quot;Commit message&quot; in perlhack for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Run the test suite. You might not think that one typo fix would break a test file. You'd be wrong. Here's an example of where not running the suite caused problems. A patch was submitted that added a couple of tests to an existing .t. It couldn't possibly affect anything else, so no need to test beyond the single affected .t, right?  But, the submitter's email address had changed since the last of their submissions, and this caused other tests to fail. Running the test target given in the next item would have caught this problem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
If you don't run the full test suite, at least &quot;make test_porting&quot;. This will run basic sanity checks. To see which sanity checks, have a look in  <i>t/porting</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
If you make any changes that affect miniperl or core routines that have different code paths for miniperl, be sure to run &quot;make minitest&quot;. This will catch problems that even the full test suite will not catch because it runs a subset of tests under miniperl rather than perl.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Committing to maintenance versions</h2> Maintenance versions should only be altered to add critical bug fixes, see perlpolicy.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To commit to a maintenance version of perl, you need to create a local tracking branch:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git checkout --track -b maint-5.005 origin/maint-5.005<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This creates a local branch named &quot;maint-5.005&quot;, which tracks the remote branch &quot;origin/maint-5.005&quot;. Then you can pull, commit, merge and push as before.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can also cherry-pick commits from blead and another branch, by using the &quot;git cherry-pick&quot; command. It is recommended to use the  <b>-x</b> option to &quot;git cherry-pick&quot; in order to record the SHA1 of the original commit in the new commit message.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Before pushing any change to a maint version, make sure you've satisfied the steps in &quot;Committing to blead&quot; above.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Grafts</h2> The perl history contains one mistake which was not caught in the conversion: a merge was recorded in the history between blead and maint-5.10 where no merge actually occurred.

<h2>Merging from a branch via GitHub</h2> While we don't encourage the submission of patches via GitHub, that will still happen. Here is a guide to merging patches from a GitHub repository.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git remote add avar git://github.com/avar/perl.git<br/>
  % git fetch avar<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now you can see the differences between the branch and blead:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git diff avar/orange<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And you can see the commits:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git log avar/orange<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you approve of a specific commit, you can cherry pick it:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git cherry-pick 0c24b290ae02b2ab3304f51d5e11e85eb3659eae<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Or you could just merge the whole branch if you like it all:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git merge avar/orange<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And then push back to the repository:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  % git push<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>A note on camel and dromedary</h2> The committers have SSH access to the two servers that serve &quot;perl5.git.perl.org&quot;. One is &quot;perl5.git.perl.org&quot; itself ( <i>camel</i>), which is the 'master' repository. The second one is &quot;users.perl5.git.perl.org&quot; ( <i>dromedary</i>), which can be used for general testing and development. Dromedary syncs the git tree from camel every few minutes, you should not push there. Both machines also have a full CPAN mirror in /srv/CPAN, please use this. To share files with the general public, dromedary serves your ~/public_html/ as &quot;http://users.perl5.git.perl.org/~yourlogin/&quot;<div class="spacer">
</div>
These hosts have fairly strict firewalls to the outside. Outgoing, only rsync, ssh and git are allowed. For http and ftp, you can use http://webproxy:3128 as proxy. Incoming, the firewall tries to detect attacks and blocks IP addresses with suspicious activity. This sometimes (but very rarely) has false positives and you might get blocked. The quickest way to get unblocked is to notify the admins.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These two boxes are owned, hosted, and operated by booking.com. You can reach the sysadmins in #p5p on irc.perl.org or via mail to &quot;perl5-porters@perl.org&quot;.</div>
