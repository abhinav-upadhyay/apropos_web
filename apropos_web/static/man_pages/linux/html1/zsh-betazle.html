<h1>NAME</h1> zsh-betazle - zsh command line editor</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> If the  <b>ZLE</b> option is set (which it is by default in interactive shells) and the shell input is attached to the terminal, the user is able to edit command lines.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are two display modes.  The first, multiline mode, is the default.  It only works if the  <b>TERM</b> parameter is set to a valid terminal type that can move the cursor up.  The second, single line mode, is used if  <b>TERM</b> is invalid or incapable of moving the cursor up, or if the  <b>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</b> option is set. This mode is similar to  <b>ksh</b>, and uses no termcap sequences.  If <b>TERM</b> is &quot;emacs&quot;, the  <b>ZLE</b> option will be unset by default.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The parameters <b>BAUD</b>, <b>COLUMNS</b>, and <b>LINES</b> are also used by the line editor. See  <i>Parameters Used By The Shell</i> in <i>zsh-betaparam</i>(1).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The parameter <b>zle_highlight</b> is also used by the line editor; see  <i>Character Highlighting</i> below.  Highlighting of special characters and the region between the cursor and the mark (as set with  <b>set-mark-command</b> in Emacs mode) is enabled by default; consult this reference for more information.  Irascible conservatives will wish to know that all highlighting may be disabled by the following setting:<div class="spacer">

<div class="section">
<h1>KEYMAPS</h1> A keymap in ZLE contains a set of bindings between key sequences and ZLE commands.  The empty key sequence cannot be bound.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There can be any number of keymaps at any time, and each keymap has one or more names.  If all of a keymap's names are deleted, it disappears.  <b>bindkey</b> can be used to manipulate keymap names.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Initially, there are six keymaps:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>emacs</b></dt>
<dd>
EMACS emulation</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>viins</b></dt>
<dd>
vi emulation - insert mode</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>vicmd</b></dt>
<dd>
vi emulation - command mode</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>isearch</b></dt>
<dd>
incremental search mode</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>command</b></dt>
<dd>
read a command name</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>.safe</b></dt>
<dd>
fallback keymap</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The `<b>.safe</b>' keymap is special.  It can never be altered, and the name can never be removed.  However, it can be linked to other names, which can be removed.  In the future other special keymaps may be added; users should avoid using names beginning with ` <b>.</b>' for their own keymaps.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In addition to these names, either `<b>emacs</b>' or `<b>viins</b>' is also linked to the name ` <b>main</b>'.  If one of the <b>VISUAL</b> or  <b>EDITOR</b> environment variables contain the string `<b>vi</b>' when the shell starts up then it will be ` <b>viins</b>', otherwise it will be `<b>emacs</b>'.  <b>bindkey</b>'s <b>-e</b> and <b>-v</b> options provide a convenient way to override this default choice.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the editor starts up, it will select the `<b>main</b>' keymap. If that keymap doesn't exist, it will use ` <b>.safe</b>' instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the `<b>.safe</b>' keymap, each single key is bound to <b>self-insert</b>, except for ^J (line feed) and ^M (return) which are bound to  <b>accept-line</b>. This is deliberately not pleasant to use; if you are using it, it means you deleted the main keymap, and you should put it back.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Reading Commands</h2> When ZLE is reading a command from the terminal, it may read a sequence that is bound to some command and is also a prefix of a longer bound string. In this case ZLE will wait a certain time to see if more characters are typed, and if not (or they don't match any longer string) it will execute the binding.  This timeout is defined by the  <b>KEYTIMEOUT</b> parameter; its default is 0.4 sec.  There is no timeout if the prefix string is not itself bound to a command.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The key timeout is also applied when ZLE is reading the bytes from a multibyte character string when it is in the appropriate mode.  (This requires that the shell was compiled with multibyte mode enabled; typically also the locale has characters with the UTF-8 encoding, although any multibyte encoding known to the operating system is supported.)  If the second or a subsequent byte is not read within the timeout period, the shell acts as if  <b>?</b> were typed and resets the input state.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As well as ZLE commands, key sequences can be bound to other strings, by using ` <b>bindkey -s</b>'. When such a sequence is read, the replacement string is pushed back as input, and the command reading process starts again using these fake keystrokes. This input can itself invoke further replacement strings, but in order to detect loops the process will be stopped if there are twenty such replacements without a real command being read.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A key sequence typed by the user can be turned into a command name for use in user-defined widgets with the  <b>read-command</b> widget, described below.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ZLE BUILTINS</h1> The ZLE module contains three related builtin commands. The  <b>bindkey</b> command manipulates keymaps and key bindings; the  <b>vared</b> command invokes ZLE on the value of a shell parameter; and the  <b>zle</b> command manipulates editing widgets and allows command line access to ZLE commands from within shell functions.<div class="spacer">

<b>bindkey</b> [ <i>options</i> ] [ <i>in-string</i> ]  <b>bindkey</b>'s options can be divided into three categories: keymap selection for the current command, operation selection, and others.  The keymap selection options are:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>-e</b> Selects keymap ` <b>emacs</b>' for any operations by the current command, and also links ` <b>emacs</b>' to `<b>main</b>' so that it is selected by default the next time the editor starts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-v</b></dt>
<dd>
Selects keymap `<b>viins</b>' for any operations by the current command, and also links ` <b>viins</b>' to `<b>main</b>' so that it is selected by default the next time the editor starts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-a</b></dt>
<dd>
Selects keymap `<b>vicmd</b>' for any operations by the current command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-M</b> <i>keymap</i></dt>
<dd>
The <i>keymap</i> specifies a keymap name that is selected for any operations by the current command.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a keymap selection is required and none of the options above are used, the ` <b>main</b>' keymap is used.  Some operations do not permit a keymap to be selected, namely:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>-l</b> List all existing keymap names; if any arguments are given, list just those keymaps.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <b>-L</b> option is also used, list in the form of <b>bindkey</b> commands to create or link the keymaps.  ` <b>bindkey -lL</b>  <b>main</b>' shows which keymap is linked to `<b>main</b>', if any, and hence if the standard emacs or vi emulation is in effect.  This option does not show the  <b>.safe</b> keymap because it cannot be created in that fashion; however, neither is ` <b>bindkey -lL .safe</b>' reported as an error, it simply outputs nothing.</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-d</b></dt>
<dd>
Delete all existing keymaps and reset to the default state.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-D</b> <i>keymap</i> ...</dt>
<dd>
Delete the named <i>keymap</i>s.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-A</b> <i>old-keymap new-keymap</i></dt>
<dd>
Make the <i>new-keymap</i> name an alias for <i>old-keymap</i>, so that both names refer to the same keymap.  The names have equal standing; if either is deleted, the other remains.  If there is already a keymap with the  <i>new-keymap</i> name, it is deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-N</b> <i>new-keymap</i> [ <i>old-keymap</i> ]</dt>
<dd>
Create a new keymap, named <i>new-keymap</i>.  If a keymap already has that name, it is deleted.  If an  <i>old-keymap</i> name is given, the new keymap is initialized to be a duplicate of it, otherwise the new keymap will be empty.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To use a newly created keymap, it should be linked to <b>main</b>.  Hence the sequence of commands to create and use a new keymap ` <b>mymap</b>' initialized from the  <b>emacs</b> keymap (which remains unchanged) is:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>bindkey -N mymap emacs</b><br/>
<b>bindkey -A mymap main</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that while `<b>bindkey -A</b> <i>newmap</i> <b>main</b>' will work when  <i>newmap</i> is <b>emacs</b> or <b>viins</b>, it will not work for <b>vicmd</b>, as switching from vi insert to command mode becomes impossible.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following operations act on the `<b>main</b>' keymap if no keymap selection option was given:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>-m</b> Add the built-in set of meta-key bindings to the selected keymap. Only keys that are unbound or bound to  <b>self-insert</b> are affected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-r</b> <i>in-string</i> ...</dt>
<dd>
Unbind the specified <i>in-string</i>s in the selected keymap. This is exactly equivalent to binding the strings to  <b>undefined-key</b>.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <b>-R</b> is also used, interpret the <i>in-string</i>s as ranges.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <b>-p</b> is also used, the <i>in-string</i>s specify prefixes.  Any binding that has the given  <i>in-string</i> as a prefix, not including the binding for the  <i>in-string</i> itself, if any, will be removed.  For example,<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>bindkey -rpM viins '^['</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
will remove all bindings in the vi-insert keymap beginning with an escape character (probably cursor keys), but leave the binding for the escape character itself (probably  <b>vi-cmd-mode</b>).  This is incompatible with the option  <b>-R</b>.</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-s</b> <i>in-string out-string</i> ...</dt>
<dd>
Bind each <i>in-string</i> to each <i>out-string</i>. When  <i>in-string</i> is typed, <i>out-string</i> will be pushed back and treated as input to the line editor. When  <b>-R</b> is also used, interpret the <i>in-string</i>s as ranges.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>in-string command</i> ...</dt>
<dd>
Bind each <i>in-string</i> to each <i>command</i>. When  <b>-R</b> is used, interpret the <i>in-string</i>s as ranges.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[ <i>in-string</i> ]</dt>
<dd>
List key bindings.  If an <i>in-string</i> is specified, the binding of that string in the selected keymap is displayed.  Otherwise, all key bindings in the selected keymap are displayed.  (As a special case, if the  <b>-e</b> or <b>-v</b> option is used alone, the keymap is <i>not</i> displayed - the implicit linking of keymaps is the only thing that happens.)<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the option <b>-p</b> is used, the <i>in-string</i> must be present. The listing shows all bindings which have the given key sequence as a prefix, not including any bindings for the key sequence itself.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the <b>-L</b> option is used, the list is in the form of <b>bindkey</b> commands to create the key bindings.</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the <b>-R</b> option is used as noted above, a valid range consists of two characters, with an optional ` <b>-</b>' between them.  All characters between the two specified, inclusive, are bound as specified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For either <i>in-string</i> or <i>out-string</i>, the following escape sequences are recognised:<div class="spacer">

In all other cases, `<b>\</b>' escapes the following character.  Delete is written as ` <b>^?</b>'.  Note that `<b>\M^?</b>' and `<b>^\M?</b>' are not the same, and that (unlike emacs), the bindings ` <b>\M-</b><i>X</i>' and `<b>\e</b><i>X</i>' are entirely distinct, although they are initialized to the same bindings by ` <b>bindkey -m</b>'.<dl>

  [ <b>-t</b> <i>tty</i> ] <i>name</i> The value of the parameter  <i>name</i> is loaded into the edit buffer, and the line editor is invoked.  When the editor exits,  <i>name</i> is set to the string value returned by the editor. When the  <b>-c</b> flag is given, the parameter is created if it doesn't already exist.  The  <b>-a</b> flag may be given with <b>-c</b> to create an array parameter, or the  <b>-A</b> flag to create an associative array. If the type of an existing parameter does not match the type to be created, the parameter is unset and recreated.</dd>

If an array or array slice is being edited, separator characters as defined in  <b>$IFS</b> will be shown quoted with a backslash, as will backslashes themselves.  Conversely, when the edited text is split into an array, a backslash quotes an immediately following separator character or backslash; no other special handling of backslashes, or any handling of quotes, is performed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Individual elements of existing array or associative array parameters may be edited by using subscript syntax on  <i>name</i>.  New elements are created automatically, even without  <b>-c</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <b>-p</b> flag is given, the following string will be taken as the prompt to display at the left.  If the  <b>-r</b> flag is given, the following string gives the prompt to display at the right.  If the  <b>-h</b> flag is specified, the history can be accessed from ZLE. If the  <b>-e</b> flag is given, typing <b>^D</b> (Control-D) on an empty line causes  <b>vared</b> to exit immediately with a non-zero return value.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-M</b> option gives a keymap to link to the <b>main</b> keymap during editing, and the  <b>-m</b> option gives a keymap to link to the <b>vicmd</b> keymap during editing.  For vi-style editing, this allows a pair of keymaps to override  <b>viins</b> and <b>vicmd</b>.  For emacs-style editing, only <b>-M</b> is normally needed but the  <b>-m</b> option may still be used.  On exit, the previous keymaps will be restored.<div class="spacer">

If `<b>-t</b> <i>tty</i>' is given, <i>tty</i> is the name of a terminal device to be used instead of the default  <b>/dev/tty</b>.  If <i>tty</i> does not refer to a terminal an error is reported.</div>

Note that this option is only useful for widgets that do not exit immediately after using it because the strings displayed will be erased immediately after return from the widget.<div class="spacer">

This command can safely be called outside user defined widgets; if zle is active, the display will be refreshed, while if zle is not active, the command has no effect.  In this case there will usually be no other arguments.<div class="spacer">

</div>
Installs <i>handler</i> (the name of a shell function) to handle input from file descriptor  <i>fd</i>.  When zle is attempting to read data, it will examine both the terminal and the list of handled  <i>fd</i>'s.  If data becomes available on a handled  <i>fd</i>, zle will call <i>handler</i> with the fd which is ready for reading as the only argument.  If the handler produces output to the terminal, it should call ` <b>zle -I</b>' before doing so (see below).  The handler should not attempt to read from the terminal. Note that zle makes no attempt to check whether this fd is actually readable when installing the handler.  The user must make their own arrangements for handling the file descriptor when zle is not active.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any number of handlers for any number of readable file descriptors may be installed.  Installing a handler for an  <i>fd</i> which is already handled causes the existing handler to be replaced.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If no <i>handler</i> is given, but an <i>fd</i> is present, any handler for that  <i>fd</i> is removed.  If there is none, an error message is printed and status 1 is returned.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If no arguments are given, or the <b>-L</b> option is supplied, a list of handlers is printed in a form which can be stored for later execution.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An <i>fd</i> (but not a <i>handler</i>) may optionally be given with the <b>-L</b> option; in this case, the function will list the handler if any, else silently return status 1.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that this feature should be used with care.  Activity on one of the  <i>fd</i>'s which is not properly handled can cause the terminal to become unusable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here is a simple example of using this feature.  A connection to a remote TCP port is created using the ztcp command; see the description of the  <b>zsh/net/tcp</b> module in <i>zsh-betamodules</i>(1).  Then a handler is installed which simply prints out any data which arrives on this connection.  Note that `select' will indicate that the file descriptor needs handling if the remote side has closed the connection; we handle that by testing for a failed read.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>if ztcp pwspc 2811; then</b><br/>
<b>  tcpfd=$REPLY</b><br/>
<b>  handler() {</b><br/>
<b>    zle -I</b><br/>
<b>    local line</b><br/>
<b>    if ! read -r line &lt;&amp;$1; then</b><br/>
<b>      # select marks this fd if we reach EOF,</b><br/>
<b>      # so handle this specially.</b><br/>
<b>      print &quot;[Read on fd $1 failed, removing.]&quot; &gt;&amp;2</b><br/>
<b>      zle -F $1</b><br/>
<b>      return 1</b><br/>
<b>    fi</b><br/>
<b>    print -r - $line</b><br/>

Unusually, this option is most useful outside ordinary widget functions, though it may be used within if normal output to the terminal is required. It invalidates the current zle display in preparation for output; typically this will be from a trap function.  It has no effect if zle is not active.  When a trap exits, the shell checks to see if the display needs restoring, hence the following will print output in such a way as not to disturb the line being edited:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>TRAPUSR1() {</b><br/>
<b>    # Invalidate zle display</b><br/>
<b>  [[ -o zle ]] &amp;&amp; zle -I</b><br/>
<b>    # Show output</b><br/>
<b>  print Hello</b><br/>
<b>}</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In general, the trap function may need to test whether zle is active before using this method (as shown in the example), since the  <b>zsh/zle</b> module may not even be loaded; if it is not, the command can be skipped.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is possible to call `<b>zle -I</b>' several times before control is returned to the editor; the display will only be invalidated the first time to minimise disruption.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that there are normally better ways of manipulating the display from within zle widgets; see, for example, ` <b>zle -R</b>' above.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The returned status is zero if zle was invalidated, even though this may have been by a previous call to ` <b>zle -I</b>' or by a system notification.  To test if a zle widget may be called at this point, execute  <b>zle</b> with no arguments and examine the return status.</div>

<dd>
Invoke the specified widget.  This can only be done when ZLE is active; normally this will be within a user-defined widget.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
With the options <b>-n</b> and <b>-N</b>, the current numerical argument will be saved and then restored after the call to  <b>widget</b>; `<b>-n</b> <i>num</i>' sets the numerical argument temporarily to  <i>num</i>, while `<b>-N</b>' sets it to the default, i.e. as if there were none.<div class="spacer">
</div>
With the option <b>-K</b>, <i>keymap</i> will be used as the current keymap during the execution of the widget.  The previous keymap will be restored when the widget exits.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Normally, calling a widget in this way does not set the special parameter  <b>WIDGET</b> and related parameters, so that the environment appears as if the top-level widget called by the user were still active.  With the option  <b>-w</b>, <b>WIDGET</b> and related parameters are set to reflect the widget being executed by the  <b>zle</b> call.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any further arguments will be passed to the widget; note that as standard argument handling is performed, any general argument list should be preceded by  <b>-</b><b>-</b>.  If it is a shell function, these are passed down as positional parameters; for builtin widgets it is up to the widget in question what it does with them. Currently arguments are only handled by the incremental-search commands, the  <b>history-search-forward</b> and <b>-backward</b> and the corresponding functions prefixed by  <b>vi-</b>, and by <b>universal-argument</b>.  No error is flagged if the command does not use the arguments, or only uses some of them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The return status reflects the success or failure of the operation carried out by the widget, or if it is a user-defined widget the return status of the shell function.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A non-zero return status causes the shell to beep when the widget exits, unless the  <b>BEEP</b> options was unset or the widget was called via the  <b>zle</b> command.  Thus if a user defined widget requires an immediate beep, it should call the  <b>beep</b> widget directly.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>WIDGETS</h1> All actions in the editor are performed by `widgets'.  A widget's job is simply to perform some small action.  The ZLE commands that key sequences in keymaps are bound to are in fact widgets.  Widgets can be user-defined or built in.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The standard widgets built into ZLE are listed in Standard Widgets below. Other built-in widgets can be defined by other modules (see  <i>zsh-betamodules</i>(1)).  Each built-in widget has two names: its normal canonical name, and the same name preceded by a ` <b>.</b>'.  The `<b>.</b>' name is special: it can't be rebound to a different widget.  This makes the widget available even when its usual name has been redefined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
User-defined widgets are defined using `<b>zle -N</b>', and implemented as shell functions.  When the widget is executed, the corresponding shell function is executed, and can perform editing (or other) actions. It is recommended that user-defined widgets should not have names starting with ` <b>.</b>'.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>USER\-DEFINED WIDGETS</h1> User-defined widgets, being implemented as shell functions, can execute any normal shell command.  They can also run other widgets (whether built-in or user-defined) using the  <b>zle</b> builtin command. The standard input of the function is closed to prevent external commands from unintentionally blocking ZLE by reading from the terminal, but  <b>read -k</b> or <b>read -q</b> can be used to read characters.  Finally, they can examine and edit the ZLE buffer being edited by reading and setting the special parameters described below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These special parameters are always available in widget functions, but are not in any way special outside ZLE.  If they have some normal value outside ZLE, that value is temporarily inaccessible, but will return when the widget function exits.  These special parameters in fact have local scope, like parameters created in a function using  <b>local</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Inside completion widgets and traps called while ZLE is active, these parameters are available read-only.<div class="spacer">

<b>CURSOR</b> (integer)</dt>
<dd>
The offset of the cursor, within the edit buffer.  This is in the range 0 to  <b>$#BUFFER</b>, and is by definition equal to <b>$#LBUFFER</b>. Attempts to move the cursor outside the buffer will result in the cursor being moved to the appropriate end of the buffer.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>CUTBUFFER</b> (scalar)</dt>
<dd>
The last item cut using one of the `<b>kill-</b>' commands; the string which the next yank would insert in the line.  Later entries in the kill ring are in the array  <b>killring</b>.  Note that the command ` <b>zle copy-region-as-kill</b> <i>string</i>' can be used to set the text of the cut buffer from a shell function and cycle the kill ring in the same way as interactively killing text.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>HISTNO</b> (integer)</dt>
<dd>
The current history number.  Setting this has the same effect as moving up or down in the history to the corresponding history line. An attempt to set it is ignored if the line is not stored in the history.  Note this is not the same as the parameter  <b>HISTCMD</b>, which always gives the number of the history line being added to the main shell's history.   <b>HISTNO</b> refers to the line being retrieved within zle.</dd>

The default size for the kill ring is eight, however the length may be changed by normal array operations.

If it is unset inside a widget function, builtin widgets called behave as if no numeric argument was given.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PENDING</b> (integer)</dt>
<dd>
The number of bytes pending for input, i.e. the number of bytes which have already been typed and can immediately be read. On systems where the shell is not able to get this information, this parameter will always have a value of zero.  Read-only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PREBUFFER</b> (scalar)</dt>
<dd>
In a multi-line input at the secondary prompt, this read-only parameter contains the contents of the lines before the one the cursor is currently in.</dd>

A restricted set of editing functions is available in the mini-buffer.

An interrupt signal, as defined by the stty setting, will stop the search and go back to the original line.  An undefined key will have the same effect.

Insert the last word from the previous history event at the cursor position.  If a positive numeric argument is given, insert that word from the end of the previous history event. If the argument is zero or negative insert that word from the left (zero inserts the previous command word).  Repeating this command replaces the word just inserted with the last word from the history event prior to the one just used; numeric arguments can be used in the same way to pick a word from that event.</dd>

When called from a shell function invoked from a user-defined widget, the command can take one to three arguments.  The first argument specifies a history offset which applies to successive calls to this widget: if it is -1, the default behaviour is used, while if it is 1, successive calls will move forwards through the history.  The value 0 can be used to indicate that the history line examined by the previous execution of the command will be reexamined.  Note that negative numbers should be preceded by a ` <b>-</b><b>-</b>' argument to avoid confusing them with options.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If two arguments are given, the second specifies the word on the command line in normal array index notation (as a more natural alternative to the prefix argument).  Hence 1 is the first word, and -1 (the default) is the last word.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a third argument is given, its value is ignored, but it is used to signify that the history offset is relative to the current history line, rather than the one remembered after the previous invocations of  <b>insert-last-word</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, the default behaviour of the command corresponds to<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>zle insert-last-word -- -1 -1</b><br/>

<h2>Arguments</h2><dl>

</dt>
<dd>
<b>digit-argument</b> (ESC-0..ESC-9) (1-9) (unbound) Start a new numeric argument, or add to the current one. See also  <b>vi-digit-or-beginning-of-line</b>.  This only works if bound to a key sequence ending in a decimal digit.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Inside a widget function, a call to this function treats the last key of the key sequence which called the widget as the digit.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>neg-argument</b> (ESC--) (unbound) (unbound)</dt>
<dd>
Changes the sign of the following argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>universal-argument</b></dt>
<dd>
Multiply the argument of the next command by 4.  Alternatively, if this command is followed by an integer (positive or negative), use that as the argument for the next command.  Thus digits cannot be repeated using this command.  For example, if this command occurs twice, followed immediately by  <b>forward-char</b>, move forward sixteen spaces; if instead it is followed by  <b>-2</b>, then <b>forward-char</b>, move backward two spaces.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Inside a widget function, if passed an argument, i.e. `<b>zle</b>  <b>universal-argument</b> <i>num</i>', the numerical argument will be set to  <i>num</i>; this is equivalent to `<b>NUMERIC=</b><i>num</i>'.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>argument-base</b></dt>
<dd>
Use the existing numeric argument as a numeric base, which must be in the range 2 to 36 inclusive.  Subsequent use of  <b>digit-argument</b> and  <b>universal-argument</b> will input a new prefix in the given base. The usual hexadecimal convention is used: the letter  <b>a</b> or <b>A</b> corresponds to 10, and so on.  Arguments in bases requiring digits from 10 upwards are more conveniently input with  <b>universal-argument</b>, since  <b>ESC-a</b> etc. are not usually bound to <b>digit-argument</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

<b>read-command</b></dt>
<dd>
Only useful from a user-defined widget.  A keystroke is read just as in normal operation, but instead of the command being executed the name of the command that would be executed is stored in the shell parameter  <b>REPLY</b>.  This can be used as the argument of a future <b>zle</b> command.  If the key sequence is not bound, status 1 is returned; typically, however,  <b>REPLY</b> is set to <b>undefined-key</b> to indicate a useless key sequence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>recursive-edit</b></dt>
<dd>
Only useful from a user-defined widget.  At this point in the function, the editor regains control until one of the standard widgets which would normally cause zle to exit (typically an  <b>accept-line</b> caused by hitting the return key) is executed.  Instead, control returns to the user-defined widget.  The status returned is non-zero if the return was caused by an error, but the function still continues executing and hence may tidy up.  This makes it safe for the user-defined widget to alter the command line or key bindings temporarily.</dd>

This causes typed letters to be inserted capitalised until either  <b>accept-line</b> (i.e. typically the return key) is typed or the  <b>caps-lock</b> widget is invoked again; the later is handled by saving the old definition of  <b>caps-lock</b> as <b>save-caps-lock</b> and then rebinding it to invoke  <b>accept-line</b>.

The available types of highlighting are the following.  Note that not all types of highlighting are available on all terminals:<div class="spacer">
</div>

<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>none</b> No highlighting is applied to the given context.  It is not useful for this to appear with other types of highlighting; it is used to override a default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>fg=</b><i>colour</i></dt>
<dd>
The foreground colour should be set to <i>colour</i>, a decimal integer or the name of one of the eight most widely-supported colours.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Not all terminals support this and, of those that do, not all provide facilities to test the support, hence the user should decide based on the terminal type.  Most terminals support the colours  <b>black</b>, <b>red</b>,  <b>green</b>, <b>yellow</b>, <b>blue</b>, <b>magenta</b>, <b>cyan</b> and <b>white</b>, which can be set by name.  In addition.  <b>default</b> may be used to set the terminal's default foreground colour.  Abbreviations are allowed;  <b>b</b> or <b>bl</b> selects black.  Some terminals may generate additional colours if the  <b>bold</b> attribute is also present.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On recent terminals and on systems with an up-to-date terminal database the number of colours supported may be tested by the command ` <b>echotc</b>  <b>Co</b>'; if this succeeds, it indicates a limit on the number of colours which will be enforced by the line editor.  The number of colours is in any case limited to 256 (i.e. the range 0 to 255).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Colour is also known as color.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>bg=</b><i>colour</i></dt>
<dd>
The background colour should be set to <i>colour</i>. This works similarly to the foreground colour, except the background is not usually affected by the bold attribute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>bold</b></dt>
<dd>
The characters in the given context are shown in a bold font. Not all terminals distinguish bold fonts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>standout</b></dt>
<dd>
The characters in the given context are shown in the terminal's standout mode.  The actual effect is specific to the terminal; on many terminals it is inverse video.  On some such terminals, where the cursor does not blink it appears with standout mode negated, making it less than clear where the cursor actually is.  On such terminals one of the other effects may be preferable for highlighting the region and matched search string.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>underline</b></dt>
<dd>
The characters in the given context are shown underlined.  Some terminals show the foreground in a different colour instead; in this case whitespace will not be highlighted.</dd>

The characters described above as `special' are as follows.  The formatting described here is used irrespective of whether the characters are highlighted:<div class="spacer">

ASCII control characters Control characters in the ASCII range are shown as ` <b>^</b>' followed by the base character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Unprintable multibyte characters</dt>
<dd>
This item applies to control characters not in the ASCII range, plus other characters as follows.  If the  <b>MULTIBYTE</b> option is in effect, multibyte characters not in the ASCII character set that are reported as having zero width are treated as combining characters when the option  <b>COMBINING_CHARS</b> is on.  If the option is off, or if a character appears where a combining character is not valid, the character is treated as unprintable.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unprintable multibyte characters are shown as a hexadecimal number between angle brackets.  The number is the code point of the character in the wide character set; this may or may not be Unicode, depending on the operating system.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
Invalid multibyte characters</dt>
<dd>
If the <b>MULTIBYTE</b> option is in effect, any sequence of one or more bytes that does not form a valid character in the current character set is treated as a series of bytes each shown as a special character. This case can be distinguished from other unprintable characters as the bytes are represented as two hexadecimal digits between angle brackets, as distinct from the four or eight digits that are used for unprintable characters that are nonetheless valid in the current character set.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Not all systems support this: for it to work, the system's representation of wide characters must be code values from the Universal Character Set, as defined by IS0 10646 (also known as Unicode).</div>
<dl>
<dt>
Wrapped double-width characters</dt>
<dd>
When a double-width character appears in the final column of a line, it is instead shown on the next line. The empty space left in the original position is highlighted as a special character.</dd>
