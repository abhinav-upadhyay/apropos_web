<h1>NAME</h1> perlreftut - Mark's very short tutorial about references</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> One of the most important new features in Perl 5 was the capability to manage complicated data structures like multidimensional arrays and nested hashes.  To enable these, Perl 5 introduced a feature called `references', and using references is the key to managing complicated, structured data in Perl.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of funny syntax to learn, and the main manual page can be hard to follow.  The manual is quite complete, and sometimes people find that a problem, because it can be hard to tell what is important and what isn't.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Fortunately, you only need to know 10% of what's in the main page to get 90% of the benefit.  This page will show you that 10%.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Who Needs Complicated Data Structures?</h1> One problem that came up all the time in Perl 4 was how to represent a hash whose values were lists.  Perl 4 had hashes, of course, but the values had to be scalars; they couldn't be lists.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Why would you want a hash of lists?  Let's take a simple example: You have a file of city and country names, like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        Chicago, USA<br/>
        Frankfurt, Germany<br/>
        Berlin, Germany<br/>
        Washington, USA<br/>
        Helsinki, Finland<br/>
        New York, USA<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
and you want to produce an output like this, with each country mentioned once, and then an alphabetical list of the cities in that country:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        Finland: Helsinki.<br/>
        Germany: Berlin, Frankfurt.<br/>
        USA:  Chicago, New York, Washington.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The natural way to do this is to have a hash whose keys are country names.  Associated with each country name key is a list of the cities in that country.  Each time you read a line of input, split it into a country and a city, look up the list of cities already known to be in that country, and append the new city to the list.  When you're done reading the input, iterate over the hash as usual, sorting each list of cities before you print it out.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If hash values can't be lists, you lose.  In Perl 4, hash values can't be lists; they can only be strings.  You lose.  You'd probably have to combine all the cities into a single string somehow, and then when time came to write the output, you'd have to break the string into a list, sort the list, and turn it back into a string.  This is messy and error-prone.  And it's frustrating, because Perl already has perfectly good lists that would solve the problem if only you could use them.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>The Solution</h1> By the time Perl 5 rolled around, we were already stuck with this design: Hash values must be scalars.  The solution to this is references.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A reference is a scalar value that <i>refers to</i> an entire array or an entire hash (or to just about anything else).  Names are one kind of reference that you're already familiar with.  Think of the President of the United States: a messy, inconvenient bag of blood and bones. But to talk about him, or to represent him in a computer program, all you need is the easy, convenient scalar string &quot;Barack Obama&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
References in Perl are like names for arrays and hashes.  They're Perl's private, internal names, so you can be sure they're unambiguous.  Unlike &quot;Barack Obama&quot;, a reference only refers to one thing, and you always know what it refers to.  If you have a reference to an array, you can recover the entire array from it.  If you have a reference to a hash, you can recover the entire hash.  But the reference is still an easy, compact scalar value.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can't have a hash whose values are arrays; hash values can only be scalars.  We're stuck with that.  But a single reference can refer to an entire array, and references are scalars, so you can have a hash of references to arrays, and it'll act a lot like a hash of arrays, and it'll be just as useful as a hash of arrays.<div class="spacer">
</div>
We'll come back to this city-country problem later, after we've seen some syntax for managing references.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Syntax</h1> There are just two ways to make a reference, and just two ways to use it once you have it.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Making References</h2>  <i></i><b><i>Make Rule 1</i></b><i></i><div class="spacer">
</div>
If you put a &quot;\&quot; in front of a variable, you get a reference to that variable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $aref = \@array;         # $aref now holds a reference to @array<br/>
    $href = \%hash;          # $href now holds a reference to %hash<br/>
    $sref = \$scalar;        # $sref now holds a reference to $scalar<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Once the reference is stored in a variable like $aref or $href, you can copy it or store it just the same as any other scalar value:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $xy = $aref;             # $xy now holds a reference to @array<br/>
    $p[3] = $href;           # $p[3] now holds a reference to %hash<br/>
    $z = $p[3];              # $z now holds a reference to %hash<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
These examples show how to make references to variables with names. Sometimes you want to make an array or a hash that doesn't have a name.  This is analogous to the way you like to be able to use the string &quot;\n&quot; or the number 80 without having to store it in a named variable first.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Make Rule 2</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;[ ITEMS ]&quot; makes a new, anonymous array, and returns a reference to that array.  &quot;{ ITEMS }&quot; makes a new, anonymous hash, and returns a reference to that hash.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    $aref = [ 1, &quot;foo&quot;, undef, 13 ];<br/>
    # $aref now holds a reference to an array<br/>
<br/>
    $href = { APR =&gt; 4, AUG =&gt; 8 };<br/>
    # $href now holds a reference to a hash<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The references you get from rule 2 are the same kind of references that you get from rule 1:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        # This:<br/>
        $aref = [ 1, 2, 3 ];<br/>
<br/>
        # Does the same as this:<br/>
        @array = (1, 2, 3);<br/>
        $aref = \@array;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first line is an abbreviation for the following two lines, except that it doesn't create the superfluous array variable @array.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you write just &quot;[]&quot;, you get a new, empty anonymous array. If you write just &quot;{}&quot;, you get a new, empty anonymous hash.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Using References</h2> What can you do with a reference once you have it?  It's a scalar value, and we've seen that you can store it as a scalar and get it back again just like any scalar.  There are just two more ways to use it:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><b><i>Use Rule 1</i></b><i></i><div class="spacer">
</div>
You can always use an array reference, in curly braces, in place of the name of an array.  For example, &quot;@{$aref}&quot; instead of @array.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here are some examples of that:<div class="spacer">
</div>
Arrays:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        @a              @{$aref}                An array<br/>
        reverse @a      reverse @{$aref}        Reverse the array<br/>
        $a[3]           ${$aref}[3]             An element of the array<br/>
        $a[3] = 17;     ${$aref}[3] = 17        Assigning an element<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
On each line are two expressions that do the same thing.  The left-hand versions operate on the array @a.  The right-hand versions operate on the array that is referred to by $aref.  Once they find the array they're operating on, both versions do the same things to the arrays.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Using a hash reference is <i>exactly</i> the same:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        %h              %{$href}              A hash<br/>
        keys %h         keys %{$href}         Get the keys from the hash<br/>
        $h{'red'}       ${$href}{'red'}       An element of the hash<br/>
        $h{'red'} = 17  ${$href}{'red'} = 17  Assigning an element<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Whatever you want to do with a reference, <b>Use Rule 1</b> tells you how to do it.  You just write the Perl code that you would have written for doing the same thing to a regular array or hash, and then replace the array or hash name with &quot;{$reference}&quot;.  &quot;How do I loop over an array when all I have is a reference?&quot;  Well, to loop over an array, you would write<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        for my $element (@array) {<br/>
           ...<br/>
        }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
so replace the array name, @array, with the reference:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        for my $element (@{$aref}) {<br/>
           ...<br/>
        }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;How do I print out the contents of a hash when all I have is a reference?&quot;  First write the code for printing out a hash:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        for my $key (keys %hash) {<br/>
          print &quot;$key =&gt; $hash{$key}\n&quot;;<br/>
        }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And then replace the hash name with the reference:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        for my $key (keys %{$href}) {<br/>
          print &quot;$key =&gt; ${$href}{$key}\n&quot;;<br/>
        }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i></i><b><i>Use Rule 2</i></b><i></i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Use Rule 1</b> is all you really need, because it tells you how to do absolutely everything you ever need to do with references.  But the most common thing to do with an array or a hash is to extract a single element, and the  <b>Use Rule 1</b> notation is cumbersome.  So there is an abbreviation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;${$aref}[3]&quot; is too hard to read, so you can write &quot;$aref-&gt;[3]&quot; instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;${$href}{red}&quot; is too hard to read, so you can write &quot;$href-&gt;{red}&quot; instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If $aref holds a reference to an array, then &quot;$aref-&gt;[3]&quot; is the fourth element of the array.  Don't confuse this with $aref[3], which is the fourth element of a totally different array, one deceptively named @aref.  $aref and @aref are unrelated the same way that $item and @item are.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Similarly, &quot;$href-&gt;{'red'}&quot; is part of the hash referred to by the scalar variable $href, perhaps even one with no name. $href{'red'} is part of the deceptively named %href hash.  It's easy to forget to leave out the &quot;-&gt;&quot;, and if you do, you'll get bizarre results when your program gets array and hash elements out of totally unexpected hashes and arrays that weren't the ones you wanted to use.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>An Example</h2> Let's see a quick example of how all this is useful.<div class="spacer">
</div>
First, remember that &quot;[1, 2, 3]&quot; makes an anonymous array containing &quot;(1, 2, 3)&quot;, and gives you a reference to that array.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now think about<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        @a = ( [1, 2, 3],<br/>
               [4, 5, 6],<br/>
               [7, 8, 9]<br/>
             );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
@a is an array with three elements, and each one is a reference to another array.<div class="spacer">
</div>
$a[1] is one of these references.  It refers to an array, the array containing &quot;(4, 5, 6)&quot;, and because it is a reference to an array,  <b>Use Rule 2</b> says that we can write $a[1]-&gt;[2] to get the third element from that array.  $a[1]-&gt;[2] is the 6. Similarly, $a[0]-&gt;[1] is the 2.  What we have here is like a two-dimensional array; you can write $a[ROW]-&gt;[COLUMN] to get or set the element in any row and any column of the array.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The notation still looks a little cumbersome, so there's one more abbreviation:</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Arrow Rule</h2> In between two  <b>subscripts</b>, the arrow is optional.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Instead of $a[1]-&gt;[2], we can write $a[1][2]; it means the same thing.  Instead of &quot;$a[0]-&gt;[1] = 23&quot;, we can write &quot;$a[0][1] = 23&quot;; it means the same thing.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now it really looks like two-dimensional arrays!<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can see why the arrows are important.  Without them, we would have had to write &quot;${$a[1]}[2]&quot; instead of $a[1][2].  For three-dimensional arrays, they let us write $x[2][3][5] instead of the unreadable &quot;${${$x[2]}[3]}[5]&quot;.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Solution</h1> Here's the answer to the problem I posed earlier, of reformatting a file of city and country names.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    1   my %table;<br/>
<br/>
    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {<br/>
    3    chomp;<br/>
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;<br/>
    5     $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};<br/>
    6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;<br/>
    7   }<br/>
<br/>
    8   foreach $country (sort keys %table) {<br/>
    9     print &quot;$country: &quot;;<br/>
   10     my @cities = @{$table{$country}};<br/>
   11     print join ', ', sort @cities;<br/>
   12     print &quot;.\n&quot;;<br/>
   13   }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The program has two pieces: Lines 2--7 read the input and build a data structure, and lines 8-13 analyze the data and print out the report. We're going to have a hash, %table, whose keys are country names, and whose values are references to arrays of city names.  The data structure will look like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
           %table<br/>
        +-------+---+<br/>
        |       |   |   +-----------+--------+<br/>
        |Germany| *----&gt;| Frankfurt | Berlin |<br/>
        |       |   |   +-----------+--------+<br/>
        +-------+---+<br/>
        |       |   |   +----------+<br/>
        |Finland| *----&gt;| Helsinki |<br/>
        |       |   |   +----------+<br/>
        +-------+---+<br/>
        |       |   |   +---------+------------+----------+<br/>
        |  USA  | *----&gt;| Chicago | Washington | New York |<br/>
        |       |   |   +---------+------------+----------+<br/>
        +-------+---+<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
We'll look at output first.  Supposing we already have this structure, how do we print it out?<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    8   foreach $country (sort keys %table) {<br/>
    9     print &quot;$country: &quot;;<br/>
   10     my @cities = @{$table{$country}};<br/>
   11     print join ', ', sort @cities;<br/>
   12     print &quot;.\n&quot;;<br/>
   13   }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
%table is an ordinary hash, and we get a list of keys from it, sort the keys, and loop over the keys as usual.  The only use of references is in line 10. $table{$country} looks up the key $country in the hash and gets the value, which is a reference to an array of cities in that country.  <b>Use Rule 1</b> says that we can recover the array by saying &quot;@{$table{$country}}&quot;.  Line 10 is just like<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        @cities = @array;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
except that the name &quot;array&quot; has been replaced by the reference &quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;.  The &quot;@&quot; tells Perl to get the entire array. Having gotten the list of cities, we sort it, join it, and print it out as usual.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Lines 2-7 are responsible for building the structure in the first place.  Here they are again:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {<br/>
    3    chomp;<br/>
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;<br/>
    5     $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};<br/>
    6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;<br/>
    7   }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Lines 2-4 acquire a city and country name.  Line 5 looks to see if the country is already present as a key in the hash.  If it's not, the program uses the &quot;[]&quot; notation ( <b>Make Rule 2</b>) to manufacture a new, empty anonymous array of cities, and installs a reference to it into the hash under the appropriate key.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Line 6 installs the city name into the appropriate array. $table{$country} now holds a reference to the array of cities seen in that country so far.  Line 6 is exactly like<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        push @array, $city;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
except that the name &quot;array&quot; has been replaced by the reference &quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;.  The &quot;push&quot; adds a city name to the end of the referred-to array.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There's one fine point I skipped.  Line 5 is unnecessary, and we can get rid of it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {<br/>
    3    chomp;<br/>
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;<br/>
    5   ####  $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};<br/>
    6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;<br/>
    7   }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If there's already an entry in %table for the current $country, then nothing is different.  Line 6 will locate the value in $table{$country}, which is a reference to an array, and push $city into the array.  But what does it do when $country holds a key, say &quot;Greece&quot;, that is not yet in %table?<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is Perl, so it does the exact right thing.  It sees that you want to push &quot;Athens&quot; onto an array that doesn't exist, so it helpfully makes a new, empty, anonymous array for you, installs it into %table, and then pushes &quot;Athens&quot; onto it.  This is called `autovivification'--bringing things to life automatically.  Perl saw that they key wasn't in the hash, so it created a new hash entry automatically. Perl saw that you wanted to use the hash value as an array, so it created a new empty array and installed a reference to it in the hash automatically.  And as usual, Perl made the array one element longer to hold the new city name.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>The Rest</h1> I promised to give you 90% of the benefit with 10% of the details, and that means I left out 90% of the details.  Now that you have an overview of the important parts, it should be easier to read the perlref manual page, which discusses 100% of the details.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some of the highlights of perlref:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
You can make references to anything, including scalars, functions, and other references.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In <b>Use Rule 1</b>, you can omit the curly brackets whenever the thing inside them is an atomic scalar variable like $aref.  For example, @$aref is the same as &quot;@{$aref}&quot;, and $$aref[1] is the same as &quot;${$aref}[1]&quot;.  If you're just starting out, you may want to adopt the habit of always including the curly brackets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
This doesn't copy the underlying array:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        $aref2 = $aref1;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You get two references to the same array.  If you modify &quot;$aref1-&gt;[23]&quot; and then look at &quot;$aref2-&gt;[23]&quot; you'll see the change.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
To copy the array, use<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        $aref2 = [@{$aref1}];<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This uses &quot;[...]&quot; notation to create a new anonymous array, and $aref2 is assigned a reference to the new array.  The new array is initialized with the contents of the array referred to by $aref1.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Similarly, to copy an anonymous hash, you can use<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        $href2 = {%{$href1}};<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
To see if a variable contains a reference, use the &quot;ref&quot; function.  It returns true if its argument is a reference.  Actually it's a little better than that: It returns &quot;HASH&quot; for hash references and &quot;ARRAY&quot; for array references.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
If you try to use a reference like a string, you get strings like<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        ARRAY(0x80f5dec)   or    HASH(0x826afc0)<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you ever see a string that looks like this, you'll know you printed out a reference by mistake.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A side effect of this representation is that you can use &quot;eq&quot; to see if two references refer to the same thing.  (But you should usually use &quot;==&quot; instead because it's much faster.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
You can use a string as if it were a reference.  If you use the string &quot;foo&quot; as an array reference, it's taken to be a reference to the array @foo.  This is called a  <i>soft reference</i> or <i>symbolic</i>  <i>reference</i>.  The declaration &quot;use strict 'refs'&quot; disables this feature, which can cause all sorts of trouble if you use it by accident.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You might prefer to go on to perllol instead of perlref; it discusses lists of lists and multidimensional arrays in detail.  After that, you should move on to perldsc; it's a Data Structure Cookbook that shows recipes for using and printing out arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, and other kinds of data.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Summary</h1> Everyone needs compound data structures, and in Perl the way you get them is with references.  There are four important rules for managing references: Two for making references and two for using them.  Once you know these rules you can do most of the important things you need to do with references.</div>
