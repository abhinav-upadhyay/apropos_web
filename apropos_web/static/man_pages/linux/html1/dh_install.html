<h1>NAME</h1> dh_install - install files into package build directories</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>  <b>dh_install</b> [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>] [<b>--autodest</b>] [<b>--sourcedir=</b><i>dir</i>] [<i>debhelper&#160;options</i>] [<i>file</i>&#160;...&#160;<i>dest</i>]</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <b>dh_install</b> is a debhelper program that handles installing files into package build directories. There are many  <b>dh_install</b><i>*</i> commands that handle installing specific types of files such as documentation, examples, man pages, and so on, and they should be used when possible as they often have extra intelligence for those particular tasks.  <b>dh_install</b>, then, is useful for installing everything else, for which no particular intelligence is needed. It is a replacement for the old  <b>dh_movefiles</b> command.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This program may be used in one of two ways. If you just have a file or two that the upstream Makefile does not install for you, you can run  <b>dh_install</b> on them to move them into place. On the other hand, maybe you have a large package that builds multiple binary packages. You can use the upstream  <i>Makefile</i> to install it all into <i>debian/tmp</i>, and then use <b>dh_install</b> to copy directories and files from there into the proper package build directories.<div class="spacer">
</div>
From debhelper compatibility level 7 on, <b>dh_install</b> will fall back to looking in  <i>debian/tmp</i> for files, if it doesn't find them in the current directory (or whereever you've told it to look using  <b>--sourcedir</b>).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FILES</h1><dl>
<dt>
debian/<i>package</i>.install</dt>
<dd>
List the files to install into each package and the directory they should be installed to. The format is a set of lines, where each line lists a file or files to install, and at the end of the line tells the directory it should be installed in. The name of the files (or directories) to install should be given relative to the current directory, while the installation directory is given relative to the package build directory. You may use wildcards in the names of the files to install (in v3 mode and above).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>--list-missing</b></dt>
<dd>
This option makes <b>dh_install</b> keep track of the files it installs, and then at the end, compare that list with the files in the source directory. If any of the files (and symlinks) in the source directory were not installed to somewhere, it will warn on stderr about that.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This may be useful if you have a large package and want to make sure that you don't miss installing newly added files in new upstream releases.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that files that are excluded from being moved via the <b>-X</b> option are not warned about.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--fail-missing</b></dt>
<dd>
This option is like <b>--list-missing</b>, except if a file was missed, it will not only list the missing files, but also fail with a nonzero exit code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-X</b><i>item</i>, <b>--exclude=</b><i>item</i></dt>
<dd>
Exclude files that contain <i>item</i> anywhere in their filename from being installed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--sourcedir=</b><i>dir</i></dt>
<dd>
Look in the specified directory for files to be installed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that this is not the same as the <b>--sourcedirectory</b> option used by the  <b>dh_auto_</b><i>*</i> commands. You rarely need to use this option, since  <b>dh_install</b> automatically looks for files in <i>debian/tmp</i> in debhelper compatibility level 7 and above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--autodest</b></dt>
<dd>
Guess as the destination directory to install things to. If this is specified, you should not list destination directories in  <i>debian/package.install</i> files or on the command line. Instead, <b>dh_install</b> will guess as follows:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Strip off <i>debian/tmp</i> (or the sourcedir if one is given) from the front of the filename, if it is present, and install into the dirname of the filename. So if the filename is  <i>debian/tmp/usr/bin</i>, then that directory will be copied to  <i>debian/package/usr/</i>. If the filename is  <i>debian/tmp/etc/passwd</i>, it will be copied to <i>debian/package/etc/</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that if you list exactly one filename or wildcard-pattern on a line by itself in a  <i>debian/package.install</i> file, with no explicit destination, then <b>dh_install</b> will automatically guess the destination even if this flag is not set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>file</i> ... <i>dest</i></dt>
<dd>
Lists files (or directories) to install and where to install them to. The files will be installed into the first package  <i>dh_install</i> acts on.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>  <b>dh_install</b> cannot rename files or directories, it can only install them with the names they already have into wherever you want in the package build tree.</div>
