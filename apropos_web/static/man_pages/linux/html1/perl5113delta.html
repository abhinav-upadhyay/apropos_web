<h1>NAME</h1> perl5113delta - what is new for perl v5.11.3</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.11.2 release and the 5.11.3 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.11.1, first read the perl5112delta, which describes differences between 5.11.1 and 5.11.2</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Filehandles are blessed directly into &quot;IO::Handle&quot;, as &quot;FileHandle&quot; is merely a wrapper around &quot;IO::Handle&quot;.</h2> The previous behaviour was to bless Filehandles into FileHandle (an empty proxy class) if it was loaded into memory and otherwise to bless them into &quot;IO::Handle&quot;.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode version</h2> Perl is shipped with the latest Unicode version, 5.2, dated October 2009.  See &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0&gt; for details about this release of Unicode.  See perlunicode for instructions on installing and using older versions of Unicode.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode properties</h2> Perl can now handle every Unicode character property.  A new pod, perluniprops, lists all available non-Unihan character properties.  By default the Unihan properties and certain others (deprecated and Unicode internal-only ones) are not exposed.  See below for more details on these; there is also a section in the pod listing them, and why they are not exposed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl now fully supports the Unicode compound-style of using &quot;=&quot; and &quot;:&quot; in writing regular expressions: &quot;\p{property=value}&quot; and &quot;\p{property:value}&quot; (both of which mean the same thing).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl now fully supports the Unicode loose matching rules for text between the braces in &quot;\p{...}&quot; constructs.  In addition, Perl also allows underscores between digits of numbers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All the Unicode-defined synonyms for properties and property values are now accepted.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;qr/\X/&quot;, which matches a Unicode logical character, has been expanded to work better with various Asian languages.  It now is defined as an &quot;extended grapheme cluster&quot;.  (See &lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/&gt;). Anything matched previously that made sense will continue to be matched.  But in addition:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\X&quot; will now not break apart a &quot;CR&#160;LF&quot; sequence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\X&quot; will now match a sequence including the &quot;ZWJ&quot; and &quot;ZWNJ&quot; characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\X&quot; will now always match at least one character, including an initial mark. Marks generally come after a base character, but it is possible in Unicode to have them in isolation, and &quot;\X&quot; will now handle that case, for example at the beginning of a line or after a &quot;ZWSP&quot;.  And this is the part where &quot;\X&quot; doesn't match the things that it used to that don't make sense.  Formerly, for example, you could have the nonsensical case of an accented LF.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;\X&quot; will now match a (Korean) Hangul syllable sequence, and the Thai and Lao exception cases.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Otherwise, this change should be transparent for the non-affected languages.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{...}&quot; matches using the Canonical_Combining_Class property were completely broken in previous Perls.  This is now fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In previous Perls, the Unicode &quot;Decomposition_Type=Compat&quot; property and a Perl extension had the same name, which led to neither matching all the correct values (with more than 100 mistakes in one, and several thousand in the other).  The Perl extension has now been renamed to be &quot;Decomposition_Type=Noncanonical&quot; (short: &quot;dt=noncanon&quot;).  It has the same meaning as was previously intended, namely the union of all the non-canonical Decomposition types, with Unicode &quot;Compat&quot; being just one of those.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Uppercase}&quot; and &quot;\p{Lowercase}&quot; have been brought into line with the Unicode definitions.  This means they each match a few more characters than previously.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Cntrl}&quot; now matches the same characters as &quot;\p{Control}&quot;.  This means it no longer will match Private Use (gc=co), Surrogates (gc=cs), nor Format (gc=cf) code points.  The Format code points represent the biggest possible problem.  All but 36 of them are either officially deprecated or strongly discouraged from being used.  Of those 36, likely the most widely used are the soft hyphen (U+00AD), and BOM, ZWSP, ZWNJ, WJ, and similar, plus Bi-directional controls.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Alpha}&quot; now matches the same characters as &quot;\p{Alphabetic}&quot;.  The Perl definition included a number of things that aren't really alpha (all marks), while omitting many that were.  As a direct consequence, the definitions of &quot;\p{Alnum}&quot; and &quot;\p{Word}&quot; which depend on Alpha also change.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Word}&quot; also now doesn't match certain characters it wasn't supposed to, such as fractions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Print}&quot; no longer matches the line control characters: Tab, LF, CR, FF, VT, and NEL.  This brings it in line with the documentation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;\p{Decomposition_Type=Canonical}&quot; now includes the Hangul syllables.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Numeric type property has been extended to include the Unihan characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is a new Perl extension, the 'Present_In', or simply 'In', property.  This is an extension of the Unicode Age property, but &quot;\p{In=5.0}&quot; matches any code point whose usage has been determined  <i>as of</i> Unicode version 5.0.  The &quot;\p{Age=5.0}&quot; only matches code points added in  <i>precisely</i> version 5.0.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A number of properties did not have the correct values for unassigned code points.  This is now fixed.  The affected properties are Bidi_Class, East_Asian_Width, Joining_Type, Decomposition_Type, Hangul_Syllable_Type, Numeric_Type, and Line_Break.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, ID_Continue, and ID_Start properties have been updated to their current Unicode definitions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Certain properties that are supposed to be Unicode internal-only were erroneously exposed by previous Perls.  Use of these in regular expressions will now generate, if enabled, a deprecated warning message. The properties are: Other_Alphabetic, Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, Other_Grapheme_Extend, Other_ID_Continue, Other_ID_Start, Other_Lowercase, Other_Math, and Other_Uppercase.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An installation can now fairly easily change which Unicode properties Perl understands.  As mentioned above, certain properties are by default turned off.  These include all the Unihan properties (which should be accessible via the CPAN module Unicode::Unihan) and any deprecated or Unicode internal-only property that Perl has never exposed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The generated files in the &quot;lib/unicore/To&quot; directory are now more clearly marked as being stable, directly usable by applications. New hash entries in them give the format of the normal entries, which allows for easier machine parsing.  Perl can generate files in this directory for any property, though most are suppressed.  An installation can choose to change which get written.  Instructions are in perluniprops.</div>

<h1>Changes to Existing Documentation</h1> The Pod specification (perlpodspec) has been updated to bring the specification in line with modern usage already supported by most Pod systems. A parameter string may now follow the format name in a &quot;begin/end&quot; region. Links to URIs with a text description are now allowed.

Always add a manifest resource to &quot;perl.exe&quot; to specify the &quot;trustInfo&quot; settings for Windows Vista and later.  Without this setting Windows will treat &quot;perl.exe&quot; as a legacy application and apply various heuristics like redirecting access to protected file system areas (like the &quot;Program Files&quot; folder) to the users &quot;VirtualStore&quot; instead of generating a proper &quot;permission denied&quot; error.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For VC8 and VC9 this manifest setting is automatically generated by the compiler/linker (together with the binding information for their respective runtime libraries); for all other compilers we need to embed the manifest resource explicitly in the external resource file.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This change also requests the Microsoft Common-Controls version 6.0 (themed controls introduced in Windows XP) via the dependency list in the assembly manifest.  For VC8 and VC9 this is specified using the &quot;/manifestdependency&quot; linker commandline option instead.</dd>

<h1>Selected Bug Fixes</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Ensure that pp_qr returns a new regexp SV each time. Resolves RT #69852.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Instead of returning a(nother) reference to the (pre-compiled) regexp in the optree, use  <i>reg_temp_copy()</i> to create a copy of it, and return a reference to that. This resolves issues about Regexp::DESTROY not being called in a timely fashion (the original bug tracked by RT #69852), as well as bugs related to blessing regexps, and of assigning to regexps, as described in correspondence added to the ticket.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It transpires that we also need to undo the <i>SvPVX()</i> sharing when ithreads cloning a Regexp SV, because mother_re is set to NULL, instead of a cloned copy of the mother_re. This change might fix bugs with regexps and threads in certain other situations, but as yet neither tests nor bug reports have indicated any problems, so it might not actually be an edge case that it's possible to reach.</dd>
