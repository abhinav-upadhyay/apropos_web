<h1>NAME</h1> perlplan9 - Plan 9-specific documentation for Perl</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> These are a few notes describing features peculiar to Plan 9 Perl. As such, it is not intended to be a replacement for the rest of the Perl 5 documentation (which is both copious and excellent). If you have any questions to which you can't find answers in these man pages, contact Luther Huffman at lutherh@stratcom.com and we'll try to answer them.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Invoking Perl</h2> Perl is invoked from the command line as described in perl. Most perl scripts, however, do have a first line such as &quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot;. This is known as a shebang (shell-bang) statement and tells the OS shell where to find the perl interpreter. In Plan 9 Perl this statement should be &quot;#!/bin/perl&quot; if you wish to be able to directly invoke the script by its name.<br/>
     Alternatively, you may invoke perl with the command &quot;Perl&quot; instead of &quot;perl&quot;. This will produce Acme-friendly error messages of the form &quot;filename:18&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some scripts, usually identified with a *.PL extension, are self-configuring and are able to correctly create their own shebang path from config information located in Plan 9 Perl. These you won't need to be worried about.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>What's in Plan 9 Perl</h2> Although Plan 9 Perl currently only  provides static loading, it is built with a number of useful extensions. These include Opcode, FileHandle, Fcntl, and POSIX. Expect to see others (and DynaLoading!) in the future.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>What's not in Plan 9 Perl</h2> As mentioned previously, dynamic loading isn't currently available nor is MakeMaker. Both are high-priority items.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Perl5 Functions not currently supported in Plan 9 Perl</h2> Some, such as &quot;chown&quot; and &quot;umask&quot; aren't provided because the concept does not exist within Plan 9. Others, such as some of the socket-related functions, simply haven't been written yet. Many in the latter category may be supported in the future.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The functions not currently implemented include:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    chown, chroot, dbmclose, dbmopen, getsockopt, <br/>
    setsockopt, recvmsg, sendmsg, getnetbyname, <br/>
    getnetbyaddr, getnetent, getprotoent, getservent, <br/>
    sethostent, setnetent, setprotoent, setservent, <br/>
    endservent, endnetent, endprotoent, umask<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There may be several other functions that have undefined behavior so this list shouldn't be considered complete.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Signals in Plan 9 Perl</h2> For compatibility with perl scripts written for the Unix environment, Plan 9 Perl uses the POSIX signal emulation provided in Plan 9's ANSI POSIX Environment (APE). Signal stacking isn't supported. The signals provided are:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGILL, SIGABRT,<br/>
    SIGFPE, SIGKILL, SIGSEGV, SIGPIPE, SIGPIPE, SIGALRM, <br/>
    SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, SIGCHLD, SIGCONT,<br/>
    SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU<br/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>COMPILING AND INSTALLING PERL ON PLAN 9</h1> WELCOME to Plan 9 Perl, brave soul!<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
   This is a preliminary alpha version of Plan 9 Perl. Still to be<br/>
implemented are MakeMaker and DynaLoader. Many perl commands are<br/>
missing or currently behave in an inscrutable manner. These gaps will,<br/>
with perseverance and a modicum of luck, be remedied in the near<br/>
future.To install this software:<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
1. Create the source directories and libraries for perl by running the plan9/setup.rc command (i.e., located in the plan9 subdirectory). Note: the setup routine assumes that you haven't dearchived these files into /sys/src/cmd/perl. After running setup.rc you may delete the copy of the source you originally detarred, as source code has now been installed in /sys/src/cmd/perl. If you plan on installing perl binaries for all architectures, run &quot;setup.rc -a&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
2. After making sure that you have adequate privileges to build system software, from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version appropriately) run:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        mk install<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you wish to install perl versions for all architectures (68020, mips, sparc and 386) run:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        mk installall<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
3. Wait. The build process will take a *long* time because perl bootstraps itself. A 75MHz Pentium, 16MB RAM machine takes roughly 30 minutes to build the distribution from scratch.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Installing Perl Documentation on Plan 9</h2> This perl distribution comes with a tremendous amount of documentation. To add these to the built-in manuals that come with Plan 9, from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version appropriately) run:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        mk man<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To begin your reading, start with:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        man perl<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is a good introduction and will direct you towards other man pages that may interest you.<div class="spacer">
</div>
(Note: &quot;mk man&quot; may produce some extraneous noise. Fear not.)</div>
