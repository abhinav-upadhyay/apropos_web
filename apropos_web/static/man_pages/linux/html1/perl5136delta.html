<h1>NAME</h1> perl5136delta - what is new for perl v5.13.6</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.13.5 release and the 5.13.6 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.13.4, first read perl5135delta, which describes differences between 5.13.4 and 5.13.5.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;(?^...)&quot; regex construct added to signify default modifiers</h2> A caret (also called a &quot;circumflex accent&quot;) &quot;^&quot; immediately following a &quot;(?&quot; in a regular expression now means that the subexpression is to not inherit the surrounding modifiers such as &quot;/i&quot;, but to revert to the Perl defaults.  Any modifiers following the caret override the defaults.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The stringification of regular expressions now uses this notation.  E.g., before, &quot;qr/hlagh/i&quot; would be stringified as &quot;(?i-xsm:hlagh)&quot;, but now it's stringified as &quot;(?^i:hlagh)&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The main purpose of this is to allow tests that rely on the stringification to not have to change when new modifiers are added. See &quot;Extended Patterns&quot; in perlre.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;d&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, and &quot;u&quot; regex modifiers added</h2> These modifiers are currently only available within a &quot;(?...)&quot; construct.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;l&quot; modifier says to compile the regular expression as if it were in the scope of &quot;use locale&quot;, even if it is not.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;u&quot; modifier says to compile the regular expression as if it were in the scope of a &quot;use feature &quot;unicode_strings&quot;&quot; pragma.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;d&quot; modifier is used to override any &quot;use locale&quot; and &quot;use feature &quot;unicode_strings&quot;&quot; pragmas that are in effect at the time of compiling the regular expression.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See just below and &quot;(?dlupimsx-imsx)&quot; in perlre.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;use feature &quot;unicode_strings&quot;&quot; now applies to some regex matching</h2> Another chunk of the &quot;The &quot;Unicode Bug&quot;&quot; in perlunicode is fixed in this release.  Now, regular expressions compiled within the scope of the &quot;unicode_strings&quot; feature will match the same whether or not the target string is encoded in utf8, with regard to &quot;\s&quot;, &quot;\w&quot;, &quot;\b&quot;, and their complements.  Work is underway to add the &quot;[[:posix:]]&quot; character classes and case sensitive matching to the control of this feature, but was not complete in time for this dot release.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;\N{...}&quot; now handles Unicode named character sequences</h2> Unicode has a number of named character sequences, in which particular sequences of code points are given names.  &quot;\N{...}&quot; now recognizes these. See charnames.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>New function &quot;charnames::string_vianame()&quot;</h2> This function is a run-time version of &quot;\N{...}&quot;, returning the string of characters whose Unicode name is its parameter.  It can handle Unicode named character sequences, whereas the pre-existing &quot;charnames::vianame()&quot; cannot, as the latter returns a single code point. See charnames.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Reentrant regular expression engine</h2> It is now safe to use regular expressions within &quot;(?{...})&quot; and &quot;(??{...})&quot; code blocks inside regular expressions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These block are still experimental, however, and still have problems with lexical (&quot;my&quot;) variables, lexical pragmata and abnormal exiting.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Custom per-subroutine check hooks</h2> XS code in an extension module can now annotate a subroutine (whether implemented in XS or in Perl) so that nominated XS code will be called at compile time (specifically as part of op checking) to change the op tree of that subroutine.  The compile-time check function (supplied by the extension module) can implement argument processing that can't be expressed as a prototype, generate customised compile-time warnings, perform constant folding for a pure function, inline a subroutine consisting of sufficiently simple ops, replace the whole call with a custom op, and so on.  This was previously all possible by hooking the &quot;entersub&quot; op checker, but the new mechanism makes it easy to tie the hook to a specific subroutine.  See &quot;cv_set_call_checker&quot; in perlapi.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To help in writing custom check hooks, several subtasks within standard &quot;entersub&quot; op checking have been separated out and exposed in the API.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Return value of &quot;delete $+{...}&quot;</h2> Custom regular expression engines can now determine the return value of &quot;delete&quot; on an entry of &quot;%+&quot; or &quot;%-&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;keys&quot;, &quot;values&quot; work on arrays</h2> You can now use the &quot;keys&quot;, &quot;values&quot;, &quot;each&quot; builtin functions on arrays (previously you could only use them on hashes).  See perlfunc for details. This is actually a change introduced in perl 5.12.0, but it was missed from that release's perldelta.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Stringification of regexes has changed</h2> Default regular expression modifiers are now notated by using &quot;(?^...)&quot;.  Code relying on the old stringification will fail.  The purpose of this is so that when new modifiers are added, such code will not have to change (after this one time), as the stringification will automatically incorporate the new modifiers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Code that needs to work properly with both old- and new-style regexes can avoid the whole issue by using (for Perls since 5.9.5):<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
 use re qw(regexp_pattern);<br/>
 my ($pat, $mods) = regexp_pattern($re_ref);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
where $re_ref is a reference to a compiled regular expression.  Upon return, $mods will be a string containing all the non-default modifiers used when the regular expression was compiled, and $pattern the actual pattern.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the actual stringification is important, or older Perls need to be supported, you can use something like the following:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    # Accept both old and new-style stringification<br/>
    my $modifiers = (qr/foobar/ =~ /\Q(?^/) ? '^' : '-xism';<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And then use $modifiers instead of &quot;-xism&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Regular expressions retain their localeness when interpolated</h2> Regular expressions compiled under &quot;use locale&quot; now retain this when interpolated into a new regular expression compiled outside a &quot;use locale&quot;, and vice-versa.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Previously, a regular expression interpolated into another one inherited the localeness of the surrounding one, losing whatever state it originally had.  This is considered a bug fix, but may trip up code that has come to rely on the incorrect behavior.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Directory handles not copied to threads</h2> On systems that do not have a &quot;fchdir&quot; function, newly-created threads no longer inherit directory handles from their parent threads. Such programs would probably have crashed anyway [perl #75154] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75154&gt;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Negation treats strings differently from before</h2> The unary negation operator &quot;-&quot; now treats strings that look like numbers as numbers [perl #57706] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=57706&gt;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Negative zero</h2> Negative zero (-0.0), when converted to a string, now becomes &quot;0&quot; on all platforms. It used to become &quot;-0&quot; on some, but &quot;0&quot; on others.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you still need to determine whether a zero is negative, use &quot;sprintf(&quot;%g&quot;, $zero) =~ /^-/&quot; or the Data::Float module on CPAN.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Performance Enhancements</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The bulk of the &quot;Tie::Hash::NamedCapture&quot; module used to be in the perl core. It has now been moved to an XS module, to reduce the overhead for programs that do not use &quot;%+&quot; or &quot;%-&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Eliminate &quot;PL_*&quot; accessor functions under ithreads.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
When &quot;MULTIPLICITY&quot; was first developed, and interpreter state moved into an interpreter struct, thread and interpreter local &quot;PL_*&quot; variables were defined as macros that called accessor functions, returning the address of the value, outside of the perl core. The intent was to allow members within the interpreter struct to change size without breaking binary compatibility, so that bug fixes could be merged to a maintenance branch that necessitated such a size change.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
However, some non-core code defines &quot;PERL_CORE&quot;, sometimes intentionally to bypass this mechanism for speed reasons, sometimes for other reasons but with the inadvertent side effect of bypassing this mechanism. As some of this code is widespread in production use, the result is that the core  <b>can't</b> change the size of members of the interpreter struct, as it will break such modules compiled against a previous release on that maintenance branch. The upshot is that this mechanism is redundant, and well-behaved code is penalised by it. Hence it can and should be removed.</dd>

Parsing Perl code (either with string &quot;eval&quot; or by loading modules) from within a &quot;UNITCHECK&quot; block no longer causes the interpreter to crash [perl #70614] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=70614&gt;.</dd>

When &quot;-d&quot; is used on the shebang (&quot;#!&quot;) line, the debugger now has access to the lines of the main program. In the past, this sometimes worked and sometimes did not, depending on what order things happened to be arranged in memory [perl #71806] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=71806&gt;.</dd>

The &quot;y///&quot; or &quot;tr///&quot; operator now calls get-magic (e.g., the &quot;FETCH&quot; method of a tie) on its left-hand side just once, not twice [perl #76814] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=76814&gt;.</dd>

String comparison (&quot;eq&quot;, &quot;ne&quot;, &quot;lt&quot;, &quot;gt&quot;, &quot;le&quot;, &quot;ge&quot; and &quot;cmp&quot;) and logical not (&quot;not&quot; and &quot;!&quot;) operators no longer call magic (e.g., tie methods) twice on their operands [perl #76814] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=76814&gt;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

When a tied (or other magic) variable is used as, or in, a regular expression, it no longer has its &quot;FETCH&quot; method called twice [perl #76814] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=76814&gt;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Assigning a glob to a PVLV used to convert it to a plain string. Now it works correctly, and a PVLV can hold a glob. This would happen when a nonexistent hash or array element was passed to a subroutine:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  sub { $_[0] = *foo }-&gt;($hash{key});<br/>
  # $_[0] would have been the string &quot;*main::foo&quot;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It also happened when a glob was assigned to, or returned from, an element of a tied array or hash [perl #36051] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=36051&gt;.</dd>

Creating a new thread when directory handles were open used to cause a crash, because the handles were not cloned, but simply passed to the new thread, resulting in a double free.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Now directory handles are cloned properly, on systems that have a &quot;fchdir&quot; function. On other systems, new threads simply do not inherit directory handles from their parent threads [perl #75154] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75154&gt;.</dd>

The &quot;&amp;&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;^&quot; bitwise operators no longer coerce read-only arguments [perl #20661] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20661&gt;.</dd>

Stringifying a scalar containing -0.0 no longer has the affect of turning false into true [perl #45133] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=45133&gt;.</dd>

Aliasing packages by assigning to globs or deleting packages by deleting their containing stash elements used to have erratic effects on method resolution, because the internal 'isa' caches were not reset. This has been fixed.</dd>

&quot;sort&quot; with a custom sort routine could crash if too many nested subroutine calls occurred from within the sort routine [perl #77930] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=77930&gt;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The &quot;eval_sv&quot; and &quot;eval_pv&quot; C functions now set $@ correctly when there is a syntax error and no &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; flag, and never set it if the &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; flag is present [perl #3719] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=3719&gt;.</dd>

The interpreter no longer crashes when freeing deeply-nested arrays of arrays. Hashes have not been fixed yet [perl #44225] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=44225&gt;.</dd>

The mechanism for freeing objects in globs used to leave dangling pointers to freed SVs, meaning Perl users could see corrupted state during destruction.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Perl now only frees the affected slots of the GV, rather than freeing the GV itself. This makes sure that there are no dangling refs or corrupted state during destruction.</dd>

<dd>
The typeglob &quot;*,&quot;, which holds the scalar variable $, (output field separator), had the wrong reference count in child threads.</dd>

&quot;splice&quot; now calls set-magic. This means that, for instance, changes made by &quot;splice @ISA&quot; are respected by method calls [perl #78400] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=78400&gt;.</dd>

&quot;use v5.8&quot; no longer leaks memory [perl #78436] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=78436&gt;.</dd>

The XS multicall API no longer causes subroutines to lose reference counts if called via the multicall interface from within those very subroutines. This affects modules like List::Util. Calling one of its functions with an active subroutine as the first argument could cause a crash [perl #78070] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=78070&gt;.</dd>

<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</div>
