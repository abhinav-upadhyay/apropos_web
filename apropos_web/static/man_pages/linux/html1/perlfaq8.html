<h1>NAME</h1> perlfaq8 - System Interaction</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This section of the Perl FAQ covers questions involving operating system interaction.  Topics include interprocess communication (IPC), control over the user-interface (keyboard, screen and pointing devices), and most anything else not related to data manipulation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Read the FAQs and documentation specific to the port of perl to your operating system (eg, perlvms, perlplan9, ...).  These should contain more detailed information on the vagaries of your perl.<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I find out which operating system I'm running under?</h2> The $^O variable ($OSNAME if you use &quot;English&quot;) contains an indication of the name of the operating system (not its release number) that your perl binary was built for.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How come <i>exec()</i> doesn't return?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;exec&quot; function's job is to turn your process into another command and never to return. If that's not what you want to do, don't use &quot;exec&quot;. :)<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to run an external command and still keep your Perl process going, look at a piped &quot;open&quot;, &quot;fork&quot;, or &quot;system&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I do fancy stuff with the keyboard/screen/mouse?</h2> How you access/control keyboards, screens, and pointing devices (&quot;mice&quot;) is system-dependent.  Try the following modules:<dl>
<dt>
Keyboard</dt>
<dd>
<br/>
        Term::Cap               Standard perl distribution<br/>
        Term::ReadKey           CPAN<br/>
        Term::ReadLine::Gnu     CPAN<br/>
        Term::ReadLine::Perl    CPAN<br/>
        Term::Screen            CPAN<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Screen</dt>
<dd>
<br/>
        Term::Cap               Standard perl distribution<br/>
        Curses                  CPAN<br/>
        Term::ANSIColor         CPAN<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Mouse</dt>
<dd>
<br/>
        Tk                      CPAN<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some of these specific cases are shown as examples in other answers in this section of the perlfaq.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I print something out in color?</h2> In general, you don't, because you don't know whether the recipient has a color-aware display device.  If you know that they have an ANSI terminal that understands color, you can use the &quot;Term::ANSIColor&quot; module from CPAN:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Term::ANSIColor;<br/>
        print color(&quot;red&quot;), &quot;Stop!\n&quot;, color(&quot;reset&quot;);<br/>
        print color(&quot;green&quot;), &quot;Go!\n&quot;, color(&quot;reset&quot;);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Or like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Term::ANSIColor qw(:constants);<br/>
        print RED, &quot;Stop!\n&quot;, RESET;<br/>
        print GREEN, &quot;Go!\n&quot;, RESET;<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I read just one key without waiting for a return key?</h2> Controlling input buffering is a remarkably system-dependent matter. On many systems, you can just use the  <b>stty</b> command as shown in &quot;getc&quot; in perlfunc, but as you see, that's already getting you into portability snags.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;) or die &quot;no tty: $!&quot;;<br/>
        system &quot;stty  cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;<br/>
        $key = getc(TTY);               # perhaps this works<br/>
        # OR ELSE<br/>
        sysread(TTY, $key, 1);  # probably this does<br/>
        system &quot;stty -cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;Term::ReadKey&quot; module from CPAN offers an easy-to-use interface that should be more efficient than shelling out to  <b>stty</b> for each key. It even includes limited support for Windows.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Term::ReadKey;<br/>
        ReadMode('cbreak');<br/>
        $key = ReadKey(0);<br/>
        ReadMode('normal');<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, using the code requires that you have a working C compiler and can use it to build and install a CPAN module.  Here's a solution using the standard &quot;POSIX&quot; module, which is already on your system (assuming your system supports POSIX).<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use HotKey;<br/>
        $key = readkey();<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And here's the &quot;HotKey&quot; module, which hides the somewhat mystifying calls to manipulate the POSIX termios structures.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        # HotKey.pm<br/>
        package HotKey;<br/>
<br/>
        @ISA = qw(Exporter);<br/>
        @EXPORT = qw(cbreak cooked readkey);<br/>
<br/>
        use strict;<br/>
        use POSIX qw(:termios_h);<br/>
        my ($term, $oterm, $echo, $noecho, $fd_stdin);<br/>
<br/>
        $fd_stdin = fileno(STDIN);<br/>
        $term     = POSIX::Termios-&gt;new();<br/>
        $term-&gt;getattr($fd_stdin);<br/>
        $oterm     = $term-&gt;getlflag();<br/>
<br/>
        $echo     = ECHO | ECHOK | ICANON;<br/>
        $noecho   = $oterm &amp; ~$echo;<br/>
<br/>
        sub cbreak {<br/>
                $term-&gt;setlflag($noecho);  # ok, so i don't want echo either<br/>
                $term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 1);<br/>
                $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);<br/>
        }<br/>

                cooked();<br/>
                return $key;<br/>

<h2>How do I check whether input is ready on the keyboard?</h2> The easiest way to do this is to read a key in nonblocking mode with the &quot;Term::ReadKey&quot; module from CPAN, passing it an argument of -1 to indicate not to block:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Term::ReadKey;<br/>
<br/>
        ReadMode('cbreak');<br/>
<br/>
        if (defined ($char = ReadKey(-1)) ) {<br/>
                # input was waiting and it was $char<br/>

                # no input was waiting<br/>
        }<br/>
<br/>
        ReadMode('normal');                  # restore normal tty settings<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I clear the screen?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
To clear the screen, you just have to print the special sequence that tells the terminal to clear the screen. Once you have that sequence, output it when you want to clear the screen.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can use the &quot;Term::ANSIScreen&quot; module to get the special sequence. Import the &quot;cls&quot; function (or the &quot;:screen&quot; tag):<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Term::ANSIScreen qw(cls);<br/>
        my $clear_screen = cls();<br/>
<br/>
        print $clear_screen;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;Term::Cap&quot; module can also get the special sequence if you want to deal with the low-level details of terminal control. The &quot;Tputs&quot; method returns the string for the given capability:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Term::Cap;<br/>
<br/>
        $terminal = Term::Cap-&gt;Tgetent( { OSPEED =&gt; 9600 } );<br/>
        $clear_string = $terminal-&gt;Tputs('cl');<br/>
<br/>
        print $clear_screen;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
On Windows, you can use the &quot;Win32::Console&quot; module. After creating an object for the output filehandle you want to affect, call the &quot;Cls&quot; method:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        Win32::Console;<br/>
<br/>
        $OUT = Win32::Console-&gt;new(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);<br/>
        my $clear_string = $OUT-&gt;Cls;<br/>
<br/>
        print $clear_screen;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you have a command-line program that does the job, you can call it in backticks to capture whatever it outputs so you can use it later:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $clear_string = `clear`;<br/>
<br/>
        print $clear_string;<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I get the screen size?</h2> If you have &quot;Term::ReadKey&quot; module installed from CPAN, you can use it to fetch the width and height in characters and in pixels:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Term::ReadKey;<br/>
        ($wchar, $hchar, $wpixels, $hpixels) = GetTerminalSize();<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is more portable than the raw &quot;ioctl&quot;, but not as illustrative:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        require 'sys/ioctl.ph';<br/>
        die &quot;no TIOCGWINSZ &quot; unless defined &amp;TIOCGWINSZ;<br/>
        open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;)                     or die &quot;No tty: $!&quot;;<br/>
        unless (ioctl(TTY, &amp;TIOCGWINSZ, $winsize='')) {<br/>
                die sprintf &quot;$0: ioctl TIOCGWINSZ (%08x: $!)\n&quot;, &amp;TIOCGWINSZ;<br/>
        }<br/>
        ($row, $col, $xpixel, $ypixel) = unpack('S4', $winsize);<br/>
        print &quot;(row,col) = ($row,$col)&quot;;<br/>
        print &quot;  (xpixel,ypixel) = ($xpixel,$ypixel)&quot; if $xpixel || $ypixel;<br/>
        print &quot;\n&quot;;<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I ask the user for a password?</h2> (This question has nothing to do with the web.  See a different FAQ for that.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
There's an example of this in &quot;crypt&quot; in perlfunc).  First, you put the terminal into &quot;no echo&quot; mode, then just read the password normally. You may do this with an old-style &quot;ioctl()&quot; function, POSIX terminal control (see POSIX or its documentation the Camel Book), or a call to the  <b>stty</b> program, with varying degrees of portability.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can also do this for most systems using the &quot;Term::ReadKey&quot; module from CPAN, which is easier to use and in theory more portable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use Term::ReadKey;<br/>
<br/>
        ReadMode('noecho');<br/>
        $password = ReadLine(0);<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I read and write the serial port?</h2> This depends on which operating system your program is running on.  In the case of Unix, the serial ports will be accessible through files in /dev; on other systems, device names will doubtless differ. Several problem areas common to all device interaction are the following:<dl>
<dt>
lockfiles</dt>
<dd>
Your system may use lockfiles to control multiple access.  Make sure you follow the correct protocol.  Unpredictable behavior can result from multiple processes reading from one device.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
open mode</dt>
<dd>
If you expect to use both read and write operations on the device, you'll have to open it for update (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc for details).  You may wish to open it without running the risk of blocking by using &quot;sysopen()&quot; and &quot;O_RDWR|O_NDELAY|O_NOCTTY&quot; from the &quot;Fcntl&quot; module (part of the standard perl distribution).  See &quot;sysopen&quot; in perlfunc for more on this approach.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
end of line</dt>
<dd>
Some devices will be expecting a &quot;\r&quot; at the end of each line rather than a &quot;\n&quot;.  In some ports of perl, &quot;\r&quot; and &quot;\n&quot; are different from their usual (Unix) ASCII values of &quot;\015&quot; and &quot;\012&quot;.  You may have to give the numeric values you want directly, using octal (&quot;\015&quot;), hex (&quot;0x0D&quot;), or as a control-character specification (&quot;\cM&quot;).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        print DEV &quot;atv1\012&quot;;   # wrong, for some devices<br/>
        print DEV &quot;atv1\015&quot;;   # right, for some devices<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Even though with normal text files a &quot;\n&quot; will do the trick, there is still no unified scheme for terminating a line that is portable between Unix, DOS/Win, and Macintosh, except to terminate  <i>ALL</i> line ends with &quot;\015\012&quot;, and strip what you don't need from the output. This applies especially to socket I/O and autoflushing, discussed next.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
flushing output</dt>
<dd>
If you expect characters to get to your device when you &quot;print()&quot; them, you'll want to autoflush that filehandle.  You can use &quot;select()&quot; and the $| variable to control autoflushing (see &quot;$|&quot; in perlvar and &quot;select&quot; in perlfunc, or perlfaq5, &quot;How do I flush/unbuffer an output filehandle?  Why must I do this?&quot;):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        $oldh = select(DEV);<br/>
        $| = 1;<br/>
        select($oldh);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You'll also see code that does this without a temporary variable, as in<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        select((select(DEV), $| = 1)[0]);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Or if you don't mind pulling in a few thousand lines of code just because you're afraid of a little $| variable:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        use IO::Handle;<br/>
        DEV-&gt;autoflush(1);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As mentioned in the previous item, this still doesn't work when using socket I/O between Unix and Macintosh.  You'll need to hard code your line terminators, in that case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
non-blocking input</dt>
<dd>
If you are doing a blocking &quot;read()&quot; or &quot;sysread()&quot;, you'll have to arrange for an alarm handler to provide a timeout (see &quot;alarm&quot; in perlfunc).  If you have a non-blocking open, you'll likely have a non-blocking read, which means you may have to use a 4-arg &quot;select()&quot; to determine whether I/O is ready on that device (see &quot;select&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>

While trying to read from his caller-id box, the notorious Jamie Zawinski &quot;&lt;jwz@netscape.com&gt;&quot;, after much gnashing of teeth and fighting with &quot;sysread&quot;, &quot;sysopen&quot;, POSIX's &quot;tcgetattr&quot; business, and various other functions that go bump in the night, finally came up with this:<div class="spacer">

<h2>How do I decode encrypted password files?</h2> You spend lots and lots of money on dedicated hardware, but this is bound to get you talked about.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Seriously, you can't if they are Unix password files--the Unix password system employs one-way encryption.  It's more like hashing than encryption.  The best you can do is check whether something else hashes to the same string.  You can't turn a hash back into the original string. Programs like Crack can forcibly (and intelligently) try to guess passwords, but don't (can't) guarantee quick success.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you're worried about users selecting bad passwords, you should proactively check when they try to change their password (by modifying  <i>passwd</i>(1), for example).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I start a process in the background?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
There's not a single way to run code in the background so you don't have to wait for it to finish before your program moves on to other tasks. Process management depends on your particular operating system, and many of the techniques are in perlipc.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Several CPAN modules may be able to help, including &quot;IPC::Open2&quot; or &quot;IPC::Open3&quot;, &quot;IPC::Run&quot;, &quot;Parallel::Jobs&quot;, &quot;Parallel::ForkManager&quot;, &quot;POE&quot;, &quot;Proc::Background&quot;, and &quot;Win32::Process&quot;. There are many other modules you might use, so check those namespaces for other options too.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are on a Unix-like system, you might be able to get away with a system call where you put an &quot;&amp;&quot; on the end of the command:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        system(&quot;cmd &amp;&quot;)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can also try using &quot;fork&quot;, as described in perlfunc (although this is the same thing that many of the modules will do for you).<dl>
<dt>
STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are shared</dt>
<dd>
Both the main process and the backgrounded one (the &quot;child&quot; process) share the same STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR filehandles.  If both try to access them at once, strange things can happen.  You may want to close or reopen these for the child.  You can get around this with &quot;open&quot;ing a pipe (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc) but on some systems this means that the child process cannot outlive the parent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Signals</dt>
<dd>
You'll have to catch the SIGCHLD signal, and possibly SIGPIPE too. SIGCHLD is sent when the backgrounded process finishes.  SIGPIPE is sent when you write to a filehandle whose child process has closed (an untrapped SIGPIPE can cause your program to silently die).  This is not an issue with &quot;system(&quot;cmd&amp;&quot;)&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Zombies</dt>
<dd>
You have to be prepared to &quot;reap&quot; the child process when it finishes.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        $SIG{CHLD} = sub { wait };<br/>
<br/>
        $SIG{CHLD} = 'IGNORE';<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can also use a double fork. You immediately &quot;wait()&quot; for your first child, and the init daemon will &quot;wait()&quot; for your grandchild once it exits.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        unless ($pid = fork) {<br/>
            unless (fork) {<br/>
                exec &quot;what you really wanna do&quot;;<br/>
                die &quot;exec failed!&quot;;<br/>
            }<br/>
            exit 0;<br/>
        }<br/>
        waitpid($pid, 0);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
See &quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc for other examples of code to do this. Zombies are not an issue with &quot;system(&quot;prog &amp;&quot;)&quot;.</dd>

<h2>How do I trap control characters/signals?</h2> You don't actually &quot;trap&quot; a control character.  Instead, that character generates a signal which is sent to your terminal's currently foregrounded process group, which you then trap in your process. Signals are documented in &quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc and the section on &quot;Signals&quot; in the Camel.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can set the values of the %SIG hash to be the functions you want to handle the signal.  After perl catches the signal, it looks in %SIG for a key with the same name as the signal, then calls the subroutine value for that key.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        # as an anonymous subroutine<br/>
<br/>
        $SIG{INT} = sub { syswrite(STDERR, &quot;ouch\n&quot;, 5 ) };<br/>

        # or a reference to a function<br/>

        $SIG{INT} = \&amp;ouch;<br/>
<br/>
        # or the name of the function as a string<br/>
<br/>
        $SIG{INT} = &quot;ouch&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">

Perl versions before 5.8 had in its C source code signal handlers which would catch the signal and possibly run a Perl function that you had set in %SIG.  This violated the rules of signal handling at that level causing perl to dump core. Since version 5.8.0, perl looks at %SIG  <b>after</b> the signal has been caught, rather than while it is being caught. Previous versions of this answer were incorrect.</div>

<h2>How do I modify the shadow password file on a Unix system?</h2> If perl was installed correctly and your shadow library was written properly, the &quot;getpw*()&quot; functions described in perlfunc should in theory provide (read-only) access to entries in the shadow password file.  To change the file, make a new shadow password file (the format varies from system to system--see passwd for specifics) and use pwd_mkdb(8) to install it (see pwd_mkdb for more details).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I set the time and date?</h2> Assuming you're running under sufficient permissions, you should be able to set the system-wide date and time by running the date(1) program.  (There is no way to set the time and date on a per-process basis.)  This mechanism will work for Unix, MS-DOS, Windows, and NT; the VMS equivalent is &quot;set time&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, if all you want to do is change your time zone, you can probably get away with setting an environment variable:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $ENV{TZ} = &quot;MST7MDT&quot;;              # Unixish<br/>

<h2>How can I <i>sleep()</i> or <i>alarm()</i> for under a second?</h2> If you want finer granularity than the 1 second that the &quot;sleep()&quot; function provides, the easiest way is to use the &quot;select()&quot; function as documented in &quot;select&quot; in perlfunc.  Try the &quot;Time::HiRes&quot; and the &quot;BSD::Itimer&quot; modules (available from CPAN, and starting from Perl 5.8 &quot;Time::HiRes&quot; is part of the standard distribution).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How can I measure time under a second?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;Time::HiRes&quot; module (part of the standard distribution as of Perl 5.8) measures time with the &quot;gettimeofday()&quot; system call, which returns the time in microseconds since the epoch. If you can't install &quot;Time::HiRes&quot; for older Perls and you are on a Unixish system, you may be able to call gettimeofday(2) directly. See &quot;syscall&quot; in perlfunc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How can I do an <i>atexit()</i> or <i>setjmp()</i>/<i>longjmp()</i>? (Exception handling)</h2> You can use the &quot;END&quot; block to simulate &quot;atexit()&quot;. Each package's &quot;END&quot; block is called when the program or thread ends. See the perlmod manpage for more details about &quot;END&quot; blocks.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, you can use this to make sure your filter program managed to finish its output without filling up the disk:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        END {<br/>
                close(STDOUT) || die &quot;stdout close failed: $!&quot;;<br/>
        }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;END&quot; block isn't called when untrapped signals kill the program, though, so if you use &quot;END&quot; blocks you should also use<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use sigtrap qw(die normal-signals);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl's exception-handling mechanism is its &quot;eval()&quot; operator.  You can use &quot;eval()&quot; as &quot;setjmp&quot; and &quot;die()&quot; as &quot;longjmp&quot;. For details of this, see the section on signals, especially the time-out handler for a blocking &quot;flock()&quot; in &quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc or the section on &quot;Signals&quot; in  <i>Programming Perl</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If exception handling is all you're interested in, use one of the many CPAN modules that handle exceptions, such as &quot;Try::Tiny&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want the &quot;atexit()&quot; syntax (and an &quot;rmexit()&quot; as well), try the &quot;AtExit&quot; module available from CPAN.</div>

<h2>Why doesn't my sockets program work under System V (Solaris)?  What does the error message &quot;Protocol not supported&quot; mean?</h2> Some Sys-V based systems, notably Solaris 2.X, redefined some of the standard socket constants.  Since these were constant across all architectures, they were often hardwired into perl code.  The proper way to deal with this is to &quot;use Socket&quot; to get the correct values.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that even though SunOS and Solaris are binary compatible, these values are different.  Go figure.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How can I call my system's unique C functions from Perl?</h2> In most cases, you write an external module to do it--see the answer to &quot;Where can I learn about linking C with Perl? [h2xs, xsubpp]&quot;. However, if the function is a system call, and your system supports &quot;syscall()&quot;, you can use the &quot;syscall&quot; function (documented in perlfunc).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Remember to check the modules that came with your distribution, and CPAN as well--someone may already have written a module to do it. On Windows, try &quot;Win32::API&quot;.  On Macs, try &quot;Mac::Carbon&quot;.  If no module has an interface to the C function, you can inline a bit of C in your Perl source with &quot;Inline::C&quot;.</div>

<h2>Where do I get the include files to do <i>ioctl()</i> or <i>syscall()</i>?</h2> Historically, these would be generated by the &quot;h2ph&quot; tool, part of the standard perl distribution.  This program converts cpp(1) directives in C header files to files containing subroutine definitions, like &amp;SYS_getitimer, which you can use as arguments to your functions. It doesn't work perfectly, but it usually gets most of the job done. Simple files like  <i>errno.h</i>, <i>syscall.h</i>, and <i>socket.h</i> were fine, but the hard ones like  <i>ioctl.h</i> nearly always need to be hand-edited. Here's how to install the *.ph files:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        1.  become super-user<br/>
        2.  cd /usr/include<br/>
        3.  h2ph *.h */*.h<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If your system supports dynamic loading, for reasons of portability and sanity you probably ought to use &quot;h2xs&quot; (also part of the standard perl distribution).  This tool converts C header files to Perl extensions. See perlxstut for how to get started with &quot;h2xs&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If your system doesn't support dynamic loading, you still probably ought to use &quot;h2xs&quot;.  See perlxstut and ExtUtils::MakeMaker for more information (in brief, just use  <b>make perl</b> instead of a plain  <b>make</b> to rebuild perl with a new static extension).</div>

<h2>How can I open a pipe both to and from a command?</h2> The &quot;IPC::Open2&quot; module (part of the standard perl distribution) is an easy-to-use approach that internally uses &quot;pipe()&quot;, &quot;fork()&quot;, and &quot;exec()&quot; to do the job.  Make sure you read the deadlock warnings in its documentation, though (see IPC::Open2).  See &quot;Bidirectional Communication with Another Process&quot; in perlipc and &quot;Bidirectional Communication with Yourself&quot; in perlipc<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may also use the &quot;IPC::Open3&quot; module (part of the standard perl distribution), but be warned that it has a different order of arguments from &quot;IPC::Open2&quot; (see IPC::Open3).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Why can't I get the output of a command with <i>system()</i>?</h2> You're confusing the purpose of &quot;system()&quot; and backticks (``).  &quot;system()&quot; runs a command and returns exit status information (as a 16 bit value: the low 7 bits are the signal the process died from, if any, and the high 8 bits are the actual exit value).  Backticks (``) run a command and return what it sent to STDOUT.<div class="spacer">

        $exit_status   = system(&quot;mail-users&quot;);<br/>

<h2>How can I capture STDERR from an external command?</h2> There are three basic ways of running external commands:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        system $cmd;            # using system()<br/>
        $output = `$cmd`;               # using backticks (``)<br/>
        open (PIPE, &quot;cmd |&quot;);   # using open()<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
With &quot;system()&quot;, both STDOUT and STDERR will go the same place as the script's STDOUT and STDERR, unless the &quot;system()&quot; command redirects them. Backticks and &quot;open()&quot; read  <b>only</b> the STDOUT of your command.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can also use the &quot;open3()&quot; function from &quot;IPC::Open3&quot;.  Benjamin Goldberg provides some sample code:<div class="spacer">
</div>
To capture a program's STDOUT, but discard its STDERR:<div class="spacer">

        while( &lt;PH&gt; ) { }<br/>
        waitpid($pid, 0);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To read both a command's STDOUT and its STDERR separately, you can redirect them to temp files, let the command run, then read the temp files:<div class="spacer">

<br/>
        use IPC::Open3;<br/>

        local *CATCHERR = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;<br/>
        my $pid = open3(gensym, &quot;&gt;&amp;CATCHOUT&quot;, &quot;&gt;&amp;CATCHERR&quot;, &quot;cmd&quot;);<br/>
        waitpid($pid, 0);<br/>
        seek $_, 0, 0 for \*CATCHOUT, \*CATCHERR;<br/>
        while( &lt;CATCHOUT&gt; ) {}<br/>
        while( &lt;CATCHERR&gt; ) {}<br/>

        while( &lt;CATCHERR&gt; ) {}<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And it'll be faster, too, since we can begin processing the program's stdout immediately, rather than waiting for the program to finish.<div class="spacer">
</div>
With any of these, you can change file descriptors before the call:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt;logfile&quot;);<br/>
        system(&quot;ls&quot;);<br/>

</div>
or you can use Bourne shell file-descriptor redirection:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $output = `$cmd 2&gt;some_file`;<br/>
        open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;some_file |&quot;);<br/>
<div class="spacer">

You can also use file-descriptor redirection to make STDERR a duplicate of STDOUT:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $output = `$cmd 2&gt;&amp;1`;<br/>
        open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 |&quot;);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that you <i>cannot</i> simply open STDERR to be a dup of STDOUT in your Perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection. This doesn't work:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        open(STDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDOUT&quot;);<br/>
        $alloutput = `cmd args`;  # stderr still escapes<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This fails because the &quot;open()&quot; makes STDERR go to where STDOUT was going at the time of the &quot;open()&quot;.  The backticks then make STDOUT go to a string, but don't change STDERR (which still goes to the old STDOUT).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that you <i>must</i> use Bourne shell (sh(1)) redirection syntax in backticks, not csh(1)!  Details on why Perl's &quot;system()&quot; and backtick and pipe opens all use the Bourne shell are in the  <i>versus/csh.whynot</i> article in the &quot;Far More Than You Ever Wanted To Know&quot; collection in http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz .

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Why doesn't <i>open()</i> return an error when a pipe open fails?</h2> If the second argument to a piped &quot;open()&quot; contains shell metacharacters, perl &quot;fork()&quot;s, then &quot;exec()&quot;s a shell to decode the metacharacters and eventually run the desired program.  If the program couldn't be run, it's the shell that gets the message, not Perl. All your Perl program can find out is whether the shell itself could be successfully started.  You can still capture the shell's STDERR and check it for error messages.  See &quot;How can I capture STDERR from an external command?&quot; elsewhere in this document, or use the &quot;IPC::Open3&quot; module.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If there are no shell metacharacters in the argument of &quot;open()&quot;, Perl runs the command directly, without using the shell, and can correctly report whether the command started.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>What's wrong with using backticks in a void context?</h2> Strictly speaking, nothing.  Stylistically speaking, it's not a good way to write maintainable code.  Perl has several operators for running external commands.  Backticks are one; they collect the output from the command for use in your program.  The &quot;system&quot; function is another; it doesn't do this.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Writing backticks in your program sends a clear message to the readers of your code that you wanted to collect the output of the command. Why send a clear message that isn't true?<div class="spacer">
</div>
Consider this line:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        `cat /etc/termcap`;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You forgot to check $? to see whether the program even ran correctly.  Even if you wrote<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        print `cat /etc/termcap`;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
this code could and probably should be written as<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        system(&quot;cat /etc/termcap&quot;) == 0<br/>
        or die &quot;cat program failed!&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
which will echo the cat command's output as it is generated, instead of waiting until the program has completed to print it out. It also checks the return value.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;system&quot; also provides direct control over whether shell wildcard processing may take place, whereas backticks do not.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How can I call backticks without shell processing?</h2> This is a bit tricky.  You can't simply write the command like this:<div class="spacer">

<br/>
        @ok = `grep @opts '$search_string' @filenames`;<br/>
<div class="spacer">

As of Perl 5.8.0, you can use &quot;open()&quot; with multiple arguments. Just like the list forms of &quot;system()&quot; and &quot;exec()&quot;, no shell escapes happen.<div class="spacer">

        open( GREP, &quot;-|&quot;, 'grep', @opts, $search_string, @filenames );<br/>
        chomp(@ok = &lt;GREP&gt;);<br/>

Just as with &quot;system()&quot;, no shell escapes happen when you &quot;exec()&quot; a list. Further examples of this can be found in &quot;Safe Pipe Opens&quot; in perlipc.<div class="spacer">

Note that if you're using Windows, no solution to this vexing issue is even possible.  Even though Perl emulates &quot;fork()&quot;, you'll still be stuck, because Windows does not have an argc/argv-style API.</div>

<h2>Why can't my script read from STDIN after I gave it EOF (^D on Unix, ^Z on MS-DOS)?</h2> This happens only if your perl is compiled to use stdio instead of perlio, which is the default. Some (maybe all?) stdios set error and eof flags that you may need to clear. The &quot;POSIX&quot; module defines &quot;clearerr()&quot; that you can use.  That is the technically correct way to do it.  Here are some less reliable workarounds:<dl>

<h2>How can I convert my shell script to perl?</h2> Learn Perl and rewrite it.  Seriously, there's no simple converter. Things that are awkward to do in the shell are easy to do in Perl, and this very awkwardness is what would make a shell-&gt;perl converter nigh-on impossible to write.  By rewriting it, you'll think about what you're really trying to do, and hopefully will escape the shell's pipeline datastream paradigm, which while convenient for some matters, causes many inefficiencies.</div>

<h2>How can I write expect in Perl?</h2> Once upon a time, there was a library called  <i>chat2.pl</i> (part of the standard perl distribution), which never really got finished.  If you find it somewhere,  <i>don't use it</i>.  These days, your best bet is to look at the Expect module available from CPAN, which also requires two other modules from CPAN, &quot;IO::Pty&quot; and &quot;IO::Stty&quot;.</div>

<h2>Is there a way to hide perl's command line from programs such as &quot;ps&quot;?</h2> First of all note that if you're doing this for security reasons (to avoid people seeing passwords, for example) then you should rewrite your program so that critical information is never given as an argument.  Hiding the arguments won't make your program completely secure.<div class="spacer">

To actually alter the visible command line, you can assign to the variable $0 as documented in perlvar.  This won't work on all operating systems, though.  Daemon programs like sendmail place their state there, as in:<div class="spacer">

In the strictest sense, it can't be done--the script executes as a different process from the shell it was started from.  Changes to a process are not reflected in its parent--only in any children created after the change.  There is shell magic that may allow you to fake it by &quot;eval()&quot;ing the script's output in your shell; check out the comp.unix.questions FAQ for details.</dd>

<h2>How do I close a process's filehandle without waiting for it to complete?</h2> Assuming your system supports such things, just send an appropriate signal to the process (see &quot;kill&quot; in perlfunc).

<h2>How do I find out if I'm running interactively or not?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is a difficult question to answer, and the best answer is only a guess.<div class="spacer">
</div>
What do you really want to know? If you merely want to know if one of your filehandles is connected to a terminal, you can try the &quot;-t&quot; file test:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        if( -t STDOUT ) {<br/>
                print &quot;I'm connected to a terminal!\n&quot;;<br/>
                }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, you might be out of luck if you expect that means there is a real person on the other side. With the &quot;Expect&quot; module, another program can pretend to be a person. The program might even come close to passing the Turing test.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;IO::Interactive&quot; module does the best it can to give you an answer. Its &quot;is_interactive&quot; function returns an output filehandle; that filehandle points to standard output if the module thinks the session is interactive. Otherwise, the filehandle is a null handle that simply discards the output:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use IO::Interactive;<br/>
<br/>
        print { is_interactive } &quot;I might go to standard output!\n&quot;;<br/>

This still doesn't guarantee that a real person is answering your prompts or reading your output.<div class="spacer">

If you want to know how to handle automated testing for your distribution, you can check the environment. The CPAN Testers, for instance, set the value of &quot;AUTOMATED_TESTING&quot;:<div class="spacer">

<h2>How do I timeout a slow event?</h2> Use the &quot;alarm()&quot; function, probably in conjunction with a signal handler, as documented in &quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc and the section on &quot;Signals&quot; in the Camel.  You may instead use the more flexible &quot;Sys::AlarmCall&quot; module available from CPAN.<div class="spacer">

<h2>How do I set CPU limits?</h2> (contributed by Xho)<div class="spacer">

</div>
This sets the soft and hard limits to 10 and 20 seconds, respectively. After 10 seconds of time spent running on the CPU (not &quot;wall&quot; time), the process will be sent a signal (XCPU on some systems) which, if not trapped, will cause the process to terminate.  If that signal is trapped, then after 10 more seconds (20 seconds in total) the process will be killed with a non-trappable signal.<div class="spacer">

<h2>How do I avoid zombies on a Unix system?</h2> Use the reaper code from &quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc to call &quot;wait()&quot; when a SIGCHLD is received, or else use the double-fork technique described in &quot;How do I start a process in the background?&quot; in perlfaq8.</div>

<h2>How do I use an SQL database?</h2> The &quot;DBI&quot; module provides an abstract interface to most database servers and types, including Oracle, DB2, Sybase, mysql, Postgresql, ODBC, and flat files.

<h2>How do I make a <i>system()</i> exit on control-C?</h2> You can't.  You need to imitate the &quot;system()&quot; call (see perlipc for sample code) and then have a signal handler for the INT signal that passes the signal on to the subprocess.  Or you can check for it:<div class="spacer">

<h2>How do I open a file without blocking?</h2> If you're lucky enough to be using a system that supports non-blocking reads (most Unixish systems do), you need only to use the &quot;O_NDELAY&quot; or &quot;O_NONBLOCK&quot; flag from the &quot;Fcntl&quot; module in conjunction with &quot;sysopen()&quot;:<div class="spacer">

<h2>How do I tell the difference between errors from the shell and perl?</h2> (answer contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
When you run a Perl script, something else is running the script for you, and that something else may output error messages.  The script might emit its own warnings and error messages.  Most of the time you cannot tell who said what.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You probably cannot fix the thing that runs perl, but you can change how perl outputs its warnings by defining a custom warning and die functions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Consider this script, which has an error you may not notice immediately.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        #!/usr/locl/bin/perl<br/>
<br/>
        print &quot;Hello World\n&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
I get an error when I run this from my shell (which happens to be bash).  That may look like perl forgot it has a &quot;print()&quot; function, but my shebang line is not the path to perl, so the shell runs the script, and I get the error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $ ./test<br/>
        ./test: line 3: print: command not found<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
A quick and dirty fix involves a little bit of code, but this may be all you need to figure out the problem.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        #!/usr/bin/perl -w<br/>
<br/>
        BEGIN {<br/>
        $SIG{__WARN__} = sub{ print STDERR &quot;Perl: &quot;, @_; };<br/>
        $SIG{__DIE__}  = sub{ print STDERR &quot;Perl: &quot;, @_; exit 1};<br/>

        $x / 0;<br/>
        __END__<br/>
<div class="spacer">

The perl message comes out with &quot;Perl&quot; in front.  The &quot;BEGIN&quot; block works at compile time so all of the compilation errors and warnings get the &quot;Perl:&quot; prefix too.<div class="spacer">

If I don't see that &quot;Perl:&quot;, it's not from perl.<div class="spacer">

You could also just know all the perl errors, and although there are some people who may know all of them, you probably don't.  However, they all should be in the perldiag manpage. If you don't find the error in there, it probably isn't a perl error.<div class="spacer">

Looking up every message is not the easiest way, so let perl to do it for you.  Use the diagnostics pragma with turns perl's normal messages into longer discussions on the topic.<div class="spacer">

<h2>How do I install a module from CPAN?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The easiest way is to have a module also named CPAN do it for you by using the &quot;cpan&quot; command that comes with Perl. You can give it a list of modules to install:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $ cpan IO::Interactive Getopt::Whatever<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you prefer &quot;CPANPLUS&quot;, it's just as easy:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $ cpanp i IO::Interactive Getopt::Whatever<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to install a distribution from the current directory, you can tell &quot;CPAN.pm&quot; to install &quot;.&quot; (the full stop):<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $ cpan .<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the documentation for either of those commands to see what else you can do.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to try to install a distribution by yourself, resolving all dependencies on your own, you follow one of two possible build paths.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For distributions that use <i>Makefile.PL</i>:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $ perl Makefile.PL<br/>
        $ make test install<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For distributions that use <i>Build.PL</i>:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $ perl Build.PL<br/>
        $ ./Build test<br/>
        $ ./Build install<br/>
<div class="spacer">

Some distributions may need to link to libraries or other third-party code and their build and installation sequences may be more complicated. Check any  <i>README</i> or <i>INSTALL</i> files that you may find.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>What's the difference between require and use?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl runs &quot;require&quot; statement at run-time. Once Perl loads, compiles, and runs the file, it doesn't do anything else. The &quot;use&quot; statement is the same as a &quot;require&quot; run at compile-time, but Perl also calls the &quot;import&quot; method for the loaded package. These two are the same:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use MODULE qw(import list);<br/>
<br/>
        BEGIN {<br/>
                require MODULE;<br/>
                MODULE-&gt;import(import list);<br/>
                }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, you can suppress the &quot;import&quot; by using an explicit, empty import list. Both of these still happen at compile-time:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use MODULE ();<br/>
<br/>
        BEGIN {<br/>
                require MODULE;<br/>
                }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since &quot;use&quot; will also call the &quot;import&quot; method, the actual value for &quot;MODULE&quot; must be a bareword. That is, &quot;use&quot; cannot load files by name, although &quot;require&quot; can:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        require &quot;$ENV{HOME}/lib/Foo.pm&quot;; # no @INC searching!<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the entry for &quot;use&quot; in perlfunc for more details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I keep my own module/library directory?</h2> When you build modules, tell Perl where to install the modules.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to install modules for your own use, the easiest way might be &quot;local::lib&quot;, which you can download from CPAN. It sets various installation settings for you, and uses those same settings within your programs.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want more flexibility, you need to configure your CPAN client for your particular situation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For &quot;Makefile.PL&quot;-based distributions, use the INSTALL_BASE option when generating Makefiles:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/mydir/perl<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can set this in your &quot;CPAN.pm&quot; configuration so modules automatically install in your private library directory when you use the CPAN.pm shell:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        % cpan<br/>
        cpan&gt; o conf makepl_arg INSTALL_BASE=/mydir/perl<br/>
        cpan&gt; o conf commit<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For &quot;Build.PL&quot;-based distributions, use the --install_base option:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        perl Build.PL --install_base /mydir/perl<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can configure &quot;CPAN.pm&quot; to automatically use this option too:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        % cpan<br/>
        cpan&gt; o conf mbuild_arg &quot;--install_base /mydir/perl&quot;<br/>
        cpan&gt; o conf commit<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
INSTALL_BASE tells these tools to put your modules into  <i>/mydir/perl/lib/perl5</i>.  See &quot;How do I add a directory to my include path (@INC) at runtime?&quot; for details on how to run your newly installed modules.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is one caveat with INSTALL_BASE, though, since it acts differently from the PREFIX and LIB settings that older versions of &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; advocated. INSTALL_BASE does not support installing modules for multiple versions of Perl or different architectures under the same directory. You should consider whether you really want that and, if you do, use the older PREFIX and LIB settings. See the &quot;ExtUtils::Makemaker&quot; documentation for more details.</div>

<h2>How do I add the directory my program lives in to the module/library search path?</h2> (contributed by brian d foy)<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you know the directory already, you can add it to @INC as you would for any other directory. You might &lt;use lib&gt; if you know the directory at compile time:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use lib $directory;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The trick in this task is to find the directory. Before your script does anything else (such as a &quot;chdir&quot;), you can get the current working directory with the &quot;Cwd&quot; module, which comes with Perl:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        BEGIN {<br/>
                use Cwd;<br/>
                our $directory = cwd;<br/>
                }<br/>
<br/>
        use lib $directory;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can do a similar thing with the value of $0, which holds the script name. That might hold a relative path, but &quot;rel2abs&quot; can turn it into an absolute path. Once you have the<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        BEGIN {<br/>
                use File::Spec::Functions qw(rel2abs);<br/>
                use File::Basename qw(dirname);<br/>
<br/>
                my $path   = rel2abs( $0 );<br/>
                our $directory = dirname( $path );<br/>
                }<br/>
<br/>
        use lib $directory;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;FindBin&quot; module, which comes with Perl, might work. It finds the directory of the currently running script and puts it in $Bin, which you can then use to construct the right library path:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        use FindBin qw($Bin);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can also use &quot;local::lib&quot; to do much of the same thing. Install modules using &quot;local::lib&quot;'s settings then use the module in your program:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
         use local::lib; # sets up a local lib at ~/perl5<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the &quot;local::lib&quot; documentation for more details.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>How do I add a directory to my include path (@INC) at runtime?</h2> Here are the suggested ways of modifying your include path, including environment variables, run-time switches, and in-code statements:<dl>
