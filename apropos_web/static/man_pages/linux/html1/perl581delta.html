<h1>NAME</h1> perl581delta - what is new for perl v5.8.1</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.8.0 release and the 5.8.1 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.6.1, first read the perl58delta, which describes differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In case you are wondering about 5.6.1, it was bug-fix-wise rather identical to the development release 5.7.1.  Confused?  This timeline hopefully helps a bit: it lists the new major releases, their maintenance releases, and the development releases.<div class="spacer">

<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Hash Randomisation</h2> Mainly due to security reasons, the &quot;random ordering&quot; of hashes has been made even more random.  Previously while the order of hash elements from  <i>keys()</i>, <i>values()</i>, and <i>each()</i> was essentially random, it was still repeatable.  Now, however, the order varies between different runs of Perl.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Perl has never guaranteed any ordering of the hash keys</b>, and the ordering has already changed several times during the lifetime of Perl 5.  Also, the ordering of hash keys has always been, and continues to be, affected by the insertion order.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The added randomness may affect applications.<div class="spacer">
</div>
One possible scenario is when output of an application has included hash data.  For example, if you have used the Data::Dumper module to dump data into different files, and then compared the files to see whether the data has changed, now you will have false positives since the order in which hashes are dumped will vary.  In general the cure is to sort the keys (or the values); in particular for Data::Dumper to use the &quot;Sortkeys&quot; option.  If some particular order is really important, use tied hashes: for example the Tie::IxHash module which by default preserves the order in which the hash elements were added.<div class="spacer">
</div>
More subtle problem is reliance on the order of &quot;global destruction&quot;. That is what happens at the end of execution: Perl destroys all data structures, including user data.  If your destructors (the DESTROY subroutines) have assumed any particular ordering to the global destruction, there might be problems ahead.  For example, in a destructor of one object you cannot assume that objects of any other class are still available, unless you hold a reference to them. If the environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL is set to a non-zero value, or if Perl is exiting a spawned thread, it will also destruct the ordinary references and the symbol tables that are no longer in use. You can't call a class method or an ordinary function on a class that has been collected that way.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The hash randomisation is certain to reveal hidden assumptions about some particular ordering of hash elements, and outright bugs: it revealed a few bugs in the Perl core and core modules.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To disable the hash randomisation in runtime, set the environment variable PERL_HASH_SEED to 0 (zero) before running Perl (for more information see &quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot; in perlrun), or to disable the feature completely in compile time, compile with &quot;-DNO_HASH_SEED&quot; (see  <i>INSTALL</i>).<div class="spacer">
</div>
See &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec for the original rationale behind this change.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>UTF-8 On Filehandles No Longer Activated By Locale</h2> In Perl 5.8.0 all filehandles, including the standard filehandles, were implicitly set to be in Unicode UTF-8 if the locale settings indicated the use of UTF-8.  This feature caused too many problems, so the feature was turned off and redesigned: see &quot;Core Enhancements&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Single-number v-strings are no longer v-strings before &quot;=&gt;&quot;</h2> The version strings or v-strings (see &quot;Version Strings&quot; in perldata) feature introduced in Perl 5.6.0 has been a source of some confusion-- especially when the user did not want to use it, but Perl thought it knew better.  Especially troublesome has been the feature that before a &quot;=&gt;&quot; a version string (a &quot;v&quot; followed by digits) has been interpreted as a v-string instead of a string literal.  In other words:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        %h = ( v65 =&gt; 42 );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
has meant since Perl 5.6.0<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        %h = ( 'A' =&gt; 42 );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(at least in platforms of ASCII progeny)  Perl 5.8.1 restores the more natural interpretation<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        %h = ( 'v65' =&gt; 42 );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The multi-number v-strings like v65.66 and 65.66.67 still continue to be v-strings in Perl 5.8.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>(Win32) The -C Switch Has Been Repurposed</h2> The -C switch has changed in an incompatible way.  The old semantics of this switch only made sense in Win32 and only in the &quot;use utf8&quot; universe in 5.6.x releases, and do not make sense for the Unicode implementation in 5.8.0.  Since this switch could not have been used by anyone, it has been repurposed.  The behavior that this switch enabled in 5.6.x releases may be supported in a transparent, data-dependent fashion in a future release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For the new life of this switch, see &quot;UTF-8 no longer default under UTF-8 locales&quot;, and &quot;-C&quot; in perlrun.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>(Win32) The /d Switch Of cmd.exe</h2> Perl 5.8.1 uses the /d switch when running the cmd.exe shell internally for  <i>system()</i>, backticks, and when opening pipes to external programs.  The extra switch disables the execution of AutoRun commands from the registry, which is generally considered undesirable when running external programs.  If you wish to retain compatibility with the older behavior, set PERL5SHELL in your environment to &quot;cmd /x/c&quot;.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>UTF-8 no longer default under UTF-8 locales</h2> In Perl 5.8.0 many Unicode features were introduced.   One of them was found to be of more nuisance than benefit: the automagic (and silent) &quot;UTF-8-ification&quot; of filehandles, including the standard filehandles, if the user's locale settings indicated use of UTF-8.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, if you had &quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot; as your locale, your STDIN and STDOUT were automatically &quot;UTF-8&quot;, in other words an implicit binmode(..., &quot;:utf8&quot;) was made.  This meant that trying to print, say,  <i>chr</i>(0xff), ended up printing the bytes 0xc3 0xbf.  Hardly what you had in mind unless you were aware of this feature of Perl 5.8.0. The problem is that the vast majority of people weren't: for example in RedHat releases 8 and 9 the  <b>default</b> locale setting is UTF-8, so all RedHat users got UTF-8 filehandles, whether they wanted it or not. The pain was intensified by the Unicode implementation of Perl 5.8.0 (still) having nasty bugs, especially related to the use of s/// and tr///.  (Bugs that have been fixed in 5.8.1)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Therefore a decision was made to backtrack the feature and change it from implicit silent default to explicit conscious option.  The new Perl command line option &quot;-C&quot; and its counterpart environment variable PERL_UNICODE can now be used to control how Perl and Unicode interact at interfaces like I/O and for example the command line arguments.  See &quot;-C&quot; in perlrun and &quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot; in perlrun for more information.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unsafe signals again available</h2> In Perl 5.8.0 the so-called &quot;safe signals&quot; were introduced.  This means that Perl no longer handles signals immediately but instead &quot;between opcodes&quot;, when it is safe to do so.  The earlier immediate handling easily could corrupt the internal state of Perl, resulting in mysterious crashes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, the new safer model has its problems too.  Because now an opcode, a basic unit of Perl execution, is never interrupted but instead let to run to completion, certain operations that can take a long time now really do take a long time.  For example, certain network operations have their own blocking and timeout mechanisms, and being able to interrupt them immediately would be nice.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Therefore perl 5.8.1 introduces a &quot;backdoor&quot; to restore the pre-5.8.0 (pre-5.7.3, really) signal behaviour.  Just set the environment variable PERL_SIGNALS to &quot;unsafe&quot;, and the old immediate (and unsafe) signal handling behaviour returns.  See &quot;PERL_SIGNALS&quot; in perlrun and &quot;Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)&quot; in perlipc.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In completely unrelated news, you can now use safe signals with POSIX::SigAction.  See &quot;POSIX::SigAction&quot; in POSIX.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Tied Arrays with Negative Array Indices</h2> Formerly, the indices passed to &quot;FETCH&quot;, &quot;STORE&quot;, &quot;EXISTS&quot;, and &quot;DELETE&quot; methods in tied array class were always non-negative.  If the actual argument was negative, Perl would call FETCHSIZE implicitly and add the result to the index before passing the result to the tied array method.  This behaviour is now optional.  If the tied array class contains a package variable named $NEGATIVE_INDICES which is set to a true value, negative values will be passed to &quot;FETCH&quot;, &quot;STORE&quot;, &quot;EXISTS&quot;, and &quot;DELETE&quot; unchanged.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>local ${$x}</h2> The syntaxes<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        local ${$x}<br/>
        local @{$x}<br/>
        local %{$x}<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
now do localise variables, given that the $x is a valid variable name.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Unicode Character Database 4.0.0</h2> The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has been updated to 4.0.0 from 3.2.0.  This means for example that the Unicode character properties are as in Unicode 4.0.0.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Deprecation Warnings</h2> There is one new feature deprecation.  Perl 5.8.0 forgot to add some deprecation warnings, these warnings have now been added. Finally, a reminder of an impending feature removal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>(Reminder) Pseudo-hashes are deprecated (really)</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Pseudo-hashes were deprecated in Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in Perl 5.10.0, see perl58delta for details.  Each attempt to access pseudo-hashes will trigger the warning &quot;Pseudo-hashes are deprecated&quot;. If you really want to continue using pseudo-hashes but not to see the deprecation warnings, use:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    no warnings 'deprecated';<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Or you can continue to use the fields pragma, but please don't expect the data structures to be pseudohashes any more.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>(Reminder) 5.005-style threads are deprecated (really)</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
5.005-style threads (activated by &quot;use Thread;&quot;) were deprecated in Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed after Perl 5.8, see perl58delta for details.  Each 5.005-style thread creation will trigger the warning &quot;5.005 threads are deprecated&quot;.  If you really want to continue using the 5.005 threads but not to see the deprecation warnings, use:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    no warnings 'deprecated';<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>(Reminder) The $* variable is deprecated (really)</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The $* variable controlling multi-line matching has been deprecated and will be removed after 5.8.  The variable has been deprecated for a long time, and a deprecation warning &quot;Use of $* is deprecated&quot; is given, now the variable will just finally be removed.  The functionality has been supplanted by the &quot;/s&quot; and &quot;/m&quot; modifiers on pattern matching. If you really want to continue using the $*-variable but not to see the deprecation warnings, use:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    no warnings 'deprecated';<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Miscellaneous Enhancements</h2> &quot;map&quot; in void context is no longer expensive. &quot;map&quot; is now context aware, and will not construct a list if called in void context.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a socket gets closed by the server while printing to it, the client now gets a SIGPIPE.  While this new feature was not planned, it fell naturally out of PerlIO changes, and is to be considered an accidental feature.<div class="spacer">
</div>
PerlIO::get_layers(FH) returns the names of the PerlIO layers active on a filehandle.<div class="spacer">
</div>
PerlIO::via layers can now have an optional UTF8 method to indicate whether the layer wants to &quot;auto-:utf8&quot; the stream.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>utf8::is_utf8()</i> has been added as a quick way to test whether a scalar is encoded internally in UTF-8 (Unicode).</div>

If a filehandle has been marked as to have an encoding, unmappable characters are detected already during input, not later (when the corrupted data is being used).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The ISO 8859-6 conversion table has been corrected (the 0x30..0x39 erroneously mapped to U+0660..U+0669, instead of U+0030..U+0039).  The GSM 03.38 conversion did not handle escape sequences correctly.  The UTF-7 encoding has been added (making Encode feature-complete with Unicode::String).</dd>

A lot of bugs have been fixed since v1.60, the version included in Perl v5.8.0. Especially noteworthy are the bug in Calc that caused div and mod to fail for some large values, and the fixes to the handling of bad inputs.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Some new features were added, e.g. the <i>broot()</i> method, you can now pass parameters to  <i>config()</i> to change some settings at runtime, and it is now possible to trap the creation of NaN and infinity.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As usual, some optimizations took place and made the math overall a tad faster. In some cases, quite a lot faster, actually. Especially alternative libraries like Math::BigInt::GMP benefit from this. In addition, a lot of the quite clunky routines like  <i>fsqrt()</i> and <i>flog()</i> are now much much faster.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
strict</dt>
<dd>
Earlier versions of the strict pragma did not check the parameters implicitly passed to its &quot;import&quot; (use) and &quot;unimport&quot; (no) routine. This caused the false idiom such as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        use strict qw(@ISA);<br/>
        @ISA = qw(Foo);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This however (probably) raised the false expectation that the strict refs, vars and subs were being enforced (and that @ISA was somehow &quot;declared&quot;).  But the strict refs, vars, and subs are  <b>not</b> enforced when using this false idiom.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Starting from Perl 5.8.1, the above <b>will</b> cause an error to be raised.  This may cause programs which used to execute seemingly correctly without warnings and errors to fail when run under 5.8.1. This happens because<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        use strict qw(@ISA);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
will now fail with the error:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        Unknown 'strict' tag(s) '@ISA'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The remedy to this problem is to replace this code with the correct idiom:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        use strict;<br/>
        use vars qw(@ISA);<br/>

<h1>Installation and Configuration Improvements</h1> The Unix standard Perl location,  <i>/usr/bin/perl</i>, is no longer overwritten by default if it exists.

Perl is now known to build again in LynxOS.<div class="spacer">

Mac OS X now installs with Perl version number embedded in installation directory names for easier upgrading of user-compiled Perl, and the installation directories in general are more standard. In other words, the default installation no longer breaks the Apple-provided Perl.  On the other hand, with &quot;Configure -Dprefix=/usr&quot; you can now really replace the Apple-supplied Perl ( <b>please be careful</b>).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Mac OS X now builds Perl statically by default.  This change was done mainly for faster startup times.  The Apple-provided Perl is still dynamically linked and shared, and you can enable the sharedness for your own Perl builds by &quot;Configure -Duseshrplib&quot;.<div class="spacer">

Perl has been ported to IBM's OS/400 PASE environment.  The best way to build a Perl for PASE is to use an AIX host as a cross-compilation environment.  See README.os400.<div class="spacer">

Yet another cross-compilation option has been added: now Perl builds on OpenZaurus, an Linux distribution based on Mandrake + Embedix for the Sharp Zaurus PDA.  See the Cross/README file.<div class="spacer">

<h1>Selected Bug Fixes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Closures, eval and lexicals</h2> There have been many fixes in the area of anonymous subs, lexicals and closures.  Although this means that Perl is now more &quot;correct&quot;, it is possible that some existing code will break that happens to rely on the faulty behaviour.  In practice this is unlikely unless your code contains a very complex nesting of anonymous subs, evals and lexicals.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Generic fixes</h2> If an input filehandle is marked &quot;:utf8&quot; and Perl sees illegal UTF-8 coming in when doing &quot;&lt;FH&gt;&quot;, if warnings are enabled a warning is immediately given - instead of being silent about it and Perl being unhappy about the broken data later.  (The &quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot; layer also works the same way.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
binmode(SOCKET, &quot;:utf8&quot;) only worked on the input side, not on the output side of the socket.  Now it works both ways.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For threaded Perls certain system database functions like <i>getpwent()</i> and  <i>getgrent()</i> now grow their result buffer dynamically, instead of failing.  This means that at sites with lots of users and groups the functions no longer fail by returning only partial results.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl 5.8.0 had accidentally broken the capability for users to define their own uppercase&lt;-&gt;lowercase Unicode mappings (as advertised by the Camel).  This feature has been fixed and is also documented better.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In 5.8.0 this<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $some_unicode .= &lt;FH&gt;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
didn't work correctly but instead corrupted the data.  This has now been fixed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Tied methods like FETCH etc. may now safely access tied values, i.e. resulting in a recursive call to FETCH etc.  Remember to break the recursion, though.<div class="spacer">
</div>
At startup Perl blocks the SIGFPE signal away since there isn't much Perl can do about it.  Previously this blocking was in effect also for programs executed from within Perl.  Now Perl restores the original SIGFPE handling routine, whatever it was, before running external programs.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Linenumbers in Perl scripts may now be greater than 65536, or 2**16. (Perl scripts have always been able to be larger than that, it's just that the linenumber for reported errors and warnings have &quot;wrapped around&quot;.)  While scripts that large usually indicate a need to rethink your code a bit, such Perl scripts do exist, for example as results from generated code.  Now linenumbers can go all the way to 4294967296, or 2**32.</div>

A rare access violation at Perl start-up could occur if the Perl image was installed with privileges or if there was an identifier with the subsystem attribute set in the process's rightslist.

The length limit on values (not keys) in the %ENV hash has been raised from 255 bytes to 32640 bytes (except when the PERL_ENV_TABLES setting overrides the default use of logical names for %ENV).  If it is necessary to access these long values from outside Perl, be aware that they are implemented using search list logical names that store the value in pieces, each 255-byte piece (up to 128 of them) being an element in the search list. When doing a lookup in %ENV from within Perl, the elements are combined into a single value.  The existing VMS-specific ability to access individual elements of a search list logical name via the $ENV{'foo;N'} syntax (where N is the search list index) is unimpaired.</dd>

<h1>Changed Internals</h1> These news matter to you only if you either write XS code or like to know about or hack Perl internals (using Devel::Peek or any of the &quot;B::&quot; modules counts), or like to run Perl with the &quot;-D&quot; option.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The embedding examples of perlembed have been reviewed to be up to date and consistent: for example, the correct use of  <i>PERL_SYS_INIT3()</i> and <i>PERL_SYS_TERM()</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Extensive reworking of the pad code (the code responsible for lexical variables) has been conducted by Dave Mitchell.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Extensive work on the v-strings by John Peacock.<div class="spacer">
</div>
UTF-8 length and position cache: to speed up the handling of Unicode (UTF-8) scalars, a cache was introduced.  Potential problems exist if an extension bypasses the official APIs and directly modifies the PV of an SV: the UTF-8 cache does not get cleared as it should.<div class="spacer">
</div>
APIs obsoleted in Perl 5.8.0, like sv_2pv, sv_catpvn, sv_catsv, sv_setsv, are again available.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Certain Perl core C APIs like cxinc and regatom are no longer available at all to code outside the Perl core of the Perl core extensions.  This is intentional.  They never should have been available with the shorter names, and if you application depends on them, you should (be ashamed and) contact perl5-porters to discuss what are the proper APIs.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Certain Perl core C APIs like &quot;Perl_list&quot; are no longer available without their &quot;Perl_&quot; prefix.  If your XS module stops working because some functions cannot be found, in many cases a simple fix is to add the &quot;Perl_&quot; prefix to the function and the thread context &quot;aTHX_&quot; as the first argument of the function call.  This is also how it should always have been done: letting the Perl_-less forms to leak from the core was an accident.  For cleaner embedding you can also force this for all APIs by defining at compile time the cpp define PERL_NO_SHORT_NAMES.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Perl_save_bool()</i> has been added.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Regexp objects (those created with &quot;qr&quot;) now have S-magic rather than R-magic.  This fixed regexps of the form /...(??{...;$x})/ to no longer ignore changes made to $x.  The S-magic avoids dropping the caching optimization and making (??{...}) constructs obscenely slow (and consequently useless).  See also &quot;Magic Variables&quot; in perlguts. Regexp::Copy was affected by this change.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Perl internal debugging macros <i>DEBUG()</i> and <i>DEB()</i> have been renamed to  <i>PERL_DEBUG()</i> and <i>PERL_DEB()</i> to avoid namespace conflicts.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;-DL&quot; removed (the leaktest had been broken and unsupported for years, use alternative debugging mallocs or tools like valgrind and Purify).<div class="spacer">

<h1>New Tests</h1> In Perl 5.8.0 there were about 69000 separate tests in about 700 test files, in Perl 5.8.1 there are about 77000 separate tests in about 780 test files. The exact numbers depend on the Perl configuration and on the operating system platform.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Known Problems</h1> The hash randomisation mentioned in &quot;Incompatible Changes&quot; is definitely problematic: it will wake dormant bugs and shake out bad assumptions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to use mod_perl 2.x with Perl 5.8.1, you will need mod_perl-1.99_10 or higher.  Earlier versions of mod_perl 2.x do not work with the randomised hashes.  (mod_perl 1.x works fine.) You will also need Apache::Test 1.04 or higher.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Many of the rarer platforms that worked 100% or pretty close to it with perl 5.8.0 have been left a little bit untended since their maintainers have been otherwise busy lately, and therefore there will be more failures on those platforms.  Such platforms include Mac OS Classic, IBM z/OS (and other EBCDIC platforms), and NetWare.  The most common Perl platforms (Unix and Unix-like, Microsoft platforms, and VMS) have large enough testing and expert population that they are doing well.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Tied hashes in scalar context</h2> Tied hashes do not currently return anything useful in scalar context, for example when used as boolean tests:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        if (%tied_hash) { ... }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The current nonsensical behaviour is always to return false, regardless of whether the hash is empty or has elements.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The root cause is that there is no interface for the implementors of tied hashes to implement the behaviour of a hash in scalar context.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Net::Ping 450_service and 510_ping_udp failures</h2> The subtests 9 and 18 of lib/Net/Ping/t/450_service.t, and the subtest 2 of lib/Net/Ping/t/510_ping_udp.t might fail if you have an unusual networking setup.  For example in the latter case the test is trying to send a UDP ping to the IP address 127.0.0.1.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>B::C</h2> The C-generating compiler backend B::C (the frontend being &quot;perlcc -c&quot;) is even more broken than it used to be because of the extensive lexical variable changes.  (The good news is that B::Bytecode and ByteLoader are better than they used to be.)</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Platform Specific Problems</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>EBCDIC Platforms</h2> IBM z/OS and other EBCDIC platforms continue to be problematic regarding Unicode support.  Many Unicode tests are skipped when they really should be fixed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Cygwin 1.5 problems</h2> In Cygwin 1.5 the  <i>io/tell</i> and <i>op/sysio</i> tests have failures for some yet unknown reason.  In 1.5.5 the threads tests stress_cv, stress_re, and stress_string are failing unless the environment variable PERLIO is set to &quot;perlio&quot; (which makes also the io/tell failure go away).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Perl 5.8.1 does build and work well with Cygwin 1.3: with (uname -a) &quot;CYGWIN_NT-5.0 ... 1.3.22(0.78/3/2) 2003-03-18 09:20 i686 ...&quot; a 100% &quot;make test&quot;  was achieved with &quot;Configure -des -Duseithreads&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>HP-UX: HP cc warnings about sendfile and sendpath</h2> With certain HP C compiler releases (e.g. B.11.11.02) you will get many warnings like this (lines wrapped for easier reading):<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  cc: &quot;/usr/include/sys/socket.h&quot;, line 504: warning 562:<br/>
    Redeclaration of &quot;sendfile&quot; with a different storage class specifier:<br/>
      &quot;sendfile&quot; will have internal linkage.<br/>
  cc: &quot;/usr/include/sys/socket.h&quot;, line 505: warning 562:<br/>
    Redeclaration of &quot;sendpath&quot; with a different storage class specifier:<br/>
      &quot;sendpath&quot; will have internal linkage.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The warnings show up both during the build of Perl and during certain lib/ExtUtils tests that invoke the C compiler.  The warning, however, is not serious and can be ignored.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>IRIX: t/uni/tr_7jis.t falsely failing</h2> The test t/uni/tr_7jis.t is known to report failure under 'make test' or the test harness with certain releases of IRIX (at least IRIX 6.5 and MIPSpro Compilers Version 7.3.1.1m), but if run manually the test fully passes.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Mac OS X: no usemymalloc</h2> The Perl malloc (&quot;-Dusemymalloc&quot;) does not work at all in Mac OS X. This is not that serious, though, since the native malloc works just fine.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Tru64: No threaded builds with GNU cc (gcc)</h2> In the latest Tru64 releases (e.g. v5.1B or later) gcc cannot be used to compile a threaded Perl (-Duseithreads) because the system &quot;&lt;pthread.h&gt;&quot; file doesn't know about gcc.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Win32: sysopen, sysread, syswrite</h2> As of the 5.8.0 release,  <i>sysopen()</i>/<i>sysread()</i>/<i>syswrite()</i> do not behave like they used to in 5.6.1 and earlier with respect to &quot;text&quot; mode. These built-ins now always operate in &quot;binary&quot; mode (even if  <i>sysopen()</i> was passed the O_TEXT flag, or if  <i>binmode()</i> was used on the file handle).  Note that this issue should only make a difference for disk files, as sockets and pipes have always been in &quot;binary&quot; mode in the Windows port.  As this behavior is currently considered a bug, compatible behavior may be re-introduced in a future release.  Until then, the use of  <i>sysopen()</i>, <i>sysread()</i> and <i>syswrite()</i> is not supported for &quot;text&quot; mode operations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Future Directions</h1> The following things  <b>might</b> happen in future.  The first publicly available releases having these characteristics will be the developer releases Perl 5.9.x, culminating in the Perl 5.10.0 release.  These are our best guesses at the moment: we reserve the right to rethink.<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
PerlIO will become The Default.  Currently (in Perl 5.8.x) the stdio library is still used if Perl thinks it can use certain tricks to make stdio go  <b>really</b> fast.  For future releases our goal is to make PerlIO go even faster.</dd>

A new operator &quot;//&quot; (defined-or) will be available.  This means that one will be able to say<div style="height: 1.00em;">

v-strings as they currently exist are scheduled to be deprecated.  The v-less form (1.2.3) will become a &quot;version object&quot; when used with &quot;use&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, and $VERSION.  $^V will also be a &quot;version object&quot; so the printf(&quot;%vd&quot;,...) construct will no longer be needed.  The v-ful version (v1.2.3) will become obsolete.  The equivalence of strings and v-strings (e.g. that currently 5.8.0 is equal to &quot;\5\8\0&quot;) will go away.   <b>There may be no</b>  <b>deprecation warning for v-strings</b>, though: it is quite hard to detect when v-strings are being used safely, and when they are not.</dd>
