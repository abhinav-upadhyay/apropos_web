<h1>NAME</h1> watch - execute a program periodically, showing output fullscreen</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>watch</b> [<b>-bdehpvtx</b>] [<b>-n</b> <i>seconds</i>] [<b>--beep</b>] [<b>--color</b>] [<b>--differences[=<i>cumulative</i>]]</b> [<b>--errexit</b>] [<b>--exec</b>] [<b>--help</b>] [<b>--interval=<i>seconds</i>]</b> [<b>--no-title</b>] [<b>--precise</b>] [<b>--version</b>] <i>command</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <b>watch</b> runs <i>command</i> repeatedly, displaying its output and errors (the first screenfull).  This allows you to watch the program output change over time.  By default, the program is run every 2 seconds; use <b>-n</b> or <b>--interval</b> to specify a different interval. Normally, this interval is interpreted as the amout of time between the completion of one run of <i>command</i> and the beginning of the next run. However, with the <i>-p</i> or <i>--precise</i> option, you can make <b>watch</b> attempt to run <i>command</i> every <i>interval</i> seconds. Try it with <b>ntptime</b> and notice how the fractional seconds stays (nearly) the same, as opposed to normal mode where they continuously increase.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-d</b> or <b>--differences</b> flag will highlight the differences between successive updates.  Using <b>--differences=<i>cumulative</i></b> makes highlighting &quot;sticky&quot;, presenting a running display of all positions that have ever changed.  The <b>-t</b> or <b>--no-title</b> option turns off the header showing the interval, command, and current time at the top of the display, as well as the following blank line.  The <i>-b</i> or <i>--beep</i> option causes the command to beep if it has a non-zero exit.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>watch</b> will normally run until interrupted. If you want <b>watch</b> to exit on an error from the program running use the <i>-e</i> or <i>--errexit</i> options, which will cause <b>watch</b> to exit if the return value from the program is non-zero.<div class="spacer">
</div>
By default <b>watch</b> will normally not pass escape characters, however if you use the  <i>--c</i> or <i>--color</i> option, then  <b>watch</b> will interpret ANSI color sequences for the foreground.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTE</h1> Note that <i>command</i> is given to &quot;sh -c&quot; which means that you may need to use extra quoting to get the desired effect. You can disable this with the <i>-x</i> or <i>--exec</i> option, which passes the command to exec(2) instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that POSIX option processing is used (i.e., option processing stops at the first non-option argument).  This means that flags after <i>command</i> don't get interpreted by <b>watch</b> itself.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> To watch for mail, you might do<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
watch -n 60 from</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To watch the contents of a directory change, you could use<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
watch -d ls -l</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you're only interested in files owned by user joe, you might use<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
watch -d 'ls -l | fgrep joe'</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To see the effects of quoting, try these out<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
watch echo $$<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
watch echo '$$'<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
watch echo &quot;'&quot;'$$'&quot;'&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To see the effect of precision time keeping, try adding <i>-p</i> to<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
watch -n 10 sleep 1</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can watch for your administrator to install the latest kernel with<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
watch uname -r</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(Note that <i>-p</i> isn't guaranteed to work across reboots, especially in the face of <b>ntpdate</b> or other bootup time-changing mechanisms)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS</h1> Upon terminal resize, the screen will not be correctly repainted until the next scheduled update.  All <b>--differences</b> highlighting is lost on that update as well.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Non-printing characters are stripped from program output.  Use &quot;cat -v&quot; as part of the command pipeline if you want to see them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Combining Characters that are supposed to display on the character at the last column on the screen may display one column early, or they may not display at all.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Combining Characters never count as different in <i>--differences</i> mode. Only the base character counts.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Blank lines directly after a line which ends in the last column do not display.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>--precise</i> mode doesn't yet have advanced temporal distortion technology to compensate for a <i>command</i> that takes more than <i>interval</i> seconds to execute. <b>watch</b> also can get into a state where it rapid-fires as many executions of <i>command</i> as it can to catch up from a previous executions running longer than <i>interval</i> (for example, <b>netstat</b> taking ages on a DNS lookup).</div>

<h1>AUTHORS</h1> The original <b>watch</b> was written by Tony Rems &lt;rembo@unisoft.com&gt; in 1991, with mods and corrections by Francois Pinard.  It was reworked and new features added by Mike Coleman &lt;mkc@acm.org&gt; in 1999.  The beep, exec, and error handling features were added by Morty Abzug &lt;morty@frakir.org&gt; in 2008. On a not so dark and stormy morning in March of 2003, Anthony DeRobertis &lt;asd@suespammers.org&gt; got sick of his watches that should update every minute eventually updating many seconds after the minute started, and added microsecond precision. Unicode support was added in 2009 by Jarrod Lowe &lt;procps@rrod.net&gt;.</div>
