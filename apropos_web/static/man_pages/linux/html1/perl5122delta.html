<h1>NAME</h1> perl5122delta - what is new for perl v5.12.2</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document describes differences between the 5.12.1 release and the 5.12.2 release.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier major version, such as 5.10.1, first read perl5120delta, which describes differences between 5.10.1 and 5.12.0, as well as perl5121delta, which describes earlier changes in the 5.12 stable release series.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Incompatible Changes</h1> There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.1. If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Core Enhancements</h1> Other than the bug fixes listed below, there should be no user-visible changes to the core language in this release.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Modules and Pragmata</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>New Modules and Pragmata</h2> This release does not introduce any new modules or pragmata.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Pragmata Changes</h2> In the previous release, &quot;no  <i>VERSION</i>;&quot; statements triggered a bug which could cause feature bundles to be loaded and strict mode to be enabled unintentionally.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Updated Modules</h2><dl>
<dt>
&quot;Carp&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.17.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Carp now detects incomplete <i>caller()</i> overrides and avoids using bogus @DB::args. To provide backtraces, Carp relies on particular behaviour of the caller built-in. Carp now detects if other code has overridden this with an incomplete implementation, and modifies its backtrace accordingly. Previously incomplete overrides would cause incorrect values in backtraces (best case), or obscure fatal errors (worst case)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This fixes certain cases of &quot;Bizarre copy of ARRAY&quot; caused by modules overriding &quot;caller()&quot; incorrectly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;CPANPLUS&quot;</dt>
<dd>
A patch to <i>cpanp-run-perl</i> has been backported from CPANPLUS 0.9004. This resolves RT #55964 &lt;http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=55964&gt; and RT #57106 &lt;http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=57106&gt;, both of which related to failures to install distributions that use &quot;Module::Install::DSL&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;File::Glob&quot;</dt>
<dd>
A regression which caused a failure to find &quot;CORE::GLOBAL::glob&quot; after loading &quot;File::Glob&quot; to crash has been fixed.  Now, it correctly falls back to external globbing via &quot;pp_glob&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;File::Copy&quot;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;File::Copy::copy(FILE, DIR)&quot; is now documented.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;File::Spec&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Upgraded from version 3.31 to 3.31_01.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Several portability fixes were made in &quot;File::Spec::VMS&quot;: a colon is now recognized as a delimiter in native filespecs; caret-escaped delimiters are recognized for better handling of extended filespecs; &quot;catpath()&quot; returns an empty directory rather than the current directory if the input directory name is empty; &quot;abs2rel()&quot; properly handles Unix-style input.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">

The entry for &quot;die&quot; in perlfunc was reorganized to emphasize its role in the exception mechanism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>

</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Installation and Configuration Improvements</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Configuration improvements</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;d_u32align&quot; configuration probe on ARM has been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Compilation improvements</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
An &quot;&quot;incompatible operand types&quot;&quot; error in ternary expressions when building with &quot;clang&quot; has been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Selected Bug Fixes</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A possible segfault in the &quot;T_PRTOBJ&quot; default typemap has been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A possible memory leak when using <i>caller()</i> to set @DB::args has been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Several memory leaks when loading XS modules were fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
&quot;unpack()&quot; now handles scalar context correctly for %32H and %32u, fixing a potential crash.  &quot;split()&quot; would crash because the third item on the stack wasn't the regular expression it expected.  &quot;unpack(&quot;%2H&quot;, ...)&quot; would return both the unpacked result and the checksum on the stack, as would &quot;unpack(&quot;%2u&quot;, ...)&quot;. [perl #73814] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=73814&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Perl now avoids using memory after calling &quot;free()&quot; in <i>pp_require</i> when there are CODEREFs in @INC.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A bug that could cause &quot;&quot;Unknown error&quot;&quot; messages when &quot;&quot;call_sv(code, G_EVAL)&quot;&quot; is called from an XS destructor has been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The implementation of the &quot;open $fh, '&gt;' \$buffer&quot; feature now supports get/set magic and thus tied buffers correctly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;pp_getc&quot;, &quot;pp_tell&quot;, and &quot;pp_eof&quot; opcodes now make room on the stack for their return values in cases where no argument was passed in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When matching unicode strings under some conditions inappropriate backtracking would result in a &quot;Malformed UTF-8 character (fatal)&quot; error. This should no longer occur. See  [perl #75680] &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75680&gt;</dd>

<h1>Platform Specific Notes</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>AIX</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>README.aix</i> has been updated with information about the XL C/C++ V11 compiler suite.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Windows</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
When building Perl with the mingw64 x64 cross-compiler &quot;incpath&quot;, &quot;libpth&quot;, &quot;ldflags&quot;, &quot;lddlflags&quot; and &quot;ldflags_nolargefiles&quot; values in  <i>Config.pm</i> and <i>Config_heavy.pl</i> were not previously being set correctly because, with that compiler, the include and lib directories are not immediately below &quot;$(CCHOME)&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>VMS</h2><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
<i>git_version.h</i> is now installed on VMS. This was an oversight in v5.12.0 which caused some extensions to fail to build.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Several memory leaks in <i>stat()</i> have been fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
A memory leak in &quot;Perl_rename()&quot; due to a double allocation has been fixed.</dd>

<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1> If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</div>
