Under QNX 6.2.0 there are still a few tests which fail. See below and hints/qnx.sh for more information.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Required Software for Compiling Perl on QNX4</h2> As with many unix ports, this one depends on a few &quot;standard&quot; unix utilities which are not necessarily standard for QNX4.<dl>
<dt>
/bin/sh</dt>
<dd>
This is used heavily by Configure and then by perl itself. QNX4's version is fine, but Configure will choke on the 16-bit version, so if you are running QNX 4.22, link /bin/sh to /bin32/ksh</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
ar</dt>
<dd>
This is the standard unix library builder. We use wlib. With Watcom 10.6, when wlib is linked as &quot;ar&quot;, it behaves like ar and all is fine. Under 9.5, a cover is required. One is included in ../qnx</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
nm</dt>
<dd>
This is used (optionally) by configure to list the contents of libraries. I will generate a cover function on the fly in the UU directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
cpp</dt>
<dd>
Configure and perl need a way to invoke a C preprocessor. I have created a simple cover for cc which does the right thing. Without this, Configure will create its own wrapper which works, but it doesn't handle some of the command line arguments that perl will throw at it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
make</dt>
<dd>
You really need GNU make to compile this. GNU make ships by default with QNX 4.23, but you can get it from quics for earlier versions.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Outstanding Issues with Perl on QNX4</h2> There is no support for dynamically linked libraries in QNX4.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you wish to compile with the Socket extension, you need to have the TCP/IP toolkit, and you need to make sure that -lsocket locates the correct copy of socket3r.lib. Beware that the Watcom compiler ships with a stub version of socket3r.lib which has very little functionality. Also beware the order in which wlink searches directories for libraries. You may have /usr/lib/socket3r.lib pointing to the correct library, but wlink may pick up /usr/watcom/10.6/usr/lib/socket3r.lib instead. Make sure they both point to the correct library, that is, /usr/tcptk/current/usr/lib/socket3r.lib.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following tests may report errors under QNX4:<div class="spacer">
</div>
dist/Cwd/Cwd.t will complain if `pwd` and cwd don't give the same results. cwd calls `fullpath -t`, so if you cd `fullpath -t` before running the test, it will pass.<div class="spacer">
</div>
lib/File/Find/taint.t will complain if '.' is in your PATH. The PATH test is triggered because cwd calls `fullpath -t`.<div class="spacer">
</div>
ext/IO/lib/IO/t/io_sock.t: Subtests 14 and 22 are skipped due to the fact that the functionality to read back the non-blocking status of a socket is not implemented in QNX's TCP/IP. This has been reported to QNX and it may work with later versions of TCP/IP.<div class="spacer">
</div>
t/io/tell.t: Subtest 27 is failing. We are still investigating.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>QNX auxiliary files</h2> The files in the &quot;qnx&quot; directory are:<dl>
<dt>
qnx/ar</dt>
<dd>
A script that emulates the standard unix archive (aka library) utility.  Under Watcom 10.6, ar is linked to wlib and provides the expected interface. With Watcom 9.5, a cover function is required. This one is fairly crude but has proved adequate for compiling perl.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
qnx/cpp</dt>
<dd>
A script that provides C preprocessing functionality.  Configure can generate a similar cover, but it doesn't handle all the command-line options that perl throws at it. This might be reasonably placed in /usr/local/bin.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Outstanding issues with perl under QNX6</h2> The following tests are still failing for Perl 5.8.1 under QNX 6.2.0:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  op/sprintf.........................FAILED at test 91<br/>
  lib/Benchmark......................FAILED at test 26<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is due to a bug in the C library's printf routine. printf(&quot;'%e'&quot;, 0. ) produces '0.000000e+0', but ANSI requires '0.000000e+00'. QNX has acknowledged the bug.</div>
