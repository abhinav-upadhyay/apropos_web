<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> These functions shall unblock threads blocked on a condition variable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function shall unblock all threads currently blocked on the specified condition variable  <i>cond</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() function shall unblock at least one of the threads that are blocked on the specified condition variable  <i>cond</i> (if any threads are blocked on <i>cond</i>).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If more than one thread is blocked on a condition variable, the scheduling policy shall determine the order in which threads are unblocked. When each thread unblocked as a result of a  <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or  <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() returns from its call to  <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>(), the thread shall own the mutex with which it called  <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>(). The thread(s) that are unblocked shall contend for the mutex according to the scheduling policy (if applicable), and as if each had called  <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() functions may be called by a thread whether or not it currently owns the mutex that threads calling  <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or  <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() have associated with the condition variable during their waits; however, if predictable scheduling behavior is required, then that mutex shall be locked by the thread calling  <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() and <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() functions shall have no effect if there are no threads currently blocked on  <i>cond</i>.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> If successful, the  <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() and <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() and <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() function may fail if:<dl>

<b>EINVAL</b></dt>

The value <i>cond</i> does not refer to an initialized condition variable.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> The  <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function is used whenever the shared-variable state has been changed in a way that more than one thread can proceed with its task. Consider a single producer/multiple consumer problem, where the producer can insert multiple items on a list that is accessed one item at a time by the consumers. By calling the  <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function, the producer would notify all consumers that might be waiting, and thereby the application would receive more throughput on a multi-processor. In addition,  <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() makes it easier to implement a read-write lock. The  <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function is needed in order to wake up all waiting readers when a writer releases its lock. Finally, the two-phase commit algorithm can use this broadcast function to notify all clients of an impending transaction commit.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is not safe to use the <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() function in a signal handler that is invoked asynchronously. Even if it were safe, there would still be a race between the test of the Boolean  <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() that could not be efficiently eliminated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Mutexes and condition variables are thus not suitable for releasing a waiting thread by signaling from code running in a signal handler.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Multiple Awakenings by Condition Signal</h2> On a multi-processor, it may be impossible for an implementation of  <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() to avoid the unblocking of more than one thread blocked on a condition variable. For example, consider the following partial implementation of  <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() and  <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>(), executed by two threads in the order given. One thread is trying to wait on the condition variable, another is concurrently executing  <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>(), while a third thread is already waiting.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

The effect is that more than one thread can return from its call to  <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() as a result of one call to  <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>(). This effect is called &quot;spurious wakeup&quot;. Note that the situation is self-correcting in that the number of threads that are so awakened is finite; for example, the next thread to call  <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() after the sequence of events above blocks.<div class="spacer">
</div>
While this problem could be resolved, the loss of efficiency for a fringe condition that occurs only rarely is unacceptable, especially given that one has to check the predicate associated with a condition variable anyway. Correcting this problem would unnecessarily reduce the degree of concurrency in this basic building block for all higher-level synchronization operations.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An added benefit of allowing spurious wakeups is that applications are forced to code a predicate-testing-loop around the condition wait. This also makes the application tolerate superfluous condition broadcasts or signals on the same condition variable that may be coded in some other part of the application. The resulting applications are thus more robust. Therefore, IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 explicitly documents that spurious wakeups may occur.</div>
