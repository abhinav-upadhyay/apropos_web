<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions shall create a new process (child process) from the specified process image. The new process image shall be constructed from a regular executable file called the new process image file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a C program is executed as the result of this call, it shall be entered as a C-language function call as follows:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>int main(int</b> <i>argc</i><b>, char *</b><i>argv</i><b>[]);</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
where <i>argc</i> is the argument count and <i>argv</i> is an array of character pointers to the arguments themselves. In addition, the following variable:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>extern char **environ;</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
shall be initialized as a pointer to an array of character pointers to the environment strings.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The argument <i>argv</i> is an array of character pointers to null-terminated strings. The last member of this array shall be a null pointer and is not counted in  <i>argc</i>. These strings constitute the argument list available to the new process image. The value in  <i>argv</i>[0] should point to a filename that is associated with the process image being started by the  <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() function.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The argument <i>envp</i> is an array of character pointers to null-terminated strings. These strings constitute the environment for the new process image. The environment array is terminated by a null pointer.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The number of bytes available for the child process' combined argument and environment lists is {ARG_MAX}. The implementation shall specify in the system documentation (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Chapter 2, Conformance) whether any list overhead, such as length words, null terminators, pointers, or alignment bytes, is included in this total.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>path</i> argument to <i>posix_spawn</i>() is a pathname that identifies the new process image file to execute.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>file</i> parameter to <i>posix_spawnp</i>() shall be used to construct a pathname that identifies the new process image file. If the  <i>file</i> parameter contains a slash character, the  <i>file</i> parameter shall be used as the pathname for the new process image file. Otherwise, the path prefix for this file shall be obtained by a search of the directories passed as the environment variable  <i>PATH</i> (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables). If this environment variable is not defined, the results of the search are implementation-defined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>file_actions</i> is a null pointer, then file descriptors open in the calling process shall remain open in the child process, except for those whose close-on-  <i>exec</i> flag FD_CLOEXEC is set (see  <i>fcntl</i>()). For those file descriptors that remain open, all attributes of the corresponding open file descriptions, including file locks (see  <i>fcntl</i>()), shall remain unchanged.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>file_actions</i> is not NULL, then the file descriptors open in the child process shall be those open in the calling process as modified by the spawn file actions object pointed to by  <i>file_actions</i> and the FD_CLOEXEC flag of each remaining open file descriptor after the spawn file actions have been processed. The effective order of processing the spawn file actions shall be:<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
The set of open file descriptors for the child process shall initially be the same set as is open for the calling process. All attributes of the corresponding open file descriptions, including file locks (see  <i>fcntl</i>()), shall remain unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
The signal mask, signal default actions, and the effective user and group IDs for the child process shall be changed as specified in the attributes object referenced by  <i>attrp</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 3.</dt>
<dd>
The file actions specified by the spawn file actions object shall be performed in the order in which they were added to the spawn file actions object.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 4.</dt>
<dd>
Any file descriptor that has its FD_CLOEXEC flag set (see <i>fcntl</i>() ) shall be closed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>posix_spawnattr_t</b> spawn attributes object type is defined in  <i>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</i>. It shall contain at least the attributes defined below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i>, and the  <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the same object is non-zero, then the child's process group shall be as specified in the  <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a special case, if the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the  <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i>, and the <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the same object is set to zero, then the child shall be in a new process group with a process group ID equal to its process ID.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is not set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i>, the new child process shall inherit the parent's process group.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag is set in the  <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i>, but POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is not set, the new process image shall initially have the scheduling policy of the calling process with the scheduling parameters specified in the  <i>spawn-schedparam</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i> (regardless of the setting of the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag), the new process image shall initially have the scheduling policy specified in the  <i>spawn-schedpolicy</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i> and the scheduling parameters specified in the  <i>spawn-schedparam</i> attribute of the same object.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i> governs the effective user ID of the child process. If this flag is not set, the child process shall inherit the parent process' effective user ID. If this flag is set, the child process' effective user ID shall be reset to the parent's real user ID. In either case, if the set-user-ID mode bit of the new process image file is set, the effective user ID of the child process shall become that file's owner ID before the new process image begins execution.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i> also governs the effective group ID of the child process. If this flag is not set, the child process shall inherit the parent process' effective group ID. If this flag is set, the child process' effective group ID shall be reset to the parent's real group ID. In either case, if the set-group-ID mode bit of the new process image file is set, the effective group ID of the child process shall become that file's group ID before the new process image begins execution.<div class="spacer">

If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i>, the child process shall initially have the signal mask specified in the  <i>spawn-sigmask</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i>.<div class="spacer">

If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i>, the signals specified in the  <i>spawn-sigdefault</i> attribute of the same object shall be set to their default actions in the child process. Signals set to the default action in the parent process shall be set to the default action in the child process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Signals set to be caught by the calling process shall be set to the default action in the child process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Except for SIGCHLD, signals set to be ignored by the calling process image shall be set to be ignored by the child process, unless otherwise specified by the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being set in the  <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i> and the signals being indicated in the <i>spawn-sigdefault</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the SIGCHLD signal is set to be ignored by the calling process, it is unspecified whether the SIGCHLD signal is set to be ignored or to the default action in the child process, unless otherwise specified by the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being set in the  <i>spawn_flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> and the SIGCHLD signal being indicated in the  <i>spawn_sigdefault</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the value of the <i>attrp</i> pointer is NULL, then the default values are used.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All process attributes, other than those influenced by the attributes set in the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i> as specified above or by the file descriptor manipulations specified in  <i>file_actions</i>, shall appear in the new process image as though  <i>fork</i>() had been called to create a child process and then a member of the  <i>exec</i> family of functions had been called by the child process to execute the new process image.<div class="spacer">

It is implementation-defined whether the fork handlers are run when  <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is called.</div>

<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion,  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() shall return the process ID of the child process to the parent process, in the variable pointed to by a non-NULL  <i>pid</i> argument, and shall return zero as the function return value. Otherwise, no child process shall be created, the value stored into the variable pointed to by a non-NULL  <i>pid</i> is unspecified, and an error number shall be returned as the function return value to indicate the error.

<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> These functions are part of the Spawn option and need not be provided on all implementations.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> The  <i>posix_spawn</i>() function and its close relation <i>posix_spawnp</i>() have been introduced to overcome the following perceived difficulties with  <i>fork</i>(): the <i>fork</i>() function is difficult or impossible to implement without swapping or dynamic address translation.<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Swapping is generally too slow for a realtime environment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Dynamic address translation is not available everywhere that POSIX might be useful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Processes are too useful to simply option out of POSIX whenever it must run without address translation or other MMU services.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Thus, POSIX needs process creation and file execution primitives that can be efficiently implemented without address translation or other MMU services.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>posix_spawn</i>() function is implementable as a library routine, but both  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() are designed as kernel operations. Also, although they may be an efficient replacement for many  <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i> pairs, their goal is to provide useful process creation primitives for systems that have difficulty with  <i>fork</i>(), not to provide drop-in replacements for  <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This view of the role of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() influenced the design of their API. It does not attempt to provide the full functionality of  <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i> in which arbitrary user-specified operations of any sort are permitted between the creation of the child process and the execution of the new process image; any attempt to reach that level would need to provide a programming language as parameters. Instead,  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and  <i>posix_spawnp</i>() are process creation primitives like the  <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i> Ada language bindings package  <i>POSIX_Process_Primitives</i> and also like those in many operating systems that are not UNIX systems, but with some POSIX-specific additions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To achieve its coverage goals, <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() have control of six types of inheritance: file descriptors, process group ID, user and group ID, signal mask, scheduling, and whether each signal ignored in the parent will remain ignored in the child, or be reset to its default action in the child.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Control of file descriptors is required to allow an independently written child process image to access data streams opened by and even generated or read by the parent process without being specifically coded to know which parent files and file descriptors are to be used. Control of the process group ID is required to control how the child process' job control relates to that of the parent.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Control of the signal mask and signal defaulting is sufficient to support the implementation of  <i>system</i>(). Although support for  <i>system</i>() is not explicitly one of the goals for  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>(), it is covered under the &quot;at least 50%&quot; coverage goal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The intention is that the normal file descriptor inheritance across  <i>fork</i>(), the subsequent effect of the specified spawn file actions, and the normal file descriptor inheritance across one of the  <i>exec</i> family of functions should fully specify open file inheritance. The implementation need make no decisions regarding the set of open file descriptors when the child process image begins execution, those decisions having already been made by the caller and expressed as the set of open file descriptors and their FD_CLOEXEC flags at the time of the call and the spawn file actions object specified in the call. We have been assured that in cases where the POSIX  <i>Start_Process</i> Ada primitives have been implemented in a library, this method of controlling file descriptor inheritance may be implemented very easily.<div class="spacer">
</div>
We can identify several problems with <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>(), but there does not appear to be a solution that introduces fewer problems. Environment modification for child process attributes not specifiable via the  <i>attrp</i> or  <i>file_actions</i> arguments must be done in the parent process, and since the parent generally wants to save its context, it is more costly than similar functionality with  <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i>. It is also complicated to modify the environment of a multi-threaded process temporarily, since all threads must agree when it is safe for the environment to be changed. However, this cost is only borne by those invocations of  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() that use the additional functionality. Since extensive modifications are not the usual case, and are particularly unlikely in time-critical code, keeping much of the environment control out of  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is appropriate design.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions do not have all the power of  <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i>. This is to be expected. The  <i>fork</i>() function is a wonderfully powerful operation. We do not expect to duplicate its functionality in a simple, fast function with no special hardware requirements. It is worth noting that  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and  <i>posix_spawnp</i>() are very similar to the process creation operations on many operating systems that are not UNIX systems.<div class="subsection">

</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Two-Syntax</h2> POSIX  <i>exec</i> has several calling sequences with approximately the same functionality. These appear to be required for compatibility with existing practice. Since the existing practice for the  <i>posix_spawn*</i>() functions is otherwise substantially unlike POSIX, we feel that simplicity outweighs compatibility. There are, therefore, only two names for the  <i>posix_spawn*</i>() functions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The parameter list does not differ between <i>posix_spawn</i>() and  <i>posix_spawnp</i>(); <i>posix_spawnp</i>() interprets the second parameter more elaborately than  <i>posix_spawn</i>().</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Compatibility with POSIX.5 (Ada)</h2> The  <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i> procedures from the  <i>POSIX_Process_Primitives</i> package from the Ada language binding to POSIX.1 encapsulate  <i>fork</i>() and <i>exec</i> functionality in a manner similar to that of  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and  <i>posix_spawnp</i>(). Originally, in keeping with our simplicity goal, the standard developers had limited the capabilities of  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and  <i>posix_spawnp</i>() to a subset of the capabilities of <i>Start_Process</i> and  <i>Start_Process_Search</i>; certain non-default capabilities were not supported. However, based on suggestions by the ballot group to improve file descriptor mapping or drop it, and on the advice of an Ada Language Bindings working group member, the standard developers decided that  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and  <i>posix_spawnp</i>() should be sufficiently powerful to implement  <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i>. The rationale is that if the Ada language binding to such a primitive had already been approved as an IEEE standard, there can be little justification for not approving the functionally-equivalent parts of a C binding. The only three capabilities provided by  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() that are not provided by  <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i> are optionally specifying the child's process group ID, the set of signals to be reset to default signal handling in the child process, and the child's scheduling policy and parameters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For the Ada language binding for <i>Start_Process</i> to be implemented with  <i>posix_spawn</i>(), that binding would need to explicitly pass an empty signal mask and the parent's environment to  <i>posix_spawn</i>() whenever the caller of  <i>Start_Process</i> allowed these arguments to default, since <i>posix_spawn</i>() does not provide such defaults. The ability of  <i>Start_Process</i> to mask user-specified signals during its execution is functionally unique to the Ada language binding and must be dealt with in the binding separately from the call to  <i>posix_spawn</i>().</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Process Group</h2> The process group inheritance field can be used to join the child process with an existing process group. By assigning a value of zero to the  <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the object referenced by  <i>attrp</i>, the <i>setpgid</i>() mechanism will place the child process in a new process group.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Threads</h2> Without the  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions, systems without address translation can still use threads to give an abstraction of concurrency. In many cases, thread creation suffices, but it is not always a good substitute. The  <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions are considerably &quot;heavier&quot; than thread creation. Processes have several important attributes that threads do not. Even without address translation, a process may have base-and-bound memory protection. Each process has a process environment including security attributes and file capabilities, and powerful scheduling attributes. Processes abstract the behavior of non-uniform-memory-architecture multi-processors better than threads, and they are more convenient to use for activities that are not closely linked.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions may not bring support for multiple processes to every configuration. Process creation is not the only piece of operating system support required to support multiple processes. The total cost of support for multiple processes may be quite high in some circumstances. Existing practice shows that support for multiple processes is uncommon and threads are common among &quot;tiny kernels&quot;. There should, therefore, probably continue to be AEPs for operating systems with only one process.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Asynchronous Error Notification</h2> A library implementation of  <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() may not be able to detect all possible errors before it forks the child process. IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 provides for an error indication returned from a child process which could not successfully complete the spawn operation via a special exit status which may be detected using the status value returned by  <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>stat_val</i> interface and the macros used to interpret it are not well suited to the purpose of returning API errors, but they are the only path available to a library implementation. Thus, an implementation may cause the child process to exit with exit status 127 for any error detected during the spawn process after the  <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() function has successfully returned.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The standard developers had proposed using two additional macros to interpret  <i>stat_val</i>. The first, WIFSPAWNFAIL, would have detected a status that indicated that the child exited because of an error detected during the  <i>posix_spawn</i>() or  <i>posix_spawnp</i>() operations rather than during actual execution of the child process image; the second, WSPAWNERRNO, would have extracted the error value if WIFSPAWNFAIL indicated a failure. Unfortunately, the ballot group strongly opposed this because it would make a library implementation of  <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() dependent on kernel modifications to  <i>waitpid</i>() to be able to embed special information in  <i>stat_val</i> to indicate a spawn failure.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The 8 bits of child process exit status that are guaranteed by IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 to be accessible to the waiting parent process are insufficient to disambiguate a spawn error from any other kind of error that may be returned by an arbitrary process image. No other bits of the exit status are required to be visible in  <i>stat_val</i>, so these macros could not be strictly implemented at the library level. Reserving an exit status of 127 for such spawn errors is consistent with the use of this value by  <i>system</i>() and <i>popen</i>() to signal failures in these operations that occur after the function has returned but before a shell is able to execute. The exit status of 127 does not uniquely identify this class of error, nor does it provide any detailed information on the nature of the failure. Note that a kernel implementation of  <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is permitted (and encouraged) to return any possible error as the function value, thus providing more detailed failure information to the parent process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Thus, no special macros are available to isolate asynchronous <i>posix_spawn</i>() or  <i>posix_spawnp</i>() errors. Instead, errors detected by the  <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() operations in the context of the child process before the new process image executes are reported by setting the child's exit status to 127. The calling process may use the WIFEXITED and WEXITSTATUS macros on the  <i>stat_val</i> stored by the <i>wait</i>() or  <i>waitpid</i>() functions to detect spawn failures to the extent that other status values with which the child process image may exit (before the parent can conclusively determine that the child process image has begun execution) are distinct from exit status 127.</div>
