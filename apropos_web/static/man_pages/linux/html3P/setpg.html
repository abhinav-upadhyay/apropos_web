<h1>NAME</h1> setpgid - set process group ID for job control</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>  <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
int setpgid(pid_t<b> </b><i>pid</i><b></b><b>, pid_t</b><b> </b><i>pgid</i><b></b><b>);</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>setpgid</i>() function shall either join an existing process group or create a new process group within the session of the calling process. The process group ID of a session leader shall not change. Upon successful completion, the process group ID of the process with a process ID that matches  <i>pid</i> shall be set to  <i>pgid</i>. As a special case, if <i>pid</i> is 0, the process ID of the calling process shall be used. Also, if  <i>pgid</i> is 0, the process ID of the indicated process shall be used.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion,  <i>setpgid</i>() shall return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and  <i>errno</i> shall be set to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>setpgid</i>() function shall fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EACCES</b></dt>
<dd>
The value of the <i>pid</i> argument matches the process ID of a child process of the calling process and the child process has successfully executed one of the  <i>exec</i> functions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
The value of the <i>pgid</i> argument is less than 0, or is not a value supported by the implementation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EPERM</b></dt>
<dd>
The process indicated by the <i>pid</i> argument is a session leader.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EPERM</b></dt>
<dd>
The value of the <i>pid</i> argument matches the process ID of a child process of the calling process and the child process is not in the same session as the calling process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EPERM</b></dt>
<dd>
The value of the <i>pgid</i> argument is valid but does not match the process ID of the process indicated by the  <i>pid</i> argument and there is no process with a process group ID that matches the value of the  <i>pgid</i> argument in the same session as the calling process.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>ESRCH</b></dt>
<dd>
The value of the <i>pid</i> argument does not match the process ID of the calling process or of a child process of the calling process.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> The  <i>setpgid</i>() function shall group processes together for the purpose of signaling, placement in foreground or background, and other job control actions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>setpgid</i>() function is similar to the <i>setpgrp</i>() function of 4.2 BSD, except that 4.2 BSD allowed the specified new process group to assume any value. This presents certain security problems and is more flexible than necessary to support job control.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To provide tighter security, <i>setpgid</i>() only allows the calling process to join a process group already in use inside its session or create a new process group whose process group ID was equal to its process ID.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a job control shell spawns a new job, the processes in the job must be placed into a new process group via  <i>setpgid</i>(). There are two timing constraints involved in this action:<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
The new process must be placed in the new process group before the appropriate program is launched via one of the  <i>exec</i> functions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
The new process must be placed in the new process group before the shell can correctly send signals to the new process group.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To address these constraints, the following actions are performed. The new processes call  <i>setpgid</i>() to alter their own process groups after  <i>fork</i>() but before <i>exec</i>. This satisfies the first constraint. Under 4.3 BSD, the second constraint is satisfied by the synchronization property of  <i>vfork</i>(); that is, the shell is suspended until the child has completed the  <i>exec</i>, thus ensuring that the child has completed the  <i>setpgid</i>(). A new version of <i>fork</i>() with this same synchronization property was considered, but it was decided instead to merely allow the parent shell process to adjust the process group of its child processes via  <i>setpgid</i>(). Both timing constraints are now satisfied by having both the parent shell and the child attempt to adjust the process group of the child process; it does not matter which succeeds first.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since it would be confusing to an application to have its process group change after it began executing (that is, after  <i>exec</i>), and because the child process would already have adjusted its process group before this, the [EACCES] error was added to disallow this.<div class="spacer">
</div>
One non-obvious use of <i>setpgid</i>() is to allow a job control shell to return itself to its original process group (the one in effect when the job control shell was executed). A job control shell does this before returning control back to its parent when it is terminating or suspending itself as a way of restoring its job control &quot;state&quot; back to what its parent would expect. (Note that the original process group of the job control shell typically matches the process group of its parent, but this is not necessarily always the case.)</div>
