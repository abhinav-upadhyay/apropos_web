<h1>NAME</h1> ntfs-3g.usermap - NTFS Building a User Mapping File</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>ntfs-3g.usermap</b>  <i>windows-system-device</i>  <b>[</b><i>other-ntfs-device</i><b>...</b><b>]</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
Where <i>windows-system-device</i> is the device containing the Windows system whose users are to be mapped to current Linux system.<div class="spacer">
</div>
And <i>other-ntfs-device</i> is another device containing files which are to be accessed both by the Windows mentioned above and current Linux system.<div class="spacer">
</div>
the ntfs-3g.usermap command must be started as root, and the designated devices must not be mounted.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Typing ntfs-3g.usermap with no args will display a summary of command arguments.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <b>ntfs-3g.usermap</b> creates the file defining the mapping of Windows accounts to Linux logins for users who owns files which should be visible from both Windows and Linux.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It relies on existing files which were created on Windows, trying to locate significant files and asking which Linux user or group should own them. When a Linux owner or group is requested, the reply may be :<div class="spacer">
</div>
- the uid or gid (numeric or symbolic) of Linux owner or group of the file.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
In that situation, no more file with the same Windows owner will be selected.</div>
- or no answer, when not able to define the owner or group.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
In that situation another file owned by the same Windows user or group may be selected later so that a mapping can be defined.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The mappings for standard Windows users, such as &quot;Administrator&quot; or &quot;All Users&quot; are defined implicitly. As a consequence a user mapping should never be defined as Linux root.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When there are no more significant files, ntfs-3g.usermap create the mapping file into the file UserMapping in the current directory. This file has to be moved to the hidden directory .NTFS-3G in the root of all the NTFS file systems to be shared between Windows and Linux. This requires the file system to be mounted, but the created file will not be taken into account if not present at mount time, which means the file system has to be unmounted and mounted again for the new mapping file to be taken into account.</div>
