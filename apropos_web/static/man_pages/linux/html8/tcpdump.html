<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <i>Tcpdump</i> prints out a description of the contents of packets on a network interface that match the boolean  <i>expression</i>.  It can also be run with the <b>-w</b> flag, which causes it to save the packet data to a file for later analysis, and/or with the <b>-r</b> flag, which causes it to read from a saved packet file rather than to read packets from a network interface (please note  <i>tcpdump</i> is protected via an enforcing <b>apparmor</b>(7) profile in Ubuntu which limits the files  <i>tcpdump</i> may access). In all cases, only packets that match <i>expression</i> will be processed by <i>tcpdump</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Tcpdump</i> will, if not run with the <b>-c</b> flag, continue capturing packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT signal (generated, for example, by typing your interrupt character, typically control-C) or a SIGTERM signal (typically generated with the <b>kill</b>(1) command); if run with the <b>-c</b> flag, it will capture packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal or the specified number of packets have been processed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <i>tcpdump</i> finishes capturing packets, it will report counts of:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
packets ``captured'' (this is the number of packets that <i>tcpdump</i> has received and processed);</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
packets ``received by filter'' (the meaning of this depends on the OS on which you're running <i>tcpdump</i>, and possibly on the way the OS was configured - if a filter was specified on the command line, on some OSes it counts packets regardless of whether they were matched by the filter expression and, even if they were matched by the filter expression, regardless of whether <i>tcpdump</i> has read and processed them yet, on other OSes it counts only packets that were matched by the filter expression regardless of whether <i>tcpdump</i> has read and processed them yet, and on other OSes it counts only packets that were matched by the filter expression and were processed by <i>tcpdump</i>);</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
packets ``dropped by kernel'' (this is the number of packets that were dropped, due to a lack of buffer space, by the packet capture mechanism in the OS on which <i>tcpdump</i> is running, if the OS reports that information to applications; if not, it will be reported as 0).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
On platforms that support the SIGINFO signal, such as most BSDs (including Mac OS X) and Digital/Tru64 UNIX, it will report those counts when it receives a SIGINFO signal (generated, for example, by typing your ``status'' character, typically control-T, although on some platforms, such as Mac OS X, the ``status'' character is not set by default, so you must set it with <b>stty</b>(1) in order to use it) and will continue capturing packets.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Reading packets from a network interface may require that you have special privileges; see the <b>pcap (3PCAP)</b> man page for details.  Reading a saved packet file doesn't require special privileges.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>-A</b></dt>
<dd>
Print each packet (minus its link level header) in ASCII.  Handy for capturing web pages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-b</b></dt>
<dd>
Print the AS number in BGP packets in ASDOT notation rather than ASPLAIN notation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-B</b></dt>
<dd>
Set the operating system capture buffer size to <i>buffer_size</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-c</b></dt>
<dd>
Exit after receiving <i>count</i> packets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-C</b></dt>
<dd>
Before writing a raw packet to a savefile, check whether the file is currently larger than  <i>file_size</i> and, if so, close the current savefile and open a new one.  Savefiles after the first savefile will have the name specified with the <b>-w</b> flag, with a number after it, starting at 1 and continuing upward. The units of  <i>file_size</i> are millions of bytes (1,000,000 bytes, not 1,048,576 bytes).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-d</b></dt>
<dd>
Dump the compiled packet-matching code in a human readable form to standard output and stop.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-dd</b></dt>
<dd>
Dump packet-matching code as a <b>C</b> program fragment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-ddd</b></dt>
<dd>
Dump packet-matching code as decimal numbers (preceded with a count).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-D</b></dt>
<dd>
Print the list of the network interfaces available on the system and on which <i>tcpdump</i> can capture packets.  For each network interface, a number and an interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the interface, is printed.  The interface name or the number can be supplied to the <b>-i</b> flag to specify an interface on which to capture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This can be useful on systems that don't have a command to list them (e.g., Windows systems, or UNIX systems lacking <b>ifconfig -a</b>); the number can be useful on Windows 2000 and later systems, where the interface name is a somewhat complex string.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The <b>-D</b> flag will not be supported if <i>tcpdump</i> was built with an older version of <i>libpcap</i> that lacks the <b>pcap_findalldevs()</b> function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-e</b></dt>
<dd>
Print the link-level header on each dump line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-E</b></dt>
<dd>
Use <i>spi@ipaddr algo:secret</i> for decrypting IPsec ESP packets that are addressed to  <i>addr</i> and contain Security Parameter Index value  <i>spi</i>. This combination may be repeated with comma or newline separation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Note that setting the secret for IPv4 ESP packets is supported at this time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Algorithms may be  <b>des-cbc</b>,  <b>3des-cbc</b>,  <b>blowfish-cbc</b>,  <b>rc3-cbc</b>,  <b>cast128-cbc</b>, or  <b>none</b>. The default is  <b>des-cbc</b>. The ability to decrypt packets is only present if  <i>tcpdump</i> was compiled with cryptography enabled.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<i>secret</i> is the ASCII text for ESP secret key. If preceded by 0x, then a hex value will be read.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The option assumes RFC2406 ESP, not RFC1827 ESP. The option is only for debugging purposes, and the use of this option with a true `secret' key is discouraged. By presenting IPsec secret key onto command line you make it visible to others, via <i>ps</i>(1) and other occasions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
In addition to the above syntax, the syntax <i>file name</i> may be used to have tcpdump read the provided file in. The file is opened upon receiving the first ESP packet, so any special permissions that tcpdump may have been given should already have been given up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-f</b></dt>
<dd>
Print `foreign' IPv4 addresses numerically rather than symbolically (this option is intended to get around serious brain damage in Sun's NIS server &#8212; usually it hangs forever translating non-local internet numbers).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The test for `foreign' IPv4 addresses is done using the IPv4 address and netmask of the interface on which capture is being done.  If that address or netmask are not available, available, either because the interface on which capture is being done has no address or netmask or because the capture is being done on the Linux &quot;any&quot; interface, which can capture on more than one interface, this option will not work correctly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-F</b></dt>
<dd>
Use <i>file</i> as input for the filter expression. An additional expression given on the command line is ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-G</b></dt>
<dd>
If specified, rotates the dump file specified with the <b>-w</b> option every  <i>rotate_seconds</i> seconds. Savefiles will have the name specified by <b>-w</b> which should include a time format as defined by <b>strftime</b>(3). If no time format is specified, each new file will overwrite the previous.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If used in conjunction with the <b>-C</b> option, filenames will take the form of ` <i>file</i>&lt;count&gt;'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-h</b></dt>
<dd>
Print the tcpdump and libpcap version strings, print a usage message, and exit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-H</b></dt>
<dd>
Attempt to detect 802.11s draft mesh headers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-i</b></dt>
<dd>
Listen on <i>interface</i>. If unspecified,  <i>tcpdump</i> searches the system interface list for the lowest numbered, configured up interface (excluding loopback). Ties are broken by choosing the earliest match.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
On Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels, an <i>interface</i> argument of ``any'' can be used to capture packets from all interfaces. Note that captures on the ``any'' device will not be done in promiscuous mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If the <b>-D</b> flag is supported, an interface number as printed by that flag can be used as the <i>interface</i> argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-I</b></dt>
<dd>
Put the interface in &quot;monitor mode&quot;; this is supported only on IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and supported only on some operating systems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the network with which it's associated, so that you will not be able to use any wireless networks with that adapter.  This could prevent accessing files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses, if you are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another network with another adapter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This flag will affect the output of the <b>-L</b> flag.  If <b>-I</b> isn't specified, only those link-layer types available when not in monitor mode will be shown; if <b>-I</b> is specified, only those link-layer types available when in monitor mode will be shown.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-j</b></dt>
<dd>
Set the time stamp type for the capture to <i>tstamp_type</i>.  The names to use for the time stamp types are given in <b>pcap-tstamp-type</b>(7); not all the types listed there will necessarily be valid for any given interface.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-J</b></dt>
<dd>
List the supported time stamp types for the interface and exit.  If the time stamp type cannot be set for the interface, no time stamp types are listed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-K</b></dt>
<dd>
Don't attempt to verify IP, TCP, or UDP checksums.  This is useful for interfaces that perform some or all of those checksum calculation in hardware; otherwise, all outgoing TCP checksums will be flagged as bad.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-l</b></dt>
<dd>
Make stdout line buffered. Useful if you want to see the data while capturing it. E.g.,<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
``tcpdump&#160;&#160;-l&#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160;tee dat'' or ``tcpdump&#160;&#160;-l &#160;&#160;&gt; dat&#160;&#160;&amp;&#160;&#160;tail&#160;&#160;-f&#160;&#160;dat''.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-L</b></dt>
<dd>
List the known data link types for the interface, in the specified mode, and exit.  The list of known data link types may be dependent on the specified mode; for example, on some platforms, a Wi-Fi interface might support one set of data link types when not in monitor mode (for example, it might support only fake Ethernet headers, or might support 802.11 headers but not support 802.11 headers with radio information) and another set of data link types when in monitor mode (for example, it might support 802.11 headers, or 802.11 headers with radio information, only in monitor mode).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-m</b></dt>
<dd>
Load SMI MIB module definitions from file <i>module</i>. This option can be used several times to load several MIB modules into  <i>tcpdump</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-M</b></dt>
<dd>
Use <i>secret</i> as a shared secret for validating the digests found in TCP segments with the TCP-MD5 option (RFC 2385), if present.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-n</b></dt>
<dd>
Don't convert addresses (i.e., host addresses, port numbers, etc.) to names.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-N</b></dt>
<dd>
Don't print domain name qualification of host names. E.g., if you give this flag then  <i>tcpdump</i> will print ``nic'' instead of ``nic.ddn.mil''.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-O</b></dt>
<dd>
Do not run the packet-matching code optimizer. This is useful only if you suspect a bug in the optimizer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-p</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>Don't</i> put the interface into promiscuous mode. Note that the interface might be in promiscuous mode for some other reason; hence, `-p' cannot be used as an abbreviation for `ether host {local-hw-addr} or ether broadcast'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-q</b></dt>
<dd>
Quick (quiet?) output. Print less protocol information so output lines are shorter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-R</b></dt>
<dd>
Assume ESP/AH packets to be based on old specification (RFC1825 to RFC1829). If specified,  <i>tcpdump</i> will not print replay prevention field. Since there is no protocol version field in ESP/AH specification,  <i>tcpdump</i> cannot deduce the version of ESP/AH protocol.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-r</b></dt>
<dd>
Read packets from <i>file</i> (which was created with the <b>-w</b> option). Standard input is used if  <i>file</i> is ``-''.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-S</b></dt>
<dd>
Print absolute, rather than relative, TCP sequence numbers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-s</b></dt>
<dd>
Snarf <i>snaplen</i> bytes of data from each packet rather than the default of 65535 bytes. Packets truncated because of a limited snapshot are indicated in the output with ``[| <i>proto</i>]'', where <i>proto</i> is the name of the protocol level at which the truncation has occurred. Note that taking larger snapshots both increases the amount of time it takes to process packets and, effectively, decreases the amount of packet buffering. This may cause packets to be lost. You should limit  <i>snaplen</i> to the smallest number that will capture the protocol information you're interested in. Setting  <i>snaplen</i> to 0 sets it to the default of 65535, for backwards compatibility with recent older versions of <i>tcpdump</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-T</b></dt>
<dd>
Force packets selected by &quot;<i>expression</i>&quot; to be interpreted the specified  <i>type</i>. Currently known types are  <b>aodv</b> (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector protocol),  <b>cnfp</b> (Cisco NetFlow protocol),  <b>rpc</b> (Remote Procedure Call),  <b>rtp</b> (Real-Time Applications protocol),  <b>rtcp</b> (Real-Time Applications control protocol),  <b>snmp</b> (Simple Network Management Protocol),  <b>tftp</b> (Trivial File Transfer Protocol),  <b>vat</b> (Visual Audio Tool), and  <b>wb</b> (distributed White Board).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-t</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>Don't</i> print a timestamp on each dump line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-tt</b></dt>
<dd>
Print an unformatted timestamp on each dump line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-ttt</b></dt>
<dd>
Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current and previous line on each dump line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-tttt</b></dt>
<dd>
Print a timestamp in default format proceeded by date on each dump line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-ttttt</b></dt>
<dd>
Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current and first line on each dump line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-u</b></dt>
<dd>
Print undecoded NFS handles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-U</b></dt>
<dd>
Make output saved via the <b>-w</b> option ``packet-buffered''; i.e., as each packet is saved, it will be written to the output file, rather than being written only when the output buffer fills.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The <b>-U</b> flag will not be supported if <i>tcpdump</i> was built with an older version of <i>libpcap</i> that lacks the <b>pcap_dump_flush()</b> function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-v</b></dt>
<dd>
When parsing and printing, produce (slightly more) verbose output. For example, the time to live, identification, total length and options in an IP packet are printed. Also enables additional packet integrity checks such as verifying the IP and ICMP header checksum.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When writing to a file with the <b>-w</b> option, report, every 10 seconds, the number of packets captured.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-vv</b></dt>
<dd>
Even more verbose output. For example, additional fields are printed from NFS reply packets, and SMB packets are fully decoded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-vvv</b></dt>
<dd>
Even more verbose output. For example, telnet  <b>SB</b> ... <b>SE</b> options are printed in full. With <b>-X</b> Telnet options are printed in hex as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-w</b></dt>
<dd>
Write the raw packets to <i>file</i> rather than parsing and printing them out. They can later be printed with the -r option. Standard output is used if  <i>file</i> is ``-''. See <b>pcap-savefile</b>(5) for a description of the file format.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-W</b></dt>
<dd>
Used in conjunction with the <b>-C</b> option, this will limit the number of files created to the specified number, and begin overwriting files from the beginning, thus creating a 'rotating' buffer. In addition, it will name the files with enough leading 0s to support the maximum number of files, allowing them to sort correctly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Used in conjunction with the <b>-G</b> option, this will limit the number of rotated dump files that get created, exiting with status 0 when reaching the limit. If used with <b>-C</b> as well, the behavior will result in cyclical files per timeslice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-x</b></dt>
<dd>
When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet (minus its link level header) in hex. The smaller of the entire packet or <i>snaplen</i> bytes will be printed.  Note that this is the entire link-layer packet, so for link layers that pad (e.g. Ethernet), the padding bytes will also be printed when the higher layer packet is shorter than the required padding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-xx</b></dt>
<dd>
When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet, <i>including</i> its link level header, in hex.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-X</b></dt>
<dd>
When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet (minus its link level header) in hex and ASCII. This is very handy for analysing new protocols.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-XX</b></dt>
<dd>
When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet, <i>including</i> its link level header, in hex and ASCII.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-y</b></dt>
<dd>
Set the data link type to use while capturing packets to <i>datalinktype</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-z</b></dt>
<dd>
Used in conjunction with the <b>-C</b> or <b>-G</b> options, this will make <i>tcpdump</i> run &quot; <i>command file</i> &quot; where <i>file</i> is the savefile being closed after each rotation. For example, specifying <b>-z gzip</b> or <b>-z bzip2</b> will compress each savefile using gzip or bzip2.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Note that tcpdump will run the command in parallel to the capture, using the lowest priority so that this doesn't disturb the capture process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
And in case you would like to use a command that itself takes flags or different arguments, you can always write a shell script that will take the savefile name as the only argument, make the flags &amp; arguments arrangements and execute the command that you want.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-Z</b></dt>
<dd>
If <i>tcpdump</i> is running as root, after opening the capture device or input savefile, but before opening any savefiles for output, change the user ID to <i>user</i> and the group ID to the primary group of <i>user</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This behavior can also be enabled by default at compile time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i> expression</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
selects which packets will be dumped. If no  <i>expression</i> is given, all packets on the net will be dumped. Otherwise, only packets for which  <i>expression</i> is `true' will be dumped.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For the <i>expression</i> syntax, see <b>pcap-filter</b>(7).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Expression arguments can be passed to <i>tcpdump</i> as either a single argument or as multiple arguments, whichever is more convenient. Generally, if the expression contains Shell metacharacters, it is easier to pass it as a single, quoted argument. Multiple arguments are concatenated with spaces before being parsed.</div>

<h1>OUTPUT FORMAT</h1> The output of  <i>tcpdump</i> is protocol dependent. The following gives a brief description and examples of most of the formats.<div style="height: 1.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Link Level Headers</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
If the '-e' option is given, the link level header is printed out. On Ethernets, the source and destination addresses, protocol, and packet length are printed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On FDDI networks, the  '-e' option causes <i>tcpdump</i> to print the `frame control' field,  the source and destination addresses, and the packet length. (The `frame control' field governs the interpretation of the rest of the packet. Normal packets (such as those containing IP datagrams) are `async' packets, with a priority value between 0 and 7; for example, ` <b>async4</b>'. Such packets are assumed to contain an 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) packet; the LLC header is printed if it is  <i>not</i> an ISO datagram or a so-called SNAP packet.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On Token Ring networks, the '-e' option causes <i>tcpdump</i> to print the `access control' and `frame control' fields, the source and destination addresses, and the packet length. As on FDDI networks, packets are assumed to contain an LLC packet. Regardless of whether the '-e' option is specified or not, the source routing information is printed for source-routed packets.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On 802.11 networks, the '-e' option causes <i>tcpdump</i> to print the `frame control' fields, all of the addresses in the 802.11 header, and the packet length. As on FDDI networks, packets are assumed to contain an LLC packet.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>(N.B.: The following description assumes familiarity with</i>  <i>the SLIP compression algorithm described in RFC-1144.)</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
On SLIP links, a direction indicator (``I'' for inbound, ``O'' for outbound), packet type, and compression information are printed out. The packet type is printed first. The three types are  <i>ip</i>, <i>utcp</i>, and <i>ctcp</i>. No further link information is printed for  <i>ip</i> packets. For TCP packets, the connection identifier is printed following the type. If the packet is compressed, its encoded header is printed out. The special cases are printed out as  <b>*S+</b><i>n</i> and <b>*SA+</b><i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is the amount by which the sequence number (or sequence number and ack) has changed. If it is not a special case, zero or more changes are printed. A change is indicated by U (urgent pointer), W (window), A (ack), S (sequence number), and I (packet ID), followed by a delta (+n or -n), or a new value (=n). Finally, the amount of data in the packet and compressed header length are printed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, the following line shows an outbound compressed TCP packet, with an implicit connection identifier; the ack has changed by 6, the sequence number by 49, and the packet ID by 6; there are 3 bytes of data and 6 bytes of compressed header:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>O ctcp * A+6 S+49 I+6 3 (6)</b><br/>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>ARP/RARP Packets</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
Arp/rarp output shows the type of request and its arguments. The format is intended to be self explanatory. Here is a short sample taken from the start of an `rlogin' from host  <i>rtsg</i> to host <i>csam</i>:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
arp who-has csam tell rtsg<br/>
arp reply csam is-at CSAM<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
The first line says that rtsg sent an arp packet asking for the Ethernet address of internet host csam. Csam replies with its Ethernet address (in this example, Ethernet addresses are in caps and internet addresses in lower case).<div class="spacer">
</div>
This would look less redundant if we had done <i>tcpdump -n</i>:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
arp who-has 128.3.254.6 tell 128.3.254.68<br/>
arp reply 128.3.254.6 is-at 02:07:01:00:01:c4<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If we had done <i>tcpdump -e</i>, the fact that the first packet is broadcast and the second is point-to-point would be visible:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>

CSAM RTSG 0806  64: arp reply csam is-at CSAM<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
For the first packet this says the Ethernet source address is RTSG, the destination is the Ethernet broadcast address, the type field contained hex 0806 (type ETHER_ARP) and the total length was 64 bytes.<div style="height: 1.50em;">

<b>TCP Packets</b><div class="spacer">

<i>(N.B.:The following description assumes familiarity with</i>  <i>the TCP protocol described in RFC-793.</i>  <i>If you are not familiar</i>  <i>with the protocol, neither this description nor </i><i>tcpdump</i><i> will</i>  <i>be of much use to you.)</i><i></i><div class="spacer">
</div>
The general format of a tcp protocol line is:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<i>src &gt; dst: flags data-seqno ack window urgent options</i><div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
<i>Src</i> and <i>dst</i> are the source and destination IP addresses and ports.  <i>Flags</i> are some combination of S (SYN), F (FIN), P (PUSH), R (RST), U (URG), W (ECN CWR), E (ECN-Echo) or `.' (ACK), or `none' if no flags are set.  <i>Data-seqno</i> describes the portion of sequence space covered by the data in this packet (see example below).  <i>Ack</i> is sequence number of the next data expected the other direction on this connection.  <i>Window</i> is the number of bytes of receive buffer space available the other direction on this connection.  <i>Urg</i> indicates there is `urgent' data in the packet.  <i>Options</i> are tcp options enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., &lt;mss 1024&gt;).<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Src, dst</i> and <i>flags</i> are always present. The other fields depend on the contents of the packet's tcp protocol header and are output only if appropriate.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Here is the opening portion of an rlogin from host <i>rtsg</i> to host  <i>csam</i>.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>

&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
The first line says that tcp port 1023 on rtsg sent a packet to port  <i>login</i> on csam. The  <b>S</b> indicates that the <i>SYN</i> flag was set. The packet sequence number was 768512 and it contained no data. (The notation is `first:last(nbytes)' which means `sequence numbers  <i>first</i> up to but not including  <i>last</i> which is <i>nbytes</i> bytes of user data'.) There was no piggy-backed ack, the available receive window was 4096 bytes and there was a max-segment-size option requesting an mss of 1024 bytes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Csam replies with a similar packet except it includes a piggy-backed ack for rtsg's SYN. Rtsg then acks csam's SYN. The `.' means the ACK flag was set. The packet contained no data so there is no data sequence number. Note that the ack sequence number is a small integer (1). The first time  <i>tcpdump</i> sees a tcp `conversation', it prints the sequence number from the packet. On subsequent packets of the conversation, the difference between the current packet's sequence number and this initial sequence number is printed. This means that sequence numbers after the first can be interpreted as relative byte positions in the conversation's data stream (with the first data byte each direction being `1'). `-S' will override this feature, causing the original sequence numbers to be output.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On the 6th line, rtsg sends csam 19 bytes of data (bytes 2 through 20 in the rtsg &#8594; csam side of the conversation). The PUSH flag is set in the packet. On the 7th line, csam says it's received data sent by rtsg up to but not including byte 21. Most of this data is apparently sitting in the socket buffer since csam's receive window has gotten 19 bytes smaller. Csam also sends one byte of data to rtsg in this packet. On the 8th and 9th lines, csam sends two bytes of urgent, pushed data to rtsg.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the snapshot was small enough that <i>tcpdump</i> didn't capture the full TCP header, it interprets as much of the header as it can and then reports ``[| <i>tcp</i>]'' to indicate the remainder could not be interpreted. If the header contains a bogus option (one with a length that's either too small or beyond the end of the header),  <i>tcpdump</i> reports it as ``[ <i>bad opt</i>]'' and does not interpret any further options (since it's impossible to tell where they start). If the header length indicates options are present but the IP datagram length is not long enough for the options to actually be there,  <i>tcpdump</i> reports it as ``[ <i>bad hdr length</i>]''.<div style="height: 1.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Capturing TCP packets with particular flag combinations (SYN-ACK, URG-ACK, etc.)</b><div class="spacer">

There are 8 bits in the control bits section of the TCP header:<dl>
<dt>

<dd>
<i>CWR | ECE | URG | ACK | PSH | RST | SYN | FIN</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Let's assume that we want to watch packets used in establishing a TCP connection. Recall that TCP uses a 3-way handshake protocol when it initializes a new connection; the connection sequence with regard to the TCP control bits is<div class="spacer">

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

2) Recipient responds with SYN, ACK</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
3) Caller sends ACK</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now we're interested in capturing packets that have only the SYN bit set (Step 1). Note that we don't want packets from step 2 (SYN-ACK), just a plain initial SYN. What we need is a correct filter expression for  <i>tcpdump</i>.<div class="spacer">

Recall the structure of a TCP header without options:<div class="spacer">

A TCP header usually holds 20 octets of data, unless options are present. The first line of the graph contains octets 0 - 3, the second line shows octets 4 - 7 etc.<div class="spacer">

These are the TCP control bits we are interested in. We have numbered the bits in this octet from 0 to 7, right to left, so the PSH bit is bit number 3, while the URG bit is number 5.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Recall that we want to capture packets with only SYN set. Let's see what happens to octet 13 if a TCP datagram arrives with the SYN bit set in its header:<div class="spacer">

                |C|E|U|A|P|R|S|F|<br/>

                |7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0|<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Looking at the control bits section we see that only bit number 1 (SYN) is set.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Assuming that octet number 13 is an 8-bit unsigned integer in network byte order, the binary value of this octet is<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
00000010</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">

<div class="spacer">
</div>
We're almost done, because now we know that if only SYN is set, the value of the 13th octet in the TCP header, when interpreted as a 8-bit unsigned integer in network byte order, must be exactly 2.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This relationship can be expressed as<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<b>tcp[13] == 2</b></div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
We can use this expression as the filter for <i>tcpdump</i> in order to watch packets which have only SYN set:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<b>tcpdump -i xl0 tcp[13] == 2</b></div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The expression says &quot;let the 13th octet of a TCP datagram have the decimal value 2&quot;, which is exactly what we want.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now, let's assume that we need to capture SYN packets, but we don't care if ACK or any other TCP control bit is set at the same time. Let's see what happens to octet 13 when a TCP datagram with SYN-ACK set arrives:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
     |C|E|U|A|P|R|S|F|<br/>
     |---------------|<br/>

     |---------------|<br/>
     |7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0|<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now bits 1 and 4 are set in the 13th octet. The binary value of octet 13 is<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<br/>
     00010010</dd>

0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 1*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 1*2 + 0*2   = 18<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now we can't just use 'tcp[13] == 18' in the <i>tcpdump</i> filter expression, because that would select only those packets that have SYN-ACK set, but not those with only SYN set. Remember that we don't care if ACK or any other control bit is set as long as SYN is set.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In order to achieve our goal, we need to logically AND the binary value of octet 13 with some other value to preserve the SYN bit. We know that we want SYN to be set in any case, so we'll logically AND the value in the 13th octet with the binary value of a SYN:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
          00010010 SYN-ACK              00000010 SYN<br/>
     AND  00000010 (we want SYN)   AND  00000010 (we want SYN)<br/>
          --------                      --------<br/>
     =    00000010                 =    00000010<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
We see that this AND operation delivers the same result regardless whether ACK or another TCP control bit is set. The decimal representation of the AND value as well as the result of this operation is 2 (binary 00000010), so we know that for packets with SYN set the following relation must hold true:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
( ( value of octet 13 ) AND ( 2 ) ) == ( 2 )</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This points us to the <i>tcpdump</i> filter expression<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

Other flag characters that might appear are `-' (recursion available, RA,  <i>not</i> set) and `|' (truncated message, TC, set). If the `question' section doesn't contain exactly one entry, `[ <i>n</i>q]' is printed.<div style="height: 1.50em;">

<b>SMB/CIFS decoding</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>tcpdump</i> now includes fairly extensive SMB/CIFS/NBT decoding for data on UDP/137, UDP/138 and TCP/139. Some primitive decoding of IPX and NetBEUI SMB data is also done.<div class="spacer">
</div>
By default a fairly minimal decode is done, with a much more detailed decode done if -v is used. Be warned that with -v a single SMB packet may take up a page or more, so only use -v if you really want all the gory details.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For information on SMB packet formats and what all the fields mean see www.cifs.org or the pub/samba/specs/ directory on your favorite samba.org mirror site. The SMB patches were written by Andrew Tridgell (tridge@samba.org).<div style="height: 1.50em;">

<b>NFS Requests and Replies</b><div class="spacer">

<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
In the first line, host <i>sushi</i> sends a transaction with id <i>6709</i> to  <i>wrl</i> (note that the number following the src host is a transaction id,  <i>not</i> the source port). The request was 112 bytes, excluding the UDP and IP headers. The operation was a  <i>readlink</i> (read symbolic link) on file handle ( <i>fh</i>) 21,24/10.731657119. (If one is lucky, as in this case, the file handle can be interpreted as a major,minor device number pair, followed by the inode number and generation number.)  <i>Wrl</i> replies `ok' with the contents of the link.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the third line, <i>sushi</i> asks <i>wrl</i> to lookup the name ` <i>xcolors</i>' in directory file 9,74/4096.6878. Note that the data printed depends on the operation type. The format is intended to be self explanatory if read in conjunction with an NFS protocol spec.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the -v (verbose) flag is given, additional information is printed. For example:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<br/>
sushi.1372a &gt; wrl.nfs:<br/>

<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
(-v also prints the IP header TTL, ID, length, and fragmentation fields, which have been omitted from this example.)  In the first line,  <i>sushi</i> asks <i>wrl</i> to read 8192 bytes from file 21,11/12.195, at byte offset 24576.  <i>Wrl</i> replies `ok'; the packet shown on the second line is the first fragment of the reply, and hence is only 1472 bytes long (the other bytes will follow in subsequent fragments, but these fragments do not have NFS or even UDP headers and so might not be printed, depending on the filter expression used). Because the -v flag is given, some of the file attributes (which are returned in addition to the file data) are printed: the file type (``REG'', for regular file), the file mode (in octal), the uid and gid, and the file size.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the -v flag is given more than once, even more details are printed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that NFS requests are very large and much of the detail won't be printed unless  <i>snaplen</i> is increased. Try using ` <b>-s 192</b>' to watch NFS traffic.<div class="spacer">
</div>
NFS reply packets do not explicitly identify the RPC operation. Instead,  <i>tcpdump</i> keeps track of ``recent'' requests, and matches them to the replies using the transaction ID. If a reply does not closely follow the corresponding request, it might not be parsable.<div style="height: 1.50em;">

pike.afsfs &gt; elvis.7001: rx data fs reply rename<br/>
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
In the first line, host elvis sends a RX packet to pike. This was a RX data packet to the fs (fileserver) service, and is the start of an RPC call. The RPC call was a rename, with the old directory file id of 536876964/1/1 and an old filename of `.newsrc.new', and a new directory file id of 536876964/1/1 and a new filename of `.newsrc'. The host pike responds with a RPC reply to the rename call (which was successful, because it was a data packet and not an abort packet).<div class="spacer">
</div>
In general, all AFS RPCs are decoded at least by RPC call name. Most AFS RPCs have at least some of the arguments decoded (generally only the `interesting' arguments, for some definition of interesting).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The format is intended to be self-describing, but it will probably not be useful to people who are not familiar with the workings of AFS and RX.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the -v (verbose) flag is given twice, acknowledgement packets and additional header information is printed, such as the the RX call ID, call number, sequence number, serial number, and the RX packet flags.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the -v flag is given twice, additional information is printed, such as the the RX call ID, serial number, and the RX packet flags. The MTU negotiation information is also printed from RX ack packets.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the -v flag is given three times, the security index and service id are printed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Error codes are printed for abort packets, with the exception of Ubik beacon packets (because abort packets are used to signify a yes vote for the Ubik protocol).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that AFS requests are very large and many of the arguments won't be printed unless  <i>snaplen</i> is increased. Try using ` <b>-s 256</b>' to watch AFS traffic.<div class="spacer">
</div>
AFS reply packets do not explicitly identify the RPC operation. Instead,  <i>tcpdump</i> keeps track of ``recent'' requests, and matches them to the replies using the call number and service ID. If a reply does not closely follow the corresponding request, it might not be parsable.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<b>KIP AppleTalk (DDP in UDP)</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
AppleTalk DDP packets encapsulated in UDP datagrams are de-encapsulated and dumped as DDP packets (i.e., all the UDP header information is discarded). The file <i>/etc/atalk.names</i> is used to translate AppleTalk net and node numbers to names. Lines in this file have the form<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<i>number	name</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
1.254		ether<br/>
16.1		icsd-net<br/>
1.254.110	ace<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
The first two lines give the names of AppleTalk networks. The third line gives the name of a particular host (a host is distinguished from a net by the 3rd octet in the number - a net number  <i>must</i> have two octets and a host number <i>must</i> have three octets.)  The number and name should be separated by whitespace (blanks or tabs). The <i>/etc/atalk.names</i> file may contain blank lines or comment lines (lines starting with a `#').<div class="spacer">
</div>
AppleTalk addresses are printed in the form<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<i>net.host.port</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
144.1.209.2 &gt; icsd-net.112.220<br/>

jssmag.149.235 &gt; icsd-net.2<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
(If the <i>/etc/atalk.names</i> doesn't exist or doesn't contain an entry for some AppleTalk host/net number, addresses are printed in numeric form.) In the first example, NBP (DDP port 2) on net 144.1 node 209 is sending to whatever is listening on port 220 of net icsd node 112. The second line is the same except the full name of the source node is known (`office'). The third line is a send from port 235 on net jssmag node 149 to broadcast on the icsd-net NBP port (note that the broadcast address (255) is indicated by a net name with no host number - for this reason it's a good idea to keep node names and net names distinct in /etc/atalk.names).<div class="spacer">
</div>
NBP (name binding protocol) and ATP (AppleTalk transaction protocol) packets have their contents interpreted. Other protocols just dump the protocol name (or number if no name is registered for the protocol) and packet size.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>NBP packets</b> are formatted like the following examples:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
icsd-net.112.220 &gt; jssmag.2: nbp-lkup 190: &quot;=:LaserWriter@*&quot;<br/>
jssmag.209.2 &gt; icsd-net.112.220: nbp-reply 190: &quot;RM1140:LaserWriter@*&quot; 250<br/>
techpit.2 &gt; icsd-net.112.220: nbp-reply 190: &quot;techpit:LaserWriter@*&quot; 186<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
The first line is a name lookup request for laserwriters sent by net icsd host 112 and broadcast on net jssmag. The nbp id for the lookup is 190. The second line shows a reply for this request (note that it has the same id) from host jssmag.209 saying that it has a laserwriter resource named &quot;RM1140&quot; registered on port 250. The third line is another reply to the same request saying host techpit has laserwriter &quot;techpit&quot; registered on port 186.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>ATP packet</b> formatting is demonstrated by the following example:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
Jssmag.209 initiates transaction id 12266 with host helios by requesting up to 8 packets (the `&lt;0-7&gt;'). The hex number at the end of the line is the value of the `userdata' field in the request.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Helios responds with 8 512-byte packets. The `:digit' following the transaction id gives the packet sequence number in the transaction and the number in parens is the amount of data in the packet, excluding the atp header. The `*' on packet 7 indicates that the EOM bit was set.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Jssmag.209 then requests that packets 3 &amp; 5 be retransmitted. Helios resends them then jssmag.209 releases the transaction. Finally, jssmag.209 initiates the next request. The `*' on the request indicates that XO (`exactly once') was  <i>not</i> set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="height: 1.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>IP Fragmentation</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
Fragmented Internet datagrams are printed as<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<b>(frag </b><i>id</i><b>:</b><i>size</i><b>@</b><i>offset</i><b>+)</b><br/>
<b>(frag </b><i>id</i><b>:</b><i>size</i><b>@</b><i>offset</i><b>)</b><div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
(The first form indicates there are more fragments. The second indicates this is the last fragment.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Id</i> is the fragment id.  <i>Size</i> is the fragment size (in bytes) excluding the IP header.  <i>Offset</i> is this fragment's offset (in bytes) in the original datagram.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The fragment information is output for each fragment. The first fragment contains the higher level protocol header and the frag info is printed after the protocol info. Fragments after the first contain no higher level protocol header and the frag info is printed after the source and destination addresses. For example, here is part of an ftp from arizona.edu to lbl-rtsg.arpa over a CSNET connection that doesn't appear to handle 576 byte datagrams:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
arizona.ftp-data &gt; rtsg.1170: . 1024:1332(308) ack 1 win 4096 (frag 595a:328@0+)<br/>
arizona &gt; rtsg: (frag 595a:204@328)<br/>
rtsg.1170 &gt; arizona.ftp-data: . ack 1536 win 2560<div style="height: 0.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
</div>
There are a couple of things to note here:  First, addresses in the 2nd line don't include port numbers. This is because the TCP protocol information is all in the first fragment and we have no idea what the port or sequence numbers are when we print the later fragments. Second, the tcp sequence information in the first line is printed as if there were 308 bytes of user data when, in fact, there are 512 bytes (308 in the first frag and 204 in the second). If you are looking for holes in the sequence space or trying to match up acks with packets, this can fool you.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A packet with the IP <i>don't fragment</i> flag is marked with a trailing  <b>(DF)</b>.<div style="height: 1.50em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Timestamps</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
By default, all output lines are preceded by a timestamp. The timestamp is the current clock time in the form<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<i>hh:mm:ss.frac</i><br/>
</div>
and is as accurate as the kernel's clock. The timestamp reflects the time the kernel first saw the packet. No attempt is made to account for the time lag between when the Ethernet interface removed the packet from the wire and when the kernel serviced the `new packet' interrupt.</div>
