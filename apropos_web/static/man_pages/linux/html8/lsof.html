<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <i>Lsof</i> revision 4.81 lists on its standard output file information about files opened by processes for the following UNIX dialects:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
	AIX 5.3<br/>
	FreeBSD 4.9 for x86-based systems<br/>
	FreeBSD 7.0 and 8.0 for AMD64-based systems<br/>
	Linux 2.1.72 and above for x86-based systems<br/>
	Solaris 9 and 10<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
(See the <b>DISTRIBUTION</b> section of this manual page for information on how to obtain the latest <i>lsof</i> revision.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
An open file may be a regular file, a directory, a block special file, a character special file, an executing text reference, a library, a stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or UNIX domain socket.) A specific file or all the files in a file system may be selected by path.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Instead of a formatted display, <i>lsof</i> will produce output that can be parsed by other programs. See the <b>-F</b>, option description, and the <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b> section for more information.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In addition to producing a single output list, <i>lsof</i> will run in repeat mode. In repeat mode it will produce output, delay, then repeat the output operation until stopped with an interrupt or quit signal. See the <b>+|-r</b><i> [t[m&lt;fmt&gt;]]</i> option description for more information.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> In the absence of any options, <i>lsof</i> lists all open files belonging to all active processes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If any list request option is specified, other list requests must be specifically requested - e.g., if <b>-U</b> is specified for the listing of UNIX socket files, NFS files won't be listed unless <b>-N</b> is also specified; or if a user list is specified with the <b>-u</b> option, UNIX domain socket files, belonging to users not in the list, won't be listed unless the <b>-U</b> option is also specified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Normally list options that are specifically stated are ORed - i.e., specifying the <b>-i</b> option without an address and the  <b>-u</b>foo option produces a listing of all network files OR files belonging to processes owned by user ``foo''. The exceptions are:<dl>
<dt>
1)</dt>
<dd>
the `^' (negated) login name or user ID (UID), specified with the <b>-u</b> option;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2)</dt>
<dd>
the `^' (negated) process ID (PID), specified with the <b>-p</b> option;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
3)</dt>
<dd>
the `^' (negated) process group ID (PGID), specified with the <b>-g</b> option;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
4)</dt>
<dd>
the `^' (negated) command, specified with the <b>-c</b> option;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
5)</dt>
<dd>
the ('^') negated TCP or UDP protocol state names, specified with the <b>-s</b><i> [p:s]</i> option.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since they represent exclusions, they are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect before any other selection criteria are applied.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-a</b> option may be used to AND the selections. For example, specifying <b>-a</b>, <b>-U</b>, and  <b>-u</b>foo produces a listing of only UNIX socket files that belong to processes owned by user ``foo''.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Caution: the <b>-a</b> option causes all list selection options to be ANDed; it can't be used to cause ANDing of selected pairs of selection options by placing it between them, even though its placement there is acceptable. Wherever <b>-a</b> is placed, it causes the ANDing of all selection options.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Items of the same selection set - command names, file descriptors, network addresses, process identifiers, user identifiers, zone names, security contexts - are joined in a single ORed set and applied before the result participates in ANDing. Thus, for example, specifying  <b>-i</b>@aaa.bbb, <b>-i</b>@ccc.ddd, <b>-a</b>, and  <b>-u</b>fff,ggg will select the listing of files that belong to either login ``fff'' OR ``ggg'' AND have network connections to either host aaa.bbb OR ccc.ddd.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Options may be grouped together following a single prefix -- e.g., the option set `` <b>-a -b -C</b>'' may be stated as <b>-abC</b>. However, since values are optional following <b>+|-f</b>, <b>-F</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>+|-L</b>, <b>-o</b>, <b>+|-r</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-S</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>-x</b> and <b>-z</b>. when you have no values for them be careful that the following character isn't ambiguous. For example, <b>-Fn</b> might represent the <b>-F</b> and <b>-n</b> options, or it might represent the <b>n</b> field identifier character following the <b>-F</b> option. When ambiguity is possible, start a new option with a `-' character - e.g., `` <b>-F -n</b>''. If the next option is a file name, follow the possibly ambiguous option with ``--'' - e.g., `` <b>-F -- </b><i>name</i>''.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Either the `+' or the `-' prefix may be applied to a group of options. Options that don't take on separate meanings for each prefix - e.g.,  <b>-i</b> - may be grouped under either prefix. Thus, for example, ``+M -i'' may be stated as ``+Mi'' and the group means the same as the separate options. Be careful of prefix grouping when one or more options in the group does take on separate meanings under different prefixes - e.g.,  <b>+|-M</b>; ``-iM'' is not the same request as ``-i +M''. When in doubt, use separate options with appropriate prefixes.<dl>
<dt>
<b>-? -h</b></dt>
<dd>
These two equivalent options select a usage (help) output list. <i>Lsof</i> displays a shortened form of this output when it detects an error in the options supplied to it, after it has displayed messages explaining each error. (Escape the `?' character as your shell requires.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-a</b></dt>
<dd>
This option causes list selection options to be ANDed, as described above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-A</b><i> A</i></dt>
<dd>
This option is available on systems configured for AFS whose AFS kernel code is implemented via dynamic modules. It allows the <i>lsof</i> user to specify <i>A</i> as an alternate name list file where the kernel addresses of the dynamic modules might be found. See the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information about dynamic modules, their symbols, and how they affect <i>lsof</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-b</b></dt>
<dd>
This option causes <i>lsof</i> to avoid kernel functions that might block - <i>lstat</i>(2), <i>readlink</i>(2), and <i>stat</i>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
See the <b>BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS</b> and <b>AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS</b> sections for information on using this option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-c</b><i> c</i></dt>
<dd>
This option selects the listing of files for processes executing the command that begins with the characters of <i>c</i>. Multiple commands may be specified, using multiple <b>-c</b> options. They are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If <i>c</i> begins with a '^', then the following characters specify a command name whose processes are to be ignored (excluded.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If <i>c</i> begins and ends with a slash ('/'), the characters between the slashes are interpreted as a regular expression. Shell meta-characters in the regular expression must be quoted to prevent their interpretation by the shell. The closing slash may be followed by these modifiers:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<br/>
	b	the regular expression is a basic one.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
	i	ignore the case of letters.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
	x	the regular expression is an extended one<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
		(default).<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
See the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information on basic and extended regular expressions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The simple command specification is tested first. If that test fails, the command regular expression is applied. If the simple command test succeeds, the command regular expression test isn't made. This may result in ``no command found for regex:'' messages when lsof's <b>-V</b> option is specified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>+c</b><i> w</i></dt>
<dd>
This option defines the maximum number of initial characters of the name, supplied by the UNIX dialect, of the UNIX command associated with a process to be printed in the COMMAND column. (The <i>lsof</i> default is nine.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Note that many UNIX dialects do not supply all command name characters to <i>lsof</i> in the files and structures from which <i>lsof</i> obtains command name. Often dialects limit the number of characters supplied in those sources. For example, Linux 2.4.27 and Solaris 9 both limit command name length to 16 characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If <i>w</i> is zero ('0'), all command characters supplied to <i>lsof</i> by the UNIX dialect will be printed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If <i>w</i> is less than the length of the column title, ``COMMAND'', it will be raised to that length.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-C</b></dt>
<dd>
This option disables the reporting of any path name components from the kernel's name cache. See the <b>KERNEL NAME CACHE</b> section for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>+d</b><i> s</i></dt>
<dd>
This option causes <i>lsof</i> to search for all open instances of directory <i>s</i> and the files and directories it contains at its top level. This option does NOT descend the directory tree, rooted at <i>s</i>. The <b>+D</b><i> D</i> option may be used to request a full-descent directory tree search, rooted at directory <i>D</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Processing of the <b>+d</b> option does not follow symbolic links within <i>s</i> unless the <b>-x</b> or <b>-x  l</b> option is also specified. Nor does it search for open files on file system mount points on subdirectories of <i>s</i> unless the <b>-x</b> or <b>-x  f</b> option is also specified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Note: the authority of the user of this option limits it to searching for files that the user has permission to examine with the system <i>stat</i>(2) function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-d</b><i> s</i></dt>
<dd>
This option specifies a list of file descriptors (FDs) to exclude from or include in the output listing. The file descriptors are specified in the comma-separated set <i>s</i> - e.g., ``cwd,1,3'', ``^6,^2''. (There should be no spaces in the set.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The list is an exclusion list if all entries of the set begin with '^'. It is an inclusion list if no entry begins with '^'. Mixed lists are not permitted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
A file descriptor number range may be in the set as long as neither member is empty, both members are numbers, and the ending member is larger than the starting one - e.g., ``0-7'' or ``3-10''. Ranges may be specified for exclusion if they have the '^' prefix - e.g., ``^0-7'' excludes all file descriptors 0 through 7.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Multiple file descriptor numbers are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When there are exclusion and inclusion members in the set, <i>lsof</i> reports them as errors and exits with a non-zero return code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
See the description of File Descriptor (FD) output values in the <b>OUTPUT</b> section for more information on file descriptor names.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>+D</b><i> D</i></dt>
<dd>
This option causes <i>lsof</i> to search for all open instances of directory <i>D</i> and all the files and directories it contains to its complete depth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Processing of the <b>+D</b> option does not follow symbolic links within <i>D</i> unless the <b>-x</b> or <b>-x  l</b> option is also specified. Nor does it search for open files on file system mount points on subdirectories of <i>D</i> unless the <b>-x</b> or <b>-x  f</b> option is also specified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Note: the authority of the user of this option limits it to searching for files that the user has permission to examine with the system <i>stat</i>(2) function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Further note: <i>lsof</i> may process this option slowly and require a large amount of dynamic memory to do it. This is because it must descend the entire directory tree, rooted at <i>D</i>, calling <i>stat</i>(2) for each file and directory, building a list of all the files it finds, and searching that list for a match with every open file. When directory <i>D</i> is large, these steps can take a long time, so use this option prudently.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-D</b><i> D</i></dt>
<dd>
This option directs <i>lsof's</i> use of the device cache file. The use of this option is sometimes restricted. See the <b>DEVICE CACHE FILE</b> section and the sections that follow it for more information on this option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<b>-D</b> must be followed by a function letter; the function letter may optionally be followed by a path name. <i>Lsof</i> recognizes these function letters:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<br/>
	<b>?</b> - report device cache file paths<br/>
	<b>b</b> - build the device cache file<br/>
	<b>i</b> - ignore the device cache file<br/>
	<b>r</b> - read the device cache file<br/>
	<b>u</b> - read and update the device cache file<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions, accompanied by a path name, are sometimes restricted. When these functions are restricted, they will not appear in the description of the <b>-D</b> option that accompanies <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option output. See the <b>DEVICE CACHE FILE</b> section and the sections that follow it for more information on these functions and when they're restricted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The <b>?</b> function reports the read-only and write paths that lsof can use for the device cache file, the names of any environment variables whose values <i>lsof</i> will examine when forming the device cache file path, and the format for the personal device cache file path. (Escape the `?' character as your shell requires.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When available, the <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions may be followed by the device cache file's path. The standard default is <i>.lsof_hostname</i> in the home directory of the real user ID that executes <i>lsof</i>, but this could have been changed when <i>lsof</i> was configured and compiled. (The output of the <b>-h</b> and <b>-?</b> options show the current default prefix - e.g., ``.lsof''.) The suffix, <i>hostname</i>, is the first component of the host's name returned by <i>gethostname</i>(2)<i>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When available, the <b>b</b> function directs <i>lsof</i> to build a new device cache file at the default or specified path.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The <b>i</b> function directs <i>lsof</i> to ignore the default device cache file and obtain its information about devices via direct calls to the kernel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The <b>r</b> function directs <i>lsof</i> to read the device cache at the default or specified path, but prevents it from creating a new device cache file when none exists or the existing one is improperly structured. The <b>r</b> function, when specified without a path name, prevents <i>lsof</i> from updating an incorrect or outdated device cache file, or creating a new one in its place. The <b>r</b> function is always available when it is specified without a path name argument; it may be restricted by the permissions of the <i>lsof</i> process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When available, the <b>u</b> function directs <i>lsof</i> to read the device cache file at the default or specified path, if possible, and to rebuild it, if necessary. This is the default device cache file function when no <b>-D</b> option has been specified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>+|-f [cfgGn]</b></dt>
<dd>
<b>f</b> by itself clarifies how path name arguments are to be interpreted. When followed by <b>c</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, or <b>n</b> in any combination it specifies that the listing of kernel file structure information is to be enabled (`+') or inhibited (`-').</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Normally a path name argument is taken to be a file system name if it matches a mounted-on directory name reported by <i>mount</i>(8), or if it represents a block device, named in the <i>mount</i> output and associated with a mounted directory name. When <b>+f</b> is specified, all path name arguments will be taken to be file system names, and <i>lsof</i> will complain if any are not. This can be useful, for example, when the file system name (mounted-on device) isn't a block device. This happens for some CD-ROM file systems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When <b>-f</b> is specified by itself, all path name arguments will be taken to be simple files. Thus, for example, the `` <b>-f</b>&#160;-- /'' arguments direct lsof to search for open files with a `/' path name, not all open files in the `/' (root) file system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Be careful to make sure <b>+f</b> and <b>-f</b> are properly terminated and aren't followed by a character (e.g., of the file or file system name) that might be taken as a parameter. For example, use ``--'' after <b>+f</b> and <b>-f</b> as in these examples.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<br/>
	$ lsof +f -- /file/system/name<br/>
	$ lsof -f -- /file/name<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The listing of information from kernel file structures, requested with the <b>+f [cfgGn]</b> option form, is normally inhibited, and is not available in whole or part for some dialects - e.g., /proc-based Linux kernels below 2.6.22. When the prefix to <b>f</b> is a plus sign (`+'), these characters request file structure information:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<br/>
	<b>c</b>	file structure use count (not Linux)<br/>
	<b>f</b>	file structure address (not Linux)<br/>
	<b>g</b>	file flag abbreviations (Linux 2.6.22 and up)<br/>
	<b>G</b>	file flags in hexadecimal (Linux 2.6.22 and up)<br/>
	<b>n</b>	file structure node address (not Linux)<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When the prefix is minus (`-') the same characters disable the listing of the indicated values.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
File structure addresses, use counts, flags, and node addresses may be used to detect more readily identical files inherited by child processes and identical files in use by different processes. <i>Lsof</i> column output can be sorted by output columns holding the values and listed to identify identical file use, or <i>lsof</i> field output can be parsed by an AWK or Perl post-filter script, or by a C program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-F</b><i> f</i></dt>
<dd>
This option specifies a character list, <i>f</i>, that selects the fields to be output for processing by another program, and the character that terminates each output field. Each field to be output is specified with a single character in <i>f</i>. The field terminator defaults to NL, but may be changed to NUL (000). See the <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b> section for a description of the field identification characters and the field output process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When the field selection character list is empty, all standard fields are selected (except the raw device field, security context and zone field for compatibility reasons) and the NL field terminator is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When the field selection character list contains only a zero (`0'), all fields are selected (except the raw device field for compatibility reasons) and the NUL terminator character is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Other combinations of fields and their associated field terminator character must be set with explicit entries in <i>f</i>, as described in the <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b> section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When a field selection character identifies an item <i>lsof</i> does not normally list - e.g., PPID, selected with <b>-R</b> - specification of the field character - e.g., `` <b>-FR</b>'' - also selects the listing of the item.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When the field selection character list contains the single character `?', <i>lsof</i> will display a help list of the field identification characters. (Escape the `?' character as your shell requires.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-g</b><i> [s]</i></dt>
<dd>
This option excludes or selects the listing of files for the processes whose optional process group IDentification (PGID) numbers are in the comma-separated set <i>s</i> - e.g., ``123'' or ``123,^456''. (There should be no spaces in the set.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
PGID numbers that begin with `^' (negation) represent exclusions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Multiple PGID numbers are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection. However, PGID exclusions are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect before other selection criteria are applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The <b>-g</b> option also enables the output display of PGID numbers. When specified without a PGID set that's all it does.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-i</b><i> [i]</i></dt>
<dd>
This option selects the listing of files any of whose Internet address matches the address specified in  <i>i</i>. If no address is specified, this option selects the listing of all Internet and x.25 (HP-UX) network files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If <b>-i</b><i>4</i> or <b>-i</b><i>6</i> is specified with no following address, only files of the indicated IP version, IPv4 or IPv6, are displayed. (An IPv6 specification may be used only if the dialects supports IPv6, as indicated by ``[46]'' and ``IPv[46]'' in <i>lsof's</i> <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> output.) Sequentially specifying <b>-i</b>4, followed by <b>-i</b>6 is the same as specifying <b>-i</b>, and vice-versa. Specifying <b>-i</b>4, or <b>-i</b>6 after <b>-i</b> is the same as specifying <b>-i</b>4 or <b>-i</b>6 by itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Multiple addresses (up to a limit of 100) may be specified with multiple <b>-i</b> options. (A port number or service name range is counted as one address.) They are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

<dd>
An Internet address is specified in the form (Items in square brackets are optional.):</dd>

When <b>+L</b> is followed by a number, only files having a link count less than that number will be listed. (No number may follow <b>-L</b>.) A specification of the form `` <b>+L1</b>'' will select open files that have been unlinked.

<dd>
This option specifies an alternate kernel memory file or activates mount table supplement processing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

Note: the <b>+m</b> and <b>+m</b><i> m</i> options are not available for all supported dialects. Check the output of <i>lsof's</i> <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> options to see if the <b>+m</b> and <b>+m</b><i> m</i> options are available.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>+|-M</b></dt>
<dd>
Enables (<b>+</b>) or disables (<b>-</b>) the reporting of portmapper registrations for local TCP, UDP and UDPLITE ports. The default reporting mode is set by the <i>lsof</i> builder with the HASPMAPENABLED #define in the dialect's machine.h header file; <i>lsof</i> is distributed with the HASPMAPENABLED #define deactivated, so portmapper reporting is disabled by default and must be requested with <b>+M</b>. Specifying <i>lsof's</i> <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option will report the default mode. Disabling portmapper registration when it is already disabled or enabling it when already enabled is acceptable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When portmapper registration reporting is enabled, <i>lsof</i> displays the portmapper registration (if any) for local TCP, UDP or UDPLITE ports in square brackets immediately following the port numbers or service names - e.g., ``:1234[name]'' or ``:name[100083]''. The registration information may be a name or number, depending on what the registering program supplied to the portmapper when it registered the port.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When portmapper registration reporting is enabled, <i>lsof</i> may run a little more slowly or even become blocked when access to the portmapper becomes congested or stopped. Reverse the reporting mode to determine if portmapper registration reporting is slowing or blocking <i>lsof</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
For purposes of portmapper registration reporting <i>lsof</i> considers a TCP, UDP or UDPLITE port local if: it is found in the local part of its containing kernel structure; or if it is located in the foreign part of its containing kernel structure and the local and foreign Internet addresses are the same; or if it is located in the foreign part of its containing kernel structure and the foreign Internet address is INADDR_LOOPBACK (127.0.0.1). This rule may make <i>lsof</i> ignore some foreign ports on machines with multiple interfaces when the foreign Internet address is on a different interface from the local one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
See the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for further discussion of portmapper registration reporting issues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-n</b></dt>
<dd>
This option inhibits the conversion of network numbers to host names for network files. Inhibiting conversion may make <i>lsof</i> run faster. It is also useful when host name lookup is not working properly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-N</b></dt>
<dd>
This option selects the listing of NFS files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-o</b></dt>
<dd>
This option directs <i>lsof</i> to display file offset at all times. It causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to be changed to OFFSET. Note: on some UNIX dialects <i>lsof</i> can't obtain accurate or consistent file offset information from its kernel data sources, sometimes just for particular kinds of files (e.g., socket files.) Consult the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The <b>-o</b> and <b>-s</b> options are mutually exclusive; they can't both be specified. When neither is specified, <i>lsof</i> displays whatever value - size or offset - is appropriate and available for the type of the file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-o</b><i> o</i></dt>
<dd>
This option defines the number of decimal digits (<i>o</i>) to be printed after the ``0t'' for a file offset before the form is switched to ``0x...''. An <i>o</i> value of zero (unlimited) directs <i>lsof</i> to use the ``0t'' form for all offset output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This option does NOT direct <i>lsof</i> to display offset at all times; specify <b>-o</b> (without a trailing number) to do that. This option only specifies the number of digits after ``0t'' in either mixed size and offset or offset-only output. Thus, for example, to direct <i>lsof</i> to display offset at all times with a decimal digit count of 10, use:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<br/>
	-o -o 10<br/>
or<br/>
	-oo10<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The default number of digits allowed after ``0t'' is normally 8, but may have been changed by the lsof builder. Consult the description of the <b>-o</b><i> o</i> option in the output of the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option to determine the default that is in effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-O</b></dt>
<dd>
This option directs <i>lsof</i> to bypass the strategy it uses to avoid being blocked by some kernel operations - i.e., doing them in forked child processes. See the <b>BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS</b> and <b>AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS</b> sections for more information on kernel operations that may block <i>lsof</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
While use of this option will reduce <i>lsof</i> startup overhead, it may also cause <i>lsof</i> to hang when the kernel doesn't respond to a function. Use this option cautiously.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-p</b><i> s</i></dt>
<dd>
This option excludes or selects the listing of files for the processes whose optional process IDentification (PID) numbers are in the comma-separated set <i>s</i> - e.g., ``123'' or ``123,^456''. (There should be no spaces in the set.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
PID numbers that begin with `^' (negation) represent exclusions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Multiple process ID numbers are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection. However, PID exclusions are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect before other selection criteria are applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-P</b></dt>
<dd>
This option inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files. Inhibiting the conversion may make <i>lsof</i> run a little faster. It is also useful when port name lookup is not working properly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>+|-r</b><i> [t[m&lt;fmt&gt;]]</i></dt>
<dd>
This option puts <i>lsof</i> in repeat mode. There <i>lsof</i> lists open files as selected by other options, delays <i>t</i> seconds (default fifteen), then repeats the listing, delaying and listing repetitively until stopped by a condition defined by the prefix to the option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If the prefix is a `-', repeat mode is endless. <i>Lsof</i> must be terminated with an interrupt or quit signal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If the prefix is `+', repeat mode will end the first cycle no open files are listed - and of course when <i>lsof</i> is stopped with an interrupt or quit signal. When repeat mode ends because no files are listed, the process exit code will be zero if any open files were ever listed; one, if none were ever listed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<i>Lsof</i> marks the end of each listing: if field output is in progress (the <b>-F</b>, option has been specified), the default marker is `m'; otherwise the default marker is ``========''. The marker is followed by a NL character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The optional &quot;m&lt;fmt&gt;&quot; argument specifies a format for the marker line. The &lt;fmt&gt; characters following `m' are interpreted as a format specification to the <i>strftime</i>(3) function, when both it and the <i>localtime</i>(3) function are available in the dialect's C library. Consult the <i>strftime</i>(3) documentation for what may appear in its format specification. Note that when field output is requested with the <b>-F</b> option, &lt;fmt&gt; cannot contain the NL format, ``%n''. Note also that when &lt;fmt&gt; contains spaces or other characters that affect the shell's interpretation of arguments, &lt;fmt&gt; must be quoted appropriately.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Repeat mode reduces <i>lsof</i> startup overhead, so it is more efficient to use this mode than to call <i>lsof</i> repetitively from a shell script, for example.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
To use repeat mode most efficiently, accompany <b>+|-r</b> with specification of other <i>lsof</i> selection options, so the amount of kernel memory access <i>lsof</i> does will be kept to a minimum. Options that filter at the process level - e.g., <b>-c</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-p</b>, <b>-u</b> - are the most efficient selectors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Repeat mode is useful when coupled with field output (see the <b>-F</b>, option description) and a supervising <i>awk</i> or <i>Perl</i> script, or a C program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-R</b></dt>
<dd>
This option directs lsof to list the Parent Process IDentification number in the PPID column.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-s</b><i> [p:s]</i></dt>
<dd>
<b>s</b> alone directs <i>lsof</i> to display file size at all times. It causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to be changed to SIZE. If the file does not have a size, nothing is displayed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When followed by a protocol name (<i>p</i>), either TCP or UDP, a colon (`:') and a comma-separated protocol state name list, the option causes open TCP and UDP files to be excluded if their state name(s) are in the list ( <i>s</i>) preceded by a `^'; or included if their name(s) are not preceded by a `^'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When an inclusion list is defined, only network files with state names in the list will be present in the <i>lsof</i> output. Thus, specifying one state name means that only network files with that lone state name wil be listed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Case is unimportant in the protocol or state names, but there may be no spaces and the colon (`:') separating the protocol name ( <i>p</i>) and the state name list (<i>s</i>) is required.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If only TCP and UDP files are to be listed, as controlled by the specified exclusions and inclusions, the <b>-i</b> option must be specified, too. If only a single protocol's files are to be listed, add its name as an argument to the <b>-i</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
For example, to list only network files with TCP state LISTEN, use:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<br/>
	-iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Or, for example, to list network files with all UDP states except Idle, use:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<br/>
	-iUDP -sUDP:Idle<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
State names vary with UNIX dialects, so it's not possible to provide a complete list.  Some common TCP state names are: CLOSED, IDLE, BOUND, LISTEN, ESTABLISHED, SYN_SENT, SYN_RCDV, ESTABLISHED, CLOSE_WAIT, FIN_WAIT1, CLOSING, LAST_ACK, FIN_WAIT_2, and TIME_WAIT. Two common UDP state names are Unbound and Idle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
See the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information on how to use protocol state exclusion and inclusion, including examples.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The <b>-o</b> (without a following decimal digit count) and <b>-s</b> option (without a following protocol and state name list) are mutually exclusive; they can't both be specified. When neither is specified, <i>lsof</i> displays whatever value - size or offset - is appropriate and available for the type of file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Since some types of files don't have true sizes - sockets, FIFOs, pipes, etc. - lsof displays for their sizes the content amounts in their associated kernel buffers, if possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-S</b><i> [t]</i></dt>
<dd>
This option specifies an optional time-out seconds value for kernel functions - <i>lstat</i>(2), <i>readlink</i>(2), and <i>stat</i>(2) - that might otherwise deadlock. The minimum for <i>t</i> is two; the default, fifteen; when no value is specified, the default is used.</dd>
</dl>

<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
See the <b>BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS</b> section for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-T</b><i> [t]</i></dt>
<dd>
This option controls the reporting of some TCP/TPI information, also reported by <i>netstat</i>(1), following the network addresses. In normal output the information appears in parentheses, each item except TCP or TPI state name identified by a keyword, followed by `=', separated from others by a single space:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

Not all values are reported for all UNIX dialects. Items values (when available) are reported after the item name and '='.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When the field output mode is in effect (See <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b>.) each item appears as a field with a `T' leading character.</dd>

</dt>
<dd>
<b>-T</b> with no following key characters disables TCP/TPI information reporting.</dd>
</dl>

Not all selections are enabled for some UNIX dialects. State may be selected for all dialects and is reported by default. The <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> help output for the <b>-T</b> option will show what selections may be used with the UNIX dialect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When <b>-T</b> is used to select information - i.e., it is followed by one or more selection characters - the displaying of state is disabled by default, and it must be explicitly selected again in the characters following <b>-T</b>. (In effect, then, the default is equivalent to <b>-Ts</b>.) For example, if queue lengths and state are desired, use <b>-Tqs</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>
Socket options, socket states, some socket values, TCP flags and one TCP value may be reported (when available in the UNIX dialect) in the form of the names that commonly appear after SO_, so_, SS_, TCP_  and TF_ in the dialect's header files - most often &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;, &lt;sys/socketvar.h&gt; and &lt;netinet/tcp_var.h&gt;.

If a login name or user ID is preceded by a `^', it becomes a negation - i.e., files of processes owned by the login name or user ID will never be listed. A negated login name or user ID selection is neither ANDed nor ORed with other selections; it is applied before all other selections and absolutely excludes the listing of the files of the process. For example, to direct <i>lsof</i> to exclude the listing of files belonging to root processes, specify ``-u^root'' or ``-u^0''.</dd>

This option selects the listing of <i>lsof</i> version information, including: revision number; when the <i>lsof</i> binary was constructed; who constructed the binary and where; the name of the compiler used to construct the <i>lsof binary;</i> the version number of the compiler when readily available; the compiler and loader flags used to construct the <i>lsof</i> binary; and system information, typically the output of <i>uname</i>'s <b>-a</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-V</b></dt>

This option directs <i>lsof</i> to indicate the items it was asked to list and failed to find - command names, file names, Internet addresses or files, login names, NFS files, PIDs, PGIDs, and UIDs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When other options are ANDed to search options, or compile-time options restrict the listing of some files, <i>lsof</i> may not report that it failed to find a search item when an ANDed option or compile-time option prevents the listing of the open file containing the located search item.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

<dd>
For example, ``lsof -V -iTCP@foobar -a -d 999'' may not report a failure to locate open files at ``TCP@foobar'' and may not list any, if none have a file descriptor number of 999. A similar situation arises when HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY are defined at compile time and they prevent the listing of open files.</dd>

<b>WARNING:</b> because this option uses the kernel readx() function, its use on a busy AIX system might cause an application process to hang so completely that it can neither be killed nor stopped. I have never seen this happen or had a report of its happening, but I think there is a remote possibility it could happen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

By default use of readx() is disabled. On AIX 5L and above <i>lsof</i> may need setuid-root permission to perform the actions this option requests.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The <i>lsof</i> builder may specify that the <b>-X</b> option be restricted to processes whose real UID is root. If that has been done, the <b>-X</b> option will not appear in the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> help output unless the real UID of the <i>lsof</i> process is root. The default <i>lsof</i> distribution allows any UID to specify <b>-X,</b> so by default it will appear in the help output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
When AIX readx() use is disabled, <i>lsof</i> may not be able to report information for all text and loader file references, but it may also avoid exacerbating an AIX kernel directory search kernel error, known as the Stale Segment ID bug.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The readx() function, used by <i>lsof</i> or any other program to access some sections of kernel virtual memory, can trigger the Stale Segment ID bug. It can cause the kernel's dir_search() function to believe erroneously that part of an in-memory copy of a file system directory has been zeroed. Another application process, distinct from <i>lsof</i>, asking the kernel to search the directory - e.g., by using <i>open</i>(2) - can cause dir_search() to loop forever, thus hanging the application process.</dd>

<dd>
If a <i>name</i> is the mounted-on directory of a file system or the device of the file system, <i>lsof</i> will list all the files open on the file system. To be considered a file system, the <i>name</i> must match a mounted-on directory name in <i>mount</i>(8) output, or match the name of a block device associated with a mounted-on directory name. The <b>+|-f</b> option may be used to force <i>lsof</i> to consider a <i>name</i> a file system identifier ( <b>+f</b>) or a simple file (<b>-f</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If <i>name</i> is a path to a directory that is not the mounted-on directory name of a file system, it is treated just as a regular file is treated - i.e., its listing is restricted to processes that have it open as a file or as a process-specific directory, such as the root or current working directory.

If a <i>name</i> is a UNIX domain socket name, <i>lsof</i> will usually search for it by the characters of the name alone - exactly as it is specified and is recorded in the kernel socket structure. (See the next paragraph for an exception to that rule for Linux.) Specifying a relative path - e.g., <i>./file</i> - in place of the file's absolute path - e.g., <i>/tmp/file</i> - won't work because <i>lsof</i> must match the characters you specify with what it finds in the kernel UNIX domain socket structures.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If a <i>name</i> is a Linux UNIX domain socket name, in one case <i>lsof</i> is able to search for it by its device and inode number, allowing <i>name</i> to be a relative path. The case requires that the absolute path -- i.e., one beginning with a slash ('/') be used by the process that created the socket, and hence be stored in the <i>/proc/net/unix</i> file; and it requires that <i>lsof</i> be able to obtain the device and node numbers of both the absolute path in <i>/proc/net/unix</i> and <i>name</i> via successful <i>stat</i>(2) system calls. When those conditions are met, <i>lsof</i> will be able to search for the UNIX domain socket when some path to it is is specified in <i>name</i>. Thus, for example, if the path is <i>/dev/log</i>, and an <i>lsof</i> search is initiated when the working directory is <i>/dev</i>, then <i>name</i> could be <i>./log</i>.</dd>

<h1>AFS</h1> <i>Lsof</i> supports the recognition of AFS files for these dialects (and AFS versions):<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
	AIX 4.1.4 (AFS 3.4a)<br/>
	HP-UX 9.0.5 (AFS 3.4a)<br/>
	Linux 1.2.13 (AFS 3.3)<br/>
	Solaris 2.[56] (AFS 3.4a)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
It may recognize AFS files on other versions of these dialects, but has not been tested there. Depending on how AFS is implemented, <i>lsof</i> may recognize AFS files in other dialects, or may have difficulties recognizing AFS files in the supported dialects.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> may have trouble identifying all aspects of AFS files in supported dialects when AFS kernel support is implemented via dynamic modules whose addresses do not appear in the kernel's variable name list. In that case, <i>lsof</i> may have to guess at the identity of AFS files, and might not be able to obtain volume information from the kernel that is needed for calculating AFS volume node numbers. When <i>lsof</i> can't compute volume node numbers, it reports blank in the NODE column.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-A</b><i> A</i> option is available in some dialect implementations of <i>lsof</i> for specifying the name list file where dynamic module kernel addresses may be found. When this option is available, it will be listed in the <i>lsof</i> help output, presented in response to the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
See the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information about dynamic modules, their symbols, and how they affect <i>lsof</i> options.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Because AFS path lookups don't seem to participate in the kernel's name cache operations, <i>lsof</i> can't identify path name components for AFS files.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SECURITY</h1> <i>Lsof</i> has three features that may cause security concerns. First, its default compilation mode allows anyone to list all open files with it. Second, by default it creates a user-readable and user-writable device cache file in the home directory of the real user ID that executes <i>lsof</i>. (The list-all-open-files and device cache features may be disabled when <i>lsof</i> is compiled.) Third, its <b>-k</b> and <b>-m</b> options name alternate kernel name list or memory files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Restricting the listing of all open files is controlled by the compile-time HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY options. When HASSECURITY is defined, <i>lsof</i> will allow only the root user to list all open files. The non-root user may list only open files of processes with the same user IDentification number as the real user ID number of the <i>lsof</i> process (the one that its user logged on with).<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, if HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY are both defined, anyone may list open socket files, provided they are selected with the <b>-i</b> option.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When HASSECURITY is not defined, anyone may list all open files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Help output, presented in response to the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option, gives the status of the HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY definitions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the <b>Security</b> section of the <i>00README</i> file of the <i>lsof</i> distribution for information on building <i>lsof</i> with the HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY options enabled.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Creation and use of a user-readable and user-writable device cache file is controlled by the compile-time HASDCACHE option. See the <b>DEVICE CACHE FILE</b> section and the sections that follow it for details on how its path is formed. For security considerations it is important to note that in the default <i>lsof</i> distribution, if the real user ID under which <i>lsof</i> is executed is root, the device cache file will be written in root's home directory - e.g., <i>/</i> or <i>/root</i>. When HASDCACHE is not defined, <i>lsof</i> does not write or attempt to read a device cache file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When HASDCACHE is defined, the <i>lsof</i> help output, presented in response to the <b>-h</b>, <b>-D?</b>, or <b>-?</b> options, will provide device cache file handling information. When HASDCACHE is not defined, the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> output will have no <b>-D</b> option description.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Before you decide to disable the device cache file feature - enabling it improves the performance of <i>lsof</i> by reducing the startup overhead of examining all the nodes in <i>/dev</i> (or <i>/devices</i>) - read the discussion of it in the <i>00DCACHE</i> file of the <i>lsof</i> distribution and the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
WHEN IN DOUBT, YOU CAN TEMPORARILY DISABLE THE USE OF THE DEVICE CACHE FILE WITH THE <b>-Di</b> OPTION.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <i>lsof</i> user declares alternate kernel name list or memory files with the <b>-k</b> and <b>-m</b> options, <i>lsof</i> checks the user's authority to read them with <i>access</i>(2). This is intended to prevent whatever special power <i>lsof's</i> modes might confer on it from letting it read files not normally accessible via the authority of the real user ID.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OUTPUT</h1> This section describes the information <i>lsof</i> lists for each open file. See the <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b> section for additional information on output that can be processed by another program.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> only outputs printable (declared so by <i>isprint</i>(3)) 8 bit characters. Non-printable characters are printed in one of three forms: the C ``\[bfrnt]'' form; the control character `^' form (e.g., ``^@''); or hexadecimal leading ``\x'' form (e.g., ``\xab''). Space is non-printable in the COMMAND column (``\x20'') and printable elsewhere.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For some dialects - if HASSETLOCALE is defined in the dialect's machine.h header file - <i>lsof</i> will print the extended 8 bit characters of a language locale. The <i>lsof</i> process must be supplied a language locale environment variable (e.g., LANG) whose value represents a known language locale in which the extended characters are considered printable by <i>isprint</i>(3). Otherwise <i>lsof</i> considers the extended characters non-printable and prints them according to its rules for non-printable characters, stated above. Consult your dialect's <i>setlocale</i>(3) man page for the names of other environment variables that may be used in place of LANG - e.g., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, etc.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof's</i> language locale support for a dialect also covers wide characters - e.g., UTF-8 - when HASSETLOCALE and HASWIDECHAR are defined in the dialect's machine.h header file, and when a suitable language locale has been defined in the appropriate environment variable for the <i>lsof</i> process. Wide characters are printable under those conditions if <i>iswprint</i>(3) reports them to be. If HASSETLOCALE, HASWIDECHAR and a suitable language locale aren't defined, or if <i>iswprint</i>(3) reports wide characters that aren't printable, <i>lsof</i> considers the wide characters non-printable and prints each of their 8 bits according to its rules for non-printable characters, stated above.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Consult the answers to the &quot;Language locale support&quot; questions in the lsof FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information.<div class="spacer">

<i>Lsof</i> dynamically sizes the output columns each time it runs, guaranteeing that each column is a minimum size. It also guarantees that each column is separated from its predecessor by at least one space.<dl>
<dt>
COMMAND</dt>
<dd>
contains the first nine characters of the name of the UNIX command associated with the process.

or a kernel reference address that identifies the file (The kernel reference address may be used for FIFO's, for example.);</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
or the base address or device name of a Linux AX.25 socket device.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Usually only the lower thirty two bits of Tru64 UNIX kernel addresses are displayed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
SIZE, SIZE/OFF, or OFFSET</dt>
<dd>
is the size of the file or the file offset in bytes. A value is displayed in this column only if it is available. <i>Lsof</i> displays whatever value - size or offset - is appropriate for the type of the file and the version of <i>lsof</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
On some UNIX dialects <i>lsof</i> can't obtain accurate or consistent file offset information from its kernel data sources, sometimes just for particular kinds of files (e.g., socket files.) In other cases, files don't have true sizes - e.g., sockets, FIFOs, pipes - so <i>lsof</i> displays for their sizes the content amounts it finds in their kernel buffer descriptors (e.g., socket buffer size counts or TCP/IP window sizes.) Consult the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The file size is displayed in decimal; the offset is normally displayed in decimal with a leading ``0t'' if it contains 8 digits or less; in hexadecimal with a leading ``0x'' if it is longer than 8 digits. (Consult the <b>-o</b><i> o</i> option description for information on when 8 might default to some other value.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Thus the leading ``0t'' and ``0x'' identify an offset when the column may contain both a size and an offset (i.e., its title is SIZE/OFF).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If the <b>-o</b> option is specified, <i>lsof</i> always displays the file offset (or nothing if no offset is available) and labels the column OFFSET. The offset always begins with ``0t'' or ``0x'' as described above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The <i>lsof</i> user can control the switch from ``0t'' to ``0x'' with the <b>-o</b><i> o</i> option. Consult its description for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If the <b>-s</b> option is specified, <i>lsof</i> always displays the file size (or nothing if no size is available) and labels the column SIZE. The <b>-o</b> and <b>-s</b> options are mutually exclusive; they can't both be specified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
For files that don't have a fixed size - e.g., don't reside on a disk device - <i>lsof</i> will display appropriate information about the current size or position of the file if it is available in the kernel structures that define the file.</dd>
</dl>

</dt>
<dd>
or the name of a character special or block special device;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
or the local and remote Internet addresses of a network file; the local host name or IP number is followed by a colon (':'), the port, ``-&gt;'', and the two-part remote address; IP addresses may be reported as numbers or names, depending on the <b>+|-M</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-P</b> options; colon-separated IPv6 numbers are enclosed in square brackets; IPv4 INADDR_ANY and IPv6 IN6_IS_ADDR_UNSPECIFIED addresses, and zero port numbers are represented by an asterisk ('*'); a UDP destination address may be followed by the amount of time elapsed since the last packet was sent to the destination; TCP, UDP and UDPLITE remote addresses may be followed by TCP/TPI information in parentheses - state (e.g., ``(ESTABLISHED)'', ``(Unbound)''), queue sizes, and window sizes (not all dialects) - in a fashion similar to what <i>netstat</i>(1) reports; see the <b>-T</b> option description or the description of the TCP/TPI field in <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b> for more information on state, queue size, and window size;</dd>

For dialects that support a ``namefs'' file system, allowing one file to be attached to another with <i>fattach</i>(3C), <i>lsof</i> will add ``(FA:&lt;address1&gt;&lt;direction&gt;&lt;address2&gt;)'' to the NAME column. &lt;address1&gt; and &lt;address2&gt; are hexadecimal vnode addresses. &lt;direction&gt; will be ``&lt;-'' if &lt;address2&gt; has been fattach'ed to this vnode whose address is &lt;address1&gt;; and ``-&gt;'' if &lt;address1&gt;, the vnode address of this vnode, has been fattach'ed to &lt;address2&gt;. &lt;address1&gt; may be omitted if it already appears in the DEVICE column.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> may add two parenthetical notes to the NAME column for open Solaris 10 files: ``(?)'' if <i>lsof</i> considers the path name of questionable accuracy; and ``(deleted)'' if the <b>-X</b> option has been specified and <i>lsof</i> detects the open file's path name has been deleted. Consult the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information on these NAME column additions.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>LOCKS</h1> <i>Lsof</i> can't adequately report the wide variety of UNIX dialect file locks in a single character. What it reports in a single character is a compromise between the information it finds in the kernel and the limitations of the reporting format.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Moreover, when a process holds several byte level locks on a file, <i>lsof</i> only reports the status of the first lock it encounters. If it is a byte level lock, then the lock character will be reported in lower case - i.e., `r', `w', or `x' - rather than the upper case equivalent reported for a full file lock.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Generally <i>lsof</i> can only report on locks held by local processes on local files. When a local process sets a lock on a remotely mounted (e.g., NFS) file, the remote server host usually records the lock state. One exception is Solaris - at some patch levels of 2.3, and in all versions above 2.4, the Solaris kernel records information on remote locks in local structures.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> has trouble reporting locks for some UNIX dialects. Consult the <b>BUGS</b> section of this manual page or the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</h1> When the <b>-F</b> option is specified, <i>lsof</i> produces output that is suitable for processing by another program - e.g, an <i>awk</i> or <i>Perl</i> script, or a C program.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each unit of information is output in a field that is identified with a leading character and terminated by a NL (012) (or a NUL (000) if the 0 (zero) field identifier character is specified.) The data of the field follows immediately after the field identification character and extends to the field terminator.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is possible to think of field output as process and file sets. A process set begins with a field whose identifier is `p' (for process IDentifier (PID)). It extends to the beginning of the next PID field or the beginning of the first file set of the process, whichever comes first. Included in the process set are fields that identify the command, the process group IDentification (PGID) number, and the user ID (UID) number or login name.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A file set begins with a field whose identifier is `f' (for file descriptor). It is followed by lines that describe the file's access mode, lock state, type, device, size, offset, inode, protocol, name and stream module names. It extends to the beginning of the next file or process set, whichever comes first.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the NUL (000) field terminator has been selected with the 0 (zero) field identifier character, <i>lsof</i> ends each process and file set with a NL (012) character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> always produces one field, the PID (`p') field. All other fields may be declared optionally in the field identifier character list that follows the <b>-F</b> option. When a field selection character identifies an item <i>lsof</i> does not normally list - e.g., PPID, selected with <b>-R</b> - specification of the field character - e.g., `` <b>-FR</b>'' - also selects the listing of the item.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is entirely possible to select a set of fields that cannot easily be parsed - e.g., if the field descriptor field is not selected, it may be difficult to identify file sets. To help you avoid this difficulty, <i>lsof</i> supports the <b>-F</b> option; it selects the output of all fields with NL terminators (the <b>-F0</b> option pair selects the output of all fields with NUL terminators). For compatibility reasons neither <b>-F</b> nor <b>-F0</b> select the raw device field.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These are the fields that <i>lsof</i> will produce. The single character listed first is the field identifier.<div class="spacer">
</div>

		    WW=&lt;window write size&gt;  (not all dialects)<br/>
		(TCP/TPI information isn't reported for all supported<br/>
		  UNIX dialects. The <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> help output for the<br/>
		  <b>-T</b> option will show what TCP/TPI reporting can be<br/>
		  requested.)<br/>

<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can get on-line help information on these characters and their descriptions by specifying the <b>-F?</b> option pair. (Escape the `?' character as your shell requires.) Additional information on field content can be found in the <b>OUTPUT</b> section.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As an example, ``<b>-F pcfn</b>'' will select the process ID (`p'), command name (`c'), file descriptor (`f') and file name (`n') fields with an NL field terminator character; `` <b>-F pcfn0</b>'' selects the same output with a NUL (000) field terminator character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> doesn't produce all fields for every process or file set, only those that are available. Some fields are mutually exclusive: file device characters and file major/minor device numbers; file inode number and protocol name; file name and stream identification; file size and offset. One or the other member of these mutually exclusive sets will appear in field output, but not both.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Normally <i>lsof</i> ends each field with a NL (012) character. The 0 (zero) field identifier character may be specified to change the field terminator character to a NUL (000). A NUL terminator may be easier to process with <i>xargs (1),</i> for example, or with programs whose quoting mechanisms may not easily cope with the range of characters in the field output. When the NUL field terminator is in use, <i>lsof</i> ends each process and file set with a NL (012).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Three aids to producing programs that can process <i>lsof</i> field output are included in the <i>lsof</i> distribution. The first is a C header file, <i>lsof_fields.h</i>, that contains symbols for the field identification characters, indexes for storing them in a table, and explanation strings that may be compiled into programs. <i>Lsof</i> uses this header file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The second aid is a set of sample scripts that process field output, written in <i>awk</i>, <i>Perl</i> 4, and <i>Perl</i> 5. They're located in the <i>scripts</i> subdirectory of the <i>lsof</i> distribution.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The third aid is the C library used for the <i>lsof</i> test suite. The test suite is written in C and uses field output to validate the correct operation of <i>lsof</i>. The library can be found in the <i>tests/LTlib.c</i> file of the <i>lsof</i> distribution. The library uses the first aid, the <i>lsof_fields.h</i> header file.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS</h1> <i>Lsof</i> can be blocked by some kernel functions that it uses - <i>lstat</i>(2), <i>readlink</i>(2), and <i>stat</i>(2). These functions are stalled in the kernel, for example, when the hosts where mounted NFS file systems reside become inaccessible.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> attempts to break these blocks with timers and child processes, but the techniques are not wholly reliable. When <i>lsof</i> does manage to break a block, it will report the break with an error message. The messages may be suppressed with the <b>-t</b> and <b>-w</b> options.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The default timeout value may be displayed with the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option, and it may be changed with the <b>-S</b><i> [t]</i> option. The minimum for <i>t</i> is two seconds, but you should avoid small values, since slow system responsiveness can cause short timeouts to expire unexpectedly and perhaps stop <i>lsof</i> before it can produce any output.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <i>lsof</i> has to break a block during its access of mounted file system information, it normally continues, although with less information available to display about open files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> can also be directed to avoid the protection of timers and child processes when using the kernel functions that might block by specifying the <b>-O</b> option. While this will allow <i>lsof</i> to start up with less overhead, it exposes <i>lsof</i> completely to the kernel situations that might block it. Use this option cautiously.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS</h1> You can use the <b>-b</b> option to tell <i>lsof</i> to avoid using kernel functions that would block. Some cautions apply.<div class="spacer">
</div>
First, using this option usually requires that your system supply alternate device numbers in place of the device numbers that <i>lsof</i> would normally obtain with the <i>lstat</i>(2) and <i>stat</i>(2) kernel functions. See the <b>ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS</b> section for more information on alternate device numbers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Second, you can't specify <i>names</i> for <i>lsof</i> to locate unless they're file system names. This is because <i>lsof</i> needs to know the device and inode numbers of files listed with <i>names</i> in the <i>lsof</i> options, and the <b>-b</b> option prevents <i>lsof</i> from obtaining them. Moreover, since <i>lsof</i> only has device numbers for the file systems that have alternates, its ability to locate files on file systems depends completely on the availability and accuracy of the alternates. If no alternates are available, or if they're incorrect, <i>lsof</i> won't be able to locate files on the named file systems.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Third, if the names of your file system directories that <i>lsof</i> obtains from your system's mount table are symbolic links, <i>lsof</i> won't be able to resolve the links. This is because the <b>-b</b> option causes <i>lsof</i> to avoid the kernel <i>readlink</i>(2) function it uses to resolve symbolic links.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Finally, using the <b>-b</b> option causes <i>lsof</i> to issue warning messages when it needs to use the kernel functions that the <b>-b</b> option directs it to avoid. You can suppress these messages by specifying the <b>-w</b> option, but if you do, you won't see the alternate device numbers reported in the warning messages.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS</h1> On some dialects, when <i>lsof</i> has to break a block because it can't get information about a mounted file system via the <i>lstat</i>(2) and <i>stat</i>(2) kernel functions, or because you specified the <b>-b</b> option, <i>lsof</i> can obtain some of the information it needs - the device number and possibly the file system type - from the system mount table. When that is possible, <i>lsof</i> will report the device number it obtained. (You can suppress the report by specifying the <b>-w</b> option.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can assist this process if your mount table is supported with an <i>/etc/mtab</i> or <i>/etc/mnttab</i> file that contains an options field by adding a ``dev=xxxx'' field for mount points that do not have one in their options strings. Note: you must be able to edit the file - i.e., some mount tables like recent Solaris /etc/mnttab or Linux /proc/mounts are read-only and can't be modified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may also be able to supply device numbers using the <b>+m</b> and <b>+m</b><i> m</i> options, provided they are supported by your dialect. Check the output of <i>lsof's</i> <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> options to see if the <b>+m</b> and <b>+m</b><i> m</i> options are available.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The ``xxxx'' portion of the field is the hexadecimal value of the file system's device number. (Consult the <i>st_dev</i> field of the output of the <i>lstat</i>(2) and <i>stat</i>(2) functions for the appropriate values for your file systems.) Here's an example from a Sun Solaris 2.6 <i>/etc/mnttab</i> for a file system remotely mounted via NFS:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
	nfs  ignore,noquota,dev=2a40001<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There's an advantage to having ``dev=xxxx'' entries in your mount table file, especially for file systems that are mounted from remote NFS servers. When a remote server crashes and you want to identify its users by running <i>lsof</i> on one of its clients, <i>lsof</i> probably won't be able to get output from the <i>lstat</i>(2) and <i>stat</i>(2) functions for the file system. If it can obtain the file system's device number from the mount table, it will be able to display the files open on the crashed NFS server.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some dialects that do not use an ASCII <i>/etc/mtab</i> or <i>/etc/mnttab</i> file for the mount table may still provide an alternative device number in their internal mount tables. This includes AIX, Apple Darwin, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Tru64 UNIX. <i>Lsof</i> knows how to obtain the alternative device number for these dialects and uses it when its attempt to <i>lstat</i>(2) or <i>stat</i>(2) the file system is blocked.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you're not sure your dialect supplies alternate device numbers for file systems from its mount table, use this <i>lsof</i> incantation to see if it reports any alternate device numbers:<dl>
<dt>
</dt>
<dd>
lsof -b</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Look for standard error file warning messages that begin ``assuming &quot;dev=xxxx&quot; from ...''.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>KERNEL NAME CACHE</h1> <i>Lsof</i> is able to examine the kernel's name cache or use other kernel facilities (e.g., the ADVFS 4.x tag_to_path() function under Tru64 UNIX) on some dialects for most file system types, excluding AFS, and extract recently used path name components from it. (AFS file system path lookups don't use the kernel's name cache; some Solaris VxFS file system operations apparently don't use it, either.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> reports the complete paths it finds in the NAME column. If <i>lsof</i> can't report all components in a path, it reports in the NAME column the file system name, followed by a space, two `-' characters, another space, and the name components it has located, separated by the `/' character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <i>lsof</i> is run in repeat mode - i.e., with the <b>-r</b> option specified - the extent to which it can report path name components for the same file may vary from cycle to cycle. That's because other running processes can cause the kernel to remove entries from its name cache and replace them with others.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof's</i> use of the kernel name cache to identify the paths of files can lead it to report incorrect components under some circumstances. This can happen when the kernel name cache uses device and node number as a key (e.g., SCO OpenServer) and a key on a rapidly changing file system is reused. If the UNIX dialect's kernel doesn't purge the name cache entry for a file when it is unlinked, <i>lsof</i> may find a reference to the wrong entry in the cache. The <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) has more information on this situation.<div class="spacer">

<div class="section">
<h1>DEVICE CACHE FILE</h1> Examining all members of the <i>/dev</i> (or <i>/devices</i>) node tree with <i>stat</i>(2) functions can be time consuming. What's more, the information that <i>lsof</i> needs - device number, inode number, and path - rarely changes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Consequently, <i>lsof</i> normally maintains an ASCII text file of cached <i>/dev</i> (or <i>/devices</i>) information (exception: the /proc-based Linux <i>lsof</i> where it's not needed.) The local system administrator who builds <i>lsof</i> can control the way the device cache file path is formed, selecting from these options:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
	Path from the <b>-D</b> option;<br/>
	Path from an environment variable;<br/>
	System-wide path;<br/>
	Personal path (the default);<br/>
	Personal path, modified by an environment variable.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Consult the output of the <b>-h</b>, <b>-D? ,</b> or <b>-?</b> help options for the current state of device cache support. The help output lists the default read-mode device cache file path that is in effect for the current invocation of <i>lsof</i>. The <b>-D?</b> option output lists the read-only and write device cache file paths, the names of any applicable environment variables, and the personal device cache path format.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> can detect that the current device cache file has been accidentally or maliciously modified by integrity checks, including the computation and verification of a sixteen bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) sum on the file's contents. When <i>lsof</i> senses something wrong with the file, it issues a warning and attempts to remove the current cache file and create a new copy, but only to a path that the process can legitimately write.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The path from which a <i>lsof</i> process may attempt to read a device cache file may not be the same as the path to which it can legitimately write. Thus when <i>lsof</i> senses that it needs to update the device cache file, it may choose a different path for writing it from the path from which it read an incorrect or outdated version.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If available, the <b>-Dr</b> option will inhibit the writing of a new device cache file. (It's always available when specified without a path name argument.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a new device is added to the system, the device cache file may need to be recreated. Since <i>lsof</i> compares the mtime of the device cache file with the mtime and ctime of the <i>/dev</i> (or <i>/devices</i>) directory, it usually detects that a new device has been added; in that case <i>lsof</i> issues a warning message and attempts to rebuild the device cache file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Whenever <i>lsof</i> writes a device cache file, it sets its ownership to the real UID of the executing process, and its permission modes to 0600, this restricting its reading and writing to the file's owner.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>LSOF PERMISSIONS THAT AFFECT DEVICE CACHE FILE ACCESS</h1> Two permissions of the <i>lsof</i> executable affect its ability to access device cache files. The permissions are set by the local system administrator when <i>lsof</i> is installed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first and rarer permission is setuid-root. It comes into effect when <i>lsof</i> is executed; its effective UID is then root, while its real (i.e., that of the logged-on user) UID is not. The <i>lsof</i> distribution recommends that versions for these dialects run setuid-root.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
	HP-UX 11.11 and 11.23<br/>
	Linux<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The second and more common permission is setgid. It comes into effect when the effective group IDentification number (GID) of the <i>lsof</i> process is set to one that can access kernel memory devices - e.g., ``kmem'', ``sys'', or ``system''.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An <i>lsof</i> process that has setgid permission usually surrenders the permission after it has accessed the kernel memory devices. When it does that, <i>lsof</i> can allow more liberal device cache path formations. The <i>lsof</i> distribution recommends that versions for these dialects run setgid and be allowed to surrender setgid permission.<div class="spacer">

<div class="section">
<h1>DEVICE CACHE FILE PATH FROM THE -D OPTION</h1> The <b>-D</b> option provides limited means for specifying the device cache file path. Its <b>?</b> function will report the read-only and write device cache file paths that <i>lsof</i> will use.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the <b>-D</b> <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions are available, you can use them to request that the cache file be built in a specific location ( <b>b</b>[<i>path</i>]); read but not rebuilt ( <b>r</b>[<i>path</i>]); or read and rebuilt ( <b>u</b>[<i>path</i>]). The <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions are restricted under some conditions. They are restricted when the <i>lsof</i> process is setuid-root. The path specified with the <b>r</b> function is always read-only, even when it is available.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions are also restricted when the <i>lsof</i> process runs setgid and <i>lsof</i> doesn't surrender the setgid permission. (See the <b>LSOF PERMISSIONS THAT AFFECT DEVICE CACHE FILE ACCESS</b> section for a list of implementations that normally don't surrender their setgid permission.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
A further <b>-D</b> function, <b>i</b> (for ignore), is always available.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When available, the <b>b</b> function tells <i>lsof</i> to read device information from the kernel with the <i>stat</i>(2) function and build a device cache file at the indicated path.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When available, the <b>r</b> function tells <i>lsof</i> to read the device cache file, but not update it. When a path argument accompanies <b>-Dr</b>, it names the device cache file path. The <b>r</b> function is always available when it is specified without a path name argument. If <i>lsof</i> is not running setuid-root and surrenders its setgid permission, a path name argument may accompany the <b>r</b> function.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When available, the <b>u</b> function tells <i>lsof</i> to attempt to read and use the device cache file. If it can't read the file, or if it finds the contents of the file incorrect or outdated, it will read information from the kernel, and attempt to write an updated version of the device cache file, but only to a path it considers legitimate for the <i>lsof</i> process effective and real UIDs.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DEVICE CACHE PATH FROM AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE</h1> <i>Lsof's</i> second choice for the device cache file is the contents of the LSOFDEVCACHE environment variable. It avoids this choice if the <i>lsof</i> process is setuid-root, or the real UID of the process is root.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A further restriction applies to a device cache file path taken from the LSOFDEVCACHE environment variable: <i>lsof</i> will not write a device cache file to the path if the <i>lsof</i> process doesn't surrender its setgid permission. (See the <b>LSOF PERMISSIONS THAT AFFECT DEVICE CACHE FILE ACCESS</b> section for information on implementations that don't surrender their setgid permission.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The local system administrator can disable the use of the LSOFDEVCACHE environment variable or change its name when building <i>lsof</i>. Consult the output of <b>-D?</b> for the environment variable's name.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYSTEM-WIDE DEVICE CACHE PATH</h1> The local system administrator may choose to have a system-wide device cache file when building <i>lsof</i>. That file will generally be constructed by a special system administration procedure when the system is booted or when the contents of <i>/dev</i> or <i>/devices</i>) changes. If defined, it is <i>lsof's</i> third device cache file path choice.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can tell that a system-wide device cache file is in effect for your local installation by examining the <i>lsof</i> help option output - i.e., the output from the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> will never write to the system-wide device cache file path by default. It must be explicitly named with a <b>-D</b> function in a root-owned procedure. Once the file has been written, the procedure must change its permission modes to 0644 (owner-read and owner-write, group-read, and other-read).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>PERSONAL DEVICE CACHE PATH (DEFAULT)</h1> The default device cache file path of the <i>lsof</i> distribution is one recorded in the home directory of the real UID that executes <i>lsof</i>. Added to the home directory is a second path component of the form <i>.lsof_hostname</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is <i>lsof's</i> fourth device cache file path choice, and is usually the default. If a system-wide device cache file path was defined when <i>lsof</i> was built, this fourth choice will be applied when <i>lsof</i> can't find the system-wide device cache file. This is the <b>only</b> time <i>lsof</i> uses two paths when reading the device cache file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>hostname</i> part of the second component is the base name of the executing host, as returned by <i>gethostname</i>(2). The base name is defined to be the characters preceding the first `.' in the <i>gethostname</i>(2) output, or all the <i>gethostname</i>(2) output if it contains no `.'.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The device cache file belongs to the user ID and is readable and writable by the user ID alone - i.e., its modes are 0600. Each distinct real user ID on a given host that executes <i>lsof</i> has a distinct device cache file. The <i>hostname</i> part of the path distinguishes device cache files in an NFS-mounted home directory into which device cache files are written from several different hosts.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The personal device cache file path formed by this method represents a device cache file that <i>lsof</i> will attempt to read, and will attempt to write should it not exist or should its contents be incorrect or outdated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-Dr</b> option without a path name argument will inhibit the writing of a new device cache file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-D?</b> option will list the format specification for constructing the personal device cache file. The conversions used in the format specification are described in the <i>00DCACHE</i> file of the <i>lsof</i> distribution.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>MODIFIED PERSONAL DEVICE CACHE PATH</h1> If this option is defined by the local system administrator when <i>lsof</i> is built, the LSOFPERSDCPATH environment variable contents may be used to add a component of the personal device cache file path.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The LSOFPERSDCPATH variable contents are inserted in the path at the place marked by the local system administrator with the ``%p'' conversion in the HASPERSDC format specification of the dialect's <i>machine.h</i> header file. (It's placed right after the home directory in the default <i>lsof</i> distribution.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Thus, for example, if LSOFPERSDCPATH contains ``LSOF'', the home directory is ``/Homes/abe'', the host name is ``lsof.itap.purdue.edu'', and the HASPERSDC format is the default (``%h/%p.lsof_%L''), the modified personal device cache file path is:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
	/Homes/abe/LSOF/.lsof_vic<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The LSOFPERSDCPATH environment variable is ignored when the <i>lsof</i> process is setuid-root or when the real UID of the process is root.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> will not write to a modified personal device cache file path if the <i>lsof</i> process doesn't surrender setgid permission. (See the <b>LSOF PERMISSIONS THAT AFFECT DEVICE CACHE FILE ACCESS</b> section for a list of implementations that normally don't surrender their setgid permission.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
If, for example, you want to create a sub-directory of personal device cache file paths by using the LSOFPERSDCPATH environment variable to name it, and <i>lsof</i> doesn't surrender its setgid permission, you will have to allow <i>lsof</i> to create device cache files at the standard personal path and move them to your subdirectory with shell commands.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The local system administrator may: disable this option when <i>lsof</i> is built; change the name of the environment variable from LSOFPERSDCPATH to something else; change the HASPERSDC format to include the personal path component in another place; or exclude the personal path component entirely. Consult the output of the <b>-D?</b> option for the environment variable's name and the HASPERSDC format specification.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1> Errors are identified with messages on the standard error file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> returns a one (1) if any error was detected, including the failure to locate command names, file names, Internet addresses or files, login names, NFS files, PIDs, PGIDs, or UIDs it was asked to list. If the <b>-V</b> option is specified, <i>lsof</i> will indicate the search items it failed to list.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It returns a zero (0) if no errors were detected and if it was able to list some information about all the specified search arguments.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <i>lsof</i> cannot open access to <i>/dev</i> (or <i>/devices</i>) or one of its subdirectories, or get information on a file in them with <i>stat</i>(2), it issues a warning message and continues. That <i>lsof</i> will issue warning messages about inaccessible files in <i>/dev</i> (or <i>/devices</i>) is indicated in its help output - requested with the <b>-h</b> or &gt;B -? options -  with the message:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
	Inaccessible /dev warnings are enabled.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The warning message may be suppressed with the <b>-w</b> option. It may also have been suppressed by the system administrator when <i>lsof</i> was compiled by the setting of the WARNDEVACCESS definition. In this case, the output from the help options will include the message:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
	Inaccessible /dev warnings are disabled.<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Inaccessible device warning messages usually disappear after <i>lsof</i> has created a working device cache file.</div>

<h1>BUGS</h1> Since <i>lsof</i> reads kernel memory in its search for open files, rapid changes in kernel memory may produce unpredictable results.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a file has multiple record locks, the lock status character (following the file descriptor) is derived from a test of the first lock structure, not from any combination of the individual record locks that might be described by multiple lock structures.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> can't search for files with restrictive access permissions by <i>name</i> unless it is installed with root set-UID permission. Otherwise it is limited to searching for files to which its user or its set-GID group (if any) has access permission.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The display of the destination address of a raw socket (e.g., for <i>ping</i>) depends on the UNIX operating system. Some dialects store the destination address in the raw socket's protocol control block, some do not.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> can't always represent Solaris device numbers in the same way that <i>ls</i>(1) does. For example, the major and minor device numbers that the <i>lstat</i>(2) and <i>stat</i>(2) functions report for the directory on which CD-ROM files are mounted (typically <i>/cdrom</i>) are not the same as the ones that it reports for the device on which CD-ROM files are mounted (typically <i>/dev/sr0</i>). ( <i>Lsof</i> reports the directory numbers.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The support for <i>/proc</i> file systems is available only for BSD and Tru64 UNIX dialects, Linux, and dialects derived from SYSV R4 - e.g., FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, UnixWare.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some <i>/proc</i> file items - device number, inode number, and file size - are unavailable in some dialects. Searching for files in a <i>/proc</i> file system may require that the full path name be specified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
No text (<b>txt</b>) file descriptors are displayed for Linux processes. All entries for files other than the current working directory, the root directory, and numerical file descriptors are labeled <b>mem</b> descriptors.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> can't search for Tru64 UNIX named pipes by name, because their kernel implementation of lstat(2) returns an improper device number for a named pipe.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>Lsof</i> can't report fully or correctly on HP-UX 9.01, 10.20, and 11.00 locks because of insufficient access to kernel data or errors in the kernel data. See the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The  <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for details.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The AIX SMT file type is a fabrication. It's made up for file structures whose type (15) isn't defined in the AIX <i>/usr/include/sys/file.h</i> header file. One way to create such file structures is to run X clients with the DISPLAY variable set to ``:0.0''.<div class="spacer">

The <b>+|-f</b><i>[cfgGn]</i> option is not supported under /proc-based Linux <i>lsof</i>, because it doesn't read kernel structures from kernel memory.</div>
