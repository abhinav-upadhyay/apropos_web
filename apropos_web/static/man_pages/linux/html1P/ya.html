<h1>NAME</h1> yacc - yet another compiler compiler ( <b>DEVELOPMENT</b>)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>  <b>yacc</b> <b>[</b><b>-dltv</b><b>][</b><b>-b</b> <i>file_prefix</i><b>][</b><b>-p</b>  <i>sym_prefix</i><b>]</b> <i>grammar</i><b></b></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>yacc</i> utility shall read a description of a context-free grammar in  <i>grammar</i> and write C source code, conforming to the ISO&#160;C standard, to a code file, and optionally header information into a header file, in the current directory. The C code shall define a function and related routines and macros for an automaton that executes a parsing algorithm meeting the requirements in Algorithms .<div class="spacer">
</div>
The form and meaning of the grammar are described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The C source code and header file shall be produced in a form suitable as input for the C compiler (see  <i>c99</i> ).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> The  <i>yacc</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following options shall be supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-b&#160;</b> <i>file_prefix</i></dt>
<dd>
Use <i>file_prefix</i> instead of <b>y</b> as the prefix for all output filenames. The code file  <b>y.tab.c</b>, the header file  <b>y.tab.h</b> (created when <b>-d</b> is specified), and the description file  <b>y.output</b> (created when <b>-v</b> is specified), shall be changed to  <i>file_prefix</i> <b>.tab.c</b>, <i>file_prefix</i>  <b>.tab.h</b>, and <i>file_prefix</i>  <b>.output</b>, respectively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-d</b></dt>
<dd>
Write the header file; by default only the code file is written. The  <b>#define</b> statements associate the token codes assigned by  <i>yacc</i> with the user-declared token names. This allows source files other than  <b>y.tab.c</b> to access the token codes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-l</b></dt>
<dd>
Produce a code file that does not contain any <b>#line</b> constructs. If this option is not present, it is unspecified whether the code file or header file contains  <b>#line</b> directives. This should only be used after the grammar and the associated actions are fully debugged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-p&#160;</b> <i>sym_prefix</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use <i>sym_prefix</i> instead of <b>yy</b> as the prefix for all external names produced by  <i>yacc</i>. The names affected shall include the functions  <i>yyparse</i>(), <i>yylex</i>(), and <i>yyerror</i>(), and the variables  <i>yylval</i>, <i>yychar</i>, and  <i>yydebug</i>. (In the remainder of this section, the six symbols cited are referenced using their default names only as a notational convenience.) Local names may also be affected by the  <b>-p</b> option; however, the  <b>-p</b> option shall not affect  <b>#define</b> symbols generated by <i>yacc</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-t</b></dt>
<dd>
Modify conditional compilation directives to permit compilation of debugging code in the code file. Runtime debugging statements shall always be contained in the code file, but by default conditional compilation directives prevent their compilation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-v</b></dt>
<dd>
Write a file containing a description of the parser and a report of conflicts generated by ambiguities in the grammar.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPERANDS</h1> The following operand is required:<dl>
<dt>
<i>grammar</i></dt>
<dd>
A pathname of a file containing instructions, hereafter called <i>grammar</i>, for which a parser is to be created. The format for the grammar is described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h1>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h1> The following environment variables shall affect the execution of  <i>yacc</i>:<dl>
<dt>
<i>LANG</i></dt>
<dd>
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)</dd>

<i>LC_CTYPE</i></dt>
<dd>
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>LC_MESSAGES</i></dt>
<dd>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.</dd>

<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>LANG</i> and <i>LC_*</i> variables affect the execution of the  <i>yacc</i> utility as stated. The <i>main</i>() function defined in Yacc Library shall call:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<br/>
<b>setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;&quot;)</b><br/>

and thus the program generated by <i>yacc</i> shall also be affected by the contents of these variables at runtime.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h1> Default.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>STDOUT</h1> Not used.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>STDERR</h1> If shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts are detected in  <i>grammar</i>,  <i>yacc</i> shall write a report of those conflicts to the standard error in an unspecified format.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Standard error shall also be used for diagnostic messages.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OUTPUT FILES</h1> The code file, the header file, and the description file shall be text files. All are described in the following sections.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Code File</h2> This file shall contain the C source code for the  <i>yyparse</i>() function. It shall contain code for the various semantic actions with macro substitution performed on them as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section. It also shall contain a copy of the  <b>#define</b> statements in the header file. If a <b>%union</b> declaration is used, the declaration for YYSTYPE shall also be included in this file.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Header File</h2> The header file shall contain  <b>#define</b> statements that associate the token numbers with the token names. This allows source files other than the code file to access the token codes. If a  <b>%union</b> declaration is used, the declaration for YYSTYPE and an  <i>extern YYSTYPE yylval</i> declaration shall also be included in this file.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Description File</h2> The description file shall be a text file containing a description of the state machine corresponding to the parser, using an unspecified format. Limits for internal tables (see Limits ) shall also be reported, in an implementation-defined manner. (Some implementations may use dynamic allocation techniques and have no specific limit values to report.)</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>yacc</i> command accepts a language that is used to define a grammar for a target language to be parsed by the tables and code generated by  <i>yacc</i>. The language accepted by <i>yacc</i> as a grammar for the target language is described below using the  <i>yacc</i> input language itself.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The input <i>grammar</i> includes rules describing the input structure of the target language and code to be invoked when these rules are recognized to provide the associated semantic action. The code to be executed shall appear as bodies of text that are intended to be C-language code. The C-language inclusions are presumed to form a correct function when processed by  <i>yacc</i> into its output files. The code included in this way shall be executed during the recognition of the target language.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Given a grammar, the <i>yacc</i> utility generates the files described in the OUTPUT FILES section. The code file can be compiled and linked using  <i>c99</i>. If the declaration and programs sections of the grammar file did not include definitions of  <i>main</i>(), <i>yylex</i>(), and  <i>yyerror</i>(), the compiled output requires linking with externally supplied versions of those functions. Default versions of  <i>main</i>() and <i>yyerror</i>() are supplied in the  <i>yacc</i> library and can be linked in by using the <b>-l&#160;y</b> operand to  <i>c99</i>. The  <i>yacc</i> library interfaces need not support interfaces with other than the default  <b>yy</b> symbol prefix. The application provides the lexical analyzer function,  <i>yylex</i>(); the <i>lex</i> utility is specifically designed to generate such a routine.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Input Language</h2> The application shall ensure that every specification file consists of three sections in order:  <i>declarations</i>, <i>grammar</i>  <i>rules</i>, and <i>programs</i>, separated by double percent signs (  <b>&quot;%%&quot;</b> ). The declarations and programs sections can be empty. If the latter is empty, the preceding  <b>&quot;%%&quot;</b> mark separating it from the rules section can be omitted.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The input is free form text following the structure of the grammar defined below.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Lexical Structure of the Grammar</h2> The &lt;blank&gt;s, &lt;newline&gt;s, and &lt;form-feed&gt;s shall be ignored, except that the application shall ensure that they do not appear in names or multi-character reserved symbols. Comments shall be enclosed in  <b>&quot;/*&#160;...&#160;*/&quot;</b>, and can appear wherever a name is valid.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Names are of arbitrary length, made up of letters, periods ( <b>'.'</b> ), underscores (  <b>'_'</b> ), and non-initial digits. Uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct. Conforming applications shall not use names beginning in  <b>yy</b> or  <b>YY</b> since the <i>yacc</i> parser uses such names. Many of the names appear in the final output of  <i>yacc</i>, and thus they should be chosen to conform with any additional rules created by the C compiler to be used. In particular they appear in  <b>#define</b> statements.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A literal shall consist of a single character enclosed in single-quotes (  <b>'&quot;</b> ). All of the escape sequences supported for character constants by the ISO&#160;C standard shall be supported by  <i>yacc</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The relationship with the lexical analyzer is discussed in detail below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The application shall ensure that the NUL character is not used in grammar rules or literals.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Declarations Section</h2> The declarations section is used to define the symbols used to define the target language and their relationship with each other. In particular, much of the additional information required to resolve ambiguities in the context-free grammar for the target language is provided here.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Usually <i>yacc</i> assigns the relationship between the symbolic names it generates and their underlying numeric value. The declarations section makes it possible to control the assignment of these values.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is also possible to keep semantic information associated with the tokens currently on the parse stack in a user-defined C-language  <b>union</b>, if the members of the union are associated with the various names in the grammar. The declarations section provides for this as well.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first group of declarators below all take a list of names as arguments. That list can optionally be preceded by the name of a C union member (called a  <i>tag</i> below) appearing within <b>'&lt;'</b> and  <b>'&gt;'</b> . (As an exception to the typographical conventions of the rest of this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, in this case &lt; <i>tag</i>&gt; does not represent a metavariable, but the literal angle bracket characters surrounding a symbol.) The use of  <i>tag</i> specifies that the tokens named on this line shall be of the same C type as the union member referenced by  <i>tag</i>. This is discussed in more detail below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For lists used to define tokens, the first appearance of a given token can be followed by a positive integer (as a string of decimal digits). If this is done, the underlying value assigned to it for lexical purposes shall be taken to be that number.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following declares <i>name</i> to be a token:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>%token</b> <b>[</b><b>&lt;</b><i>tag</i><b>&gt;</b><b>]</b> <i>name</i> <b>[</b><i>number</i><b>][</b><i>name</i> <b>[</b><i>number</i><b>]]</b><b>...</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>tag</i> is present, the C type for all tokens on this line shall be declared to be the type referenced by  <i>tag</i>. If a positive integer,  <i>number</i>, follows a <i>name</i>, that value shall be assigned to the token.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following declares <i>name</i> to be a token, and assigns precedence to it:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>%left</b> <b>[</b><b>&lt;</b><i>tag</i><b>&gt;</b><b>]</b> <i>name</i> <b>[</b><i>number</i><b>][</b><i>name</i> <b>[</b><i>number</i><b>]]</b><b>...</b><br/>
<b>%right</b> <b>[</b><b>&lt;</b><i>tag</i><b>&gt;</b><b>]</b> <i>name</i> <b>[</b><i>number</i><b>][</b><i>name</i> <b>[</b><i>number</i><b>]]</b><b>...</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
One or more lines, each beginning with one of these symbols, can appear in this section. All tokens on the same line have the same precedence level and associativity; the lines are in order of increasing precedence or binding strength.  <b>%left</b> denotes that the operators on that line are left associative, and  <b>%right</b> similarly denotes right associative operators. If  <i>tag</i> is present, it shall declare a C type for <i>name</i>s as described for  <b>%token</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following declares <i>name</i> to be a token, and indicates that this cannot be used associatively:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>%nonassoc</b> <b>[</b><b>&lt;</b><i>tag</i><b>&gt;</b><b>]</b> <i>name</i> <b>[</b><i>number</i><b>][</b><i>name</i> <b>[</b><i>number</i><b>]]</b><b>...</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the parser encounters associative use of this token it reports an error. If  <i>tag</i> is present, it shall declare a C type for  <i>name</i>s as described for <b>%token</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following declares that union member <i>name</i>s are non-terminals, and thus it is required to have a  <i>tag</i> field at its beginning:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>%type &lt;</b><i>tag</i><b>&gt;</b> <i>name</i><b>...</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Because it deals with non-terminals only, assigning a token number or using a literal is also prohibited. If this construct is present,  <i>yacc</i> shall perform type checking; if this construct is not present, the parse stack shall hold only the  <b>int</b> type.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Every name used in <i>grammar</i> not defined by a <b>%token</b>, <b>%left</b>,  <b>%right</b>, or <b>%nonassoc</b> declaration is assumed to represent a non-terminal symbol. The  <i>yacc</i> utility shall report an error for any non-terminal symbol that does not appear on the left side of at least one grammar rule.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Once the type, precedence, or token number of a name is specified, it shall not be changed. If the first declaration of a token does not assign a token number,  <i>yacc</i> shall assign a token number. Once this assignment is made, the token number shall not be changed by explicit assignment.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following declarators do not follow the previous pattern.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following declares the non-terminal <i>name</i> to be the <i>start</i>  <i>symbol</i>, which represents the largest, most general structure described by the grammar rules:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>%start</b> <i>name</i><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
By default, it is the left-hand side of the first grammar rule; this default can be overridden with this declaration.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following declares the <i>yacc</i> value stack to be a union of the various types of values desired:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>%union {</b> <i>body of union</i> <b>(</b><i>in C</i><b>) }</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
By default, the values returned by actions (see below) and the lexical analyzer shall be of type  <b>int</b>. The <i>yacc</i> utility keeps track of types, and it shall insert corresponding union member names in order to perform strict type checking of the resulting parser.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Alternatively, given that at least one &lt;<i>tag</i>&gt; construct is used, the union can be declared in a header file (which shall be included in the declarations section by using a  <b>#include</b> construct within  <b>%{</b> and <b>%}</b>), and a  <b>typedef</b> used to define the symbol YYSTYPE to represent this union. The effect of  <b>%union</b> is to provide the declaration of YYSTYPE directly from the  <i>yacc</i> input.<div class="spacer">
</div>
C-language declarations and definitions can appear in the declarations section, enclosed by the following marks:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>%{ ... %}</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
These statements shall be copied into the code file, and have global scope within it so that they can be used in the rules and program sections.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The application shall ensure that the declarations section is terminated by the token  <b>%%</b>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Grammar Rules in yacc</h2> The rules section defines the context-free grammar to be accepted by the function  <i>yacc</i> generates, and associates with those rules C-language actions and additional precedence information. The grammar is described below, and a formal definition follows.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The rules section is comprised of one or more grammar rules. A grammar rule has the form:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>A : BODY ;</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The symbol <b>A</b> represents a non-terminal name, and <b>BODY</b> represents a sequence of zero or more  <i>name</i>s,  <i>literal</i>s, and <i>semantic action</i>s that can then be followed by optional  <i>precedence rule</i>s. Only the names and literals participate in the formation of the grammar; the semantic actions and precedence rules are used in other ways. The colon and the semicolon are  <i>yacc</i> punctuation. If there are several successive grammar rules with the same left-hand side, the vertical bar  <b>'|'</b> can be used to avoid rewriting the left-hand side; in this case the semicolon appears only after the last rule. The BODY part can be empty (or empty of names and literals) to indicate that the non-terminal symbol matches the empty string.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>yacc</i> utility assigns a unique number to each rule. Rules using the vertical bar notation are distinct rules. The number assigned to the rule appears in the description file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The elements comprising a BODY are:<dl>
<dt>
<i>name</i>,&#160;<i>literal</i></dt>
<dd>
These form the rules of the grammar: <i>name</i> is either a <i>token</i> or a  <i>non-terminal</i>; <i>literal</i> stands for itself (less the lexically required quotation marks).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>semantic action</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With each grammar rule, the user can associate actions to be performed each time the rule is recognized in the input process. (Note that the word &quot;action&quot; can also refer to the actions of the parser-shift, reduce, and so on.)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
These actions can return values and can obtain the values returned by previous actions. These values are kept in objects of type YYSTYPE (see  <b>%union</b>). The result value of the action shall be kept on the parse stack with the left-hand side of the rule, to be accessed by other reductions as part of their right-hand side. By using the &lt; <i>tag</i>&gt; information provided in the declarations section, the code generated by  <i>yacc</i> can be strictly type checked and contain arbitrary information. In addition, the lexical analyzer can provide the same kinds of values for tokens, if desired.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An action is an arbitrary C statement and as such can do input or output, call subprograms, and alter external variables. An action is one or more C statements enclosed in curly braces  <b>'{'</b> and  <b>'}'</b> .<div class="spacer">
</div>
Certain pseudo-variables can be used in the action. These are macros for access to data structures known internally to  <i>yacc</i>.<dl>
<dt>
$$</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
The value of the action can be set by assigning it to $$. If type checking is enabled and the type of the value to be assigned cannot be determined, a diagnostic message may be generated.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
$<i>number</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
This refers to the value returned by the component specified by the token  <i>number</i> in the right side of a rule, reading from left to right;  <i>number</i> can be zero or negative. If <i>number</i> is zero or negative, it refers to the data associated with the name on the parser's stack preceding the leftmost symbol of the current rule. (That is,  <b>&quot;$0&quot;</b> refers to the name immediately preceding the leftmost name in the current rule to be found on the parser's stack and  <b>&quot;$-1&quot;</b> refers to the symbol to  <i>its</i> left.) If <i>number</i> refers to an element past the current point in the rule, or beyond the bottom of the stack, the result is undefined. If type checking is enabled and the type of the value to be assigned cannot be determined, a diagnostic message may be generated.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
$&lt;<i>tag</i>&gt;<i>number</i></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
These correspond exactly to the corresponding symbols without the  <i>tag</i> inclusion, but allow for strict type checking (and preclude unwanted type conversions). The effect is that the macro is expanded to use  <i>tag</i> to select an element from the YYSTYPE union (using  <i>dataname.tag</i>). This is particularly useful if  <i>number</i> is not positive.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
$&lt;<i>tag</i>&gt;$</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
This imposes on the reference the type of the union member referenced by  <i>tag</i>. This construction is applicable when a reference to a left context value occurs in the grammar, and provides  <i>yacc</i> with a means for selecting a type.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Actions can occur anywhere in a rule (not just at the end); an action can access values returned by actions to its left, and in turn the value it returns can be accessed by actions to its right. An action appearing in the middle of a rule shall be equivalent to replacing the action with a new non-terminal symbol and adding an empty rule with that non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side. The semantic action associated with the new rule shall be equivalent to the original action. The use of actions within rules might introduce conflicts that would not otherwise exist.<div class="spacer">
</div>
By default, the value of a rule shall be the value of the first element in it. If the first element does not have a type (particularly in the case of a literal) and type checking is turned on by  <b>%type</b>, an error message shall result.<dl>
<dt>
<i>precedence</i></dt>
<dd>
The keyword <b>%prec</b> can be used to change the precedence level associated with a particular grammar rule. Examples of this are in cases where a unary and binary operator have the same symbolic representation, but need to be given different precedences, or where the handling of an ambiguous if-else construction is necessary. The reserved symbol  <b>%prec</b> can appear immediately after the body of the grammar rule and can be followed by a token name or a literal. It shall cause the precedence of the grammar rule to become that of the following token name or literal. The action for the rule as a whole can follow  <b>%prec</b>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a program section follows, the application shall ensure that the grammar rules are terminated by  <b>%%</b>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Programs Section</h2> The  <i>programs</i> section can include the definition of the lexical analyzer  <i>yylex</i>(), and any other functions; for example, those used in the actions specified in the grammar rules. It is unspecified whether the programs section precedes or follows the semantic actions in the output file; therefore, if the application contains any macro definitions and declarations intended to apply to the code in the semantic actions, it shall place them within  <b>&quot;%{&#160;...&#160;%}&quot;</b> in the declarations section.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Input Grammar</h2> The following input to  <i>yacc</i> yields a parser for the input to  <i>yacc</i>. This formal syntax takes precedence over the preceding text syntax description.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The lexical structure is defined less precisely; Lexical Structure of the Grammar defines most terms. The correspondence between the previous terms and the tokens below is as follows.<dl>
<dt>
<b>IDENTIFIER</b></dt>
<dd>
This corresponds to the concept of <i>name</i>, given previously. It also includes literals as defined previously.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

<h2>Conflicts</h2> The parser produced for an input grammar may contain states in which conflicts occur. The conflicts occur because the grammar is not LALR(1). An ambiguous grammar always contains at least one LALR(1) conflict. The  <i>yacc</i> utility shall resolve all conflicts, using either default rules or user-specified precedence rules.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Conflicts are either shift/reduce conflicts or reduce/reduce conflicts. A shift/reduce conflict is where, for a given state and lookahead symbol, both a shift action and a reduce action are possible. A reduce/reduce conflict is where, for a given state and lookahead symbol, reductions by two different rules are possible.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The rules below describe how to specify what actions to take when a conflict occurs. Not all shift/reduce conflicts can be successfully resolved this way because the conflict may be due to something other than ambiguity, so incautious use of these facilities can cause the language accepted by the parser to be much different from that which was intended. The description file shall contain sufficient information to understand the cause of the conflict. Where ambiguity is the reason either the default or explicit rules should be adequate to produce a working parser.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The declared precedences and associativities (see Declarations Section ) are used to resolve parsing conflicts as follows:<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
A precedence and associativity is associated with each grammar rule; it is the precedence and associativity of the last token or literal in the body of the rule. If the  <b>%prec</b> keyword is used, it overrides this default. Some grammar rules might not have both precedence and associativity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
If there is a shift/reduce conflict, and both the grammar rule and the input symbol have precedence and associativity associated with them, then the conflict is resolved in favor of the action (shift or reduce) associated with the higher precedence. If the precedences are the same, then the associativity is used; left associative implies reduce, right associative implies shift, and non-associative implies an error in the string being parsed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 3.</dt>
<dd>
When there is a shift/reduce conflict that cannot be resolved by rule 2, the shift is done. Conflicts resolved this way are counted in the diagnostic output described in Error Handling .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 4.</dt>
<dd>
When there is a reduce/reduce conflict, a reduction is done by the grammar rule that occurs earlier in the input sequence. Conflicts resolved this way are counted in the diagnostic output described in Error Handling .</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Conflicts resolved by precedence or associativity shall not be counted in the shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts reported by  <i>yacc</i> on either standard error or in the description file.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Error Handling</h2> The token  <b>error</b> shall be reserved for error handling. The name  <b>error</b> can be used in grammar rules. It indicates places where the parser can recover from a syntax error. The default value of  <b>error</b> shall be 256. Its value can be changed using a  <b>%token</b> declaration. The lexical analyzer should not return the value of  <b>error</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The parser shall detect a syntax error when it is in a state where the action associated with the lookahead symbol is  <b>error</b>. A semantic action can cause the parser to initiate error handling by executing the macro YYERROR. When YYERROR is executed, the semantic action passes control back to the parser. YYERROR cannot be used outside of semantic actions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the parser detects a syntax error, it normally calls <i>yyerror</i>() with the character string  <b>&quot;syntax&#160;error&quot;</b> as its argument. The call shall not be made if the parser is still recovering from a previous error when the error is detected. The parser is considered to be recovering from a previous error until the parser has shifted over at least three normal input symbols since the last error was detected or a semantic action has executed the macro  <i>yyerrok</i>. The parser shall not call  <i>yyerror</i>() when YYERROR is executed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The macro function YYRECOVERING shall return 1 if a syntax error has been detected and the parser has not yet fully recovered from it. Otherwise, zero shall be returned.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a syntax error is detected by the parser, the parser shall check if a previous syntax error has been detected. If a previous error was detected, and if no normal input symbols have been shifted since the preceding error was detected, the parser checks if the lookahead symbol is an endmarker (see Interface to the Lexical Analyzer ). If it is, the parser shall return with a non-zero value. Otherwise, the lookahead symbol shall be discarded and normal parsing shall resume.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When YYERROR is executed or when the parser detects a syntax error and no previous error has been detected, or at least one normal input symbol has been shifted since the previous error was detected, the parser shall pop back one state at a time until the parse stack is empty or the current state allows a shift over  <b>error</b>. If the parser empties the parse stack, it shall return with a non-zero value. Otherwise, it shall shift over  <b>error</b> and then resume normal parsing. If the parser reads a lookahead symbol before the error was detected, that symbol shall still be the lookahead symbol when parsing is resumed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The macro <i>yyerrok</i> in a semantic action shall cause the parser to act as if it has fully recovered from any previous errors. The macro  <i>yyclearin</i> shall cause the parser to discard the current lookahead token. If the current lookahead token has not yet been read,  <i>yyclearin</i> shall have no effect.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The macro YYACCEPT shall cause the parser to return with the value zero. The macro YYABORT shall cause the parser to return with a non-zero value.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Interface to the Lexical Analyzer</h2> The  <i>yylex</i>() function is an integer-valued function that returns a  <i>token number</i> representing the kind of token read. If there is a value associated with the token returned by  <i>yylex</i>() (see the discussion of  <i>tag</i> above), it shall be assigned to the external variable  <i>yylval</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the parser and <i>yylex</i>() do not agree on these token numbers, reliable communication between them cannot occur. For (single-byte character) literals, the token is simply the numeric value of the character in the current character set. The numbers for other tokens can either be chosen by  <i>yacc</i>, or chosen by the user. In either case, the  <b>#define</b> construct of C is used to allow  <i>yylex</i>() to return these numbers symbolically. The  <b>#define</b> statements are put into the code file, and the header file if that file is requested. The set of characters permitted by  <i>yacc</i> in an identifier is larger than that permitted by C. Token names found to contain such characters shall not be included in the  <b>#define</b> declarations.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the token numbers are chosen by <i>yacc</i>, the tokens other than literals shall be assigned numbers greater than 256, although no order is implied. A token can be explicitly assigned a number by following its first appearance in the declarations section with a number. Names and literals not defined this way retain their default definition. All token numbers assigned by  <i>yacc</i> shall be unique and distinct from the token numbers used for literals and user-assigned tokens. If duplicate token numbers cause conflicts in parser generation,  <i>yacc</i> shall report an error; otherwise, it is unspecified whether the token assignment is accepted or an error is reported.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The end of the input is marked by a special token called the <i>endmarker</i>, which has a token number that is zero or negative. (These values are invalid for any other token.) All lexical analyzers shall return zero or negative as a token number upon reaching the end of their input. If the tokens up to, but excluding, the endmarker form a structure that matches the start symbol, the parser shall accept the input. If the endmarker is seen in any other context, it shall be considered an error.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Completing the Program</h2> In addition to  <i>yyparse</i>() and <i>yylex</i>(), the functions <i>yyerror</i>() and  <i>main</i>() are required to make a complete program. The application can supply  <i>main</i>() and <i>yyerror</i>(), or those routines can be obtained from the  <i>yacc</i> library.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Yacc Library</h2> The following functions shall appear only in the  <i>yacc</i> library accessible through the  <b>-l&#160;y</b> operand to <i>c99</i>; they can therefore be redefined by a conforming application:<dl>
<dt>
<b>int&#160;</b> <i>main</i>(<b>void</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This function shall call <i>yyparse</i>() and exit with an unspecified value. Other actions within this function are unspecified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>int&#160;</b> <i>yyerror</i>(<b>const&#160;char</b>&#160;*<i>s</i>)</dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This function shall write the NUL-terminated argument to standard error, followed by a &lt;newline&gt;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The order of the <b>-l&#160;y</b> and <b>-l&#160;l</b> operands given to <i>c99</i> is significant; the application shall either provide its own  <i>main</i>() function or ensure that  <b>-l&#160;y</b> precedes  <b>-l&#160;l</b>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Debugging the Parser</h2> The parser generated by  <i>yacc</i> shall have diagnostic facilities in it that can be optionally enabled at either compile time or at runtime (if enabled at compile time). The compilation of the runtime debugging code is under the control of YYDEBUG, a preprocessor symbol. If YYDEBUG has a non-zero value, the debugging code shall be included. If its value is zero, the code shall not be included.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In parsers where the debugging code has been included, the external  <b>int</b> <i>yydebug</i> can be used to turn debugging on (with a non-zero value) and off (zero value) at runtime. The initial value of  <i>yydebug</i> shall be zero.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <b>-t</b> is specified, the code file shall be built such that, if YYDEBUG is not already defined at compilation time (using the  <i>c99</i> <b>-D</b> YYDEBUG option, for example), YYDEBUG shall be set explicitly to 1. When  <b>-t</b> is not specified, the code file shall be built such that, if YYDEBUG is not already defined, it shall be set explicitly to zero.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The format of the debugging output is unspecified but includes at least enough information to determine the shift and reduce actions, and the input symbols. It also provides information about error recovery.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Algorithms</h2> The parser constructed by  <i>yacc</i> implements an LALR(1) parsing algorithm as documented in the literature. It is unspecified whether the parser is table-driven or direct-coded.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A parser generated by <i>yacc</i> shall never request an input symbol from  <i>yylex</i>() while in a state where the only actions other than the error action are reductions by a single rule.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The literature of parsing theory defines these concepts.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Limits</h2> The  <i>yacc</i> utility may have several internal tables. The minimum maximums for these tables are shown in the following table. The exact meaning of these values is implementation-defined. The implementation shall define the relationship between these values and between them and any error messages that the implementation may generate should it run out of space for any internal structure. An implementation may combine groups of these resources into a single pool as long as the total available to the user does not fall below the sum of the sizes specified by this section.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

<h1>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h1> If any errors are encountered, the run is aborted and  <i>yacc</i> exits with a non-zero status. Partial code files and header files may be produced.

</div>
<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> Historical implementations experience name conflicts on the names  <b>yacc.tmp</b>, <b>yacc.acts</b>, <b>yacc.debug</b>,  <b>y.tab.c</b>, <b>y.tab.h</b>, and <b>y.output</b> if more than one copy of  <i>yacc</i> is running in a single directory at one time. The  <b>-b</b> option was added to overcome this problem. The related problem of allowing multiple  <i>yacc</i> parsers to be placed in the same file was addressed by adding a  <b>-p</b> option to override the previously hard-coded  <b>yy</b> variable prefix.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The description of the <b>-p</b> option specifies the minimal set of function and variable names that cause conflict when multiple parsers are linked together. YYSTYPE does not need to be changed. Instead, the programmer can use  <b>-b</b> to give the header files for different parsers different names, and then the file with the  <i>yylex</i>() for a given parser can include the header for that parser. Names such as  <i>yyclearerr</i> do not need to be changed because they are used only in the actions; they do not have linkage. It is possible that an implementation has other names, either internal ones for implementing things such as  <i>yyclearerr</i>, or providing non-standard features that it wants to change with  <b>-p</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unary operators that are the same token as a binary operator in general need their precedence adjusted. This is handled by the  <b>%prec</b> advisory symbol associated with the particular grammar rule defining that unary operator. (See Grammar Rules in yacc .) Applications are not required to use this operator for unary operators, but the grammars that do not require it are rare.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> Access to the  <i>yacc</i> library is obtained with library search operands to  <i>c99</i>. To use the  <i>yacc</i> library <i>main</i>():<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h1>RATIONALE</h1> The references in may be helpful in constructing the parser generator. The referenced DeRemer and Pennello article (along with the works it references) describes a technique to generate parsers that conform to this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001. Work in this area continues to be done, so implementors should consult current literature before doing any new implementations. The original Knuth article is the theoretical basis for this kind of parser, but the tables it generates are impractically large for reasonable grammars and should not be used. The &quot;equivalent to&quot; wording is intentional to assure that the best tables that are LALR(1) can be generated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There has been confusion between the class of grammars, the algorithms needed to generate parsers, and the algorithms needed to parse the languages. They are all reasonably orthogonal. In particular, a parser generator that accepts the full range of LR(1) grammars need not generate a table any more complex than one that accepts SLR(1) (a relatively weak class of LR grammars) for a grammar that happens to be SLR(1). Such an implementation need not recognize the case, either; table compression can yield the SLR(1) table (or one even smaller than that) without recognizing that the grammar is SLR(1). The speed of an LR(1) parser for any class is dependent more upon the table representation and compression (or the code generation if a direct parser is generated) than upon the class of grammar that the table generator handles.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The speed of the parser generator is somewhat dependent upon the class of grammar it handles. However, the original Knuth article algorithms for constructing LR parsers were judged by its author to be impractically slow at that time. Although full LR is more complex than LALR(1), as computer speeds and algorithms improve, the difference (in terms of acceptable wall-clock execution time) is becoming less significant.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Potential authors are cautioned that the referenced DeRemer and Pennello article previously cited identifies a bug (an over-simplification of the computation of LALR(1) lookahead sets) in some of the LALR(1) algorithm statements that preceded it to publication. They should take the time to seek out that paper, as well as current relevant work, particularly Aho's.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>-b</b> option was added to provide a portable method for permitting  <i>yacc</i> to work on multiple separate parsers in the same directory. If a directory contains more than one  <i>yacc</i> grammar, and both grammars are constructed at the same time (by, for example, a parallel  <i>make</i> program), conflict results. While the solution is not historical practice, it corrects a known deficiency in historical implementations. Corresponding changes were made to all sections that referenced the filenames  <b>y.tab.c</b> (now &quot;the code file&quot;),  <b>y.tab.h</b> (now &quot;the header file&quot;), and <b>y.output</b> (now &quot;the description file&quot;).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The grammar for <i>yacc</i> input is based on System V documentation. The textual description shows there that the  <b>';'</b> is required at the end of the rule. The grammar and the implementation do not require this. (The use of  <b>C_IDENTIFIER</b> causes a reduce to occur in the right place.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Also, in that implementation, the constructs such as <b>%token</b> can be terminated by a semicolon, but this is not permitted by the grammar. The keywords such as  <b>%token</b> can also appear in uppercase, which is again not discussed. In most places where  <b>'%'</b> is used, <b>'\'</b> can be substituted, and there are alternate spellings for some of the symbols (for example,  <b>%LEFT</b> can be <b>&quot;%&lt;&quot;</b> or even <b>&quot;\&lt;&quot;</b> ).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Historically, &lt;<i>tag</i>&gt; can contain any characters except <b>'&gt;'</b>, including white space, in the implementation. However, since the  <i>tag</i> must reference an ISO&#160;C standard union member, in practice conforming implementations need to support only the set of characters for ISO&#160;C standard identifiers in this context.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some historical implementations are known to accept actions that are terminated by a period. Historical implementations often allow  <b>'$'</b> in names. A conforming implementation does not need to support either of these behaviors.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Deciding when to use <b>%prec</b> illustrates the difficulty in specifying the behavior of  <i>yacc</i>. There may be situations in which the  <i>grammar</i> is not, strictly speaking, in error, and yet  <i>yacc</i> cannot interpret it unambiguously. The resolution of ambiguities in the grammar can in many instances be resolved by providing additional information, such as using  <b>%type</b> or <b>%union</b> declarations. It is often easier and it usually yields a smaller parser to take this alternative when it is appropriate.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The size and execution time of a program produced without the runtime debugging code is usually smaller and slightly faster in historical implementations.<div class="spacer">

Statistics messages from several historical implementations include the following types of information:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

</div>
The report of internal tables in the description file is left implementation-defined because all aspects of these limits are also implementation-defined. Some implementations may use dynamic allocation techniques and have no specific limit values to report.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The format of the <b>y.output</b> file is not given because specification of the format was not seen to enhance applications portability. The listing is primarily intended to help human users understand and debug the parser; use of  <b>y.output</b> by a conforming application script would be unusual. Furthermore, implementations have not produced consistent output and no popular format was apparent. The format selected by the implementation should be human-readable, in addition to the requirement that it be a text file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Standard error reports are not specifically described because they are seldom of use to conforming applications and there was no reason to restrict implementations.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some implementations recognize <b>&quot;={&quot;</b> as equivalent to <b>'{'</b> because it appears in historical documentation. This construction was recognized and documented as obsolete as long ago as 1978, in the referenced  <i>Yacc: Yet Another</i>  <i>Compiler-Compiler</i>. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 chose to leave it as obsolete and omit it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Multi-byte characters should be recognized by the lexical analyzer and returned as tokens. They should not be returned as multi-byte character literals. The token  <b>error</b> that is used for error recovery is normally assigned the value 256 in the historical implementation. Thus, the token value 256, which is used in many multi-byte character sets, is not available for use as the value of a user-defined token.</div>
