<h1>NAME</h1> CPANPLUS::Hacking</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This document attempts to describe how to develop with the CPANPLUS environment most easily, how certain things work and why.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is basically a quick-start guide to people who want to add features or patches to CPANPLUS.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OBTAINING CPANPLUS</h1> Checkout CPANPLUS from its Subversion repository at http://oss.dwim.org/cpanplus-devel &lt;http://oss.dwim.org/cpanplus-devel&gt; .</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>INSTALLING CPANPLUS</h1> CPANPLUS follows the standard perl module installation process:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    perl Makefile.PL<br/>
    make<br/>
    make test<br/>
    make install<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFIGURING CPANPLUS</h1> When running &quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot; you will be prompted to configure. If you have already done so, and merely wish to update the &quot;Makefile&quot;, simply run:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    perl Makefile.PL JFDI=1<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This will keep your configuration intact. Note however, if there are changes to the default configuration file &quot;Config.pm-orig&quot;, you should either delete your current config file and reconfigure, or patch your config file from the new entries in &quot;Config.pm-orig&quot;.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RUNNING CPANPLUS FROM DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT</h1> If you'd rather not install the development version to your &quot;site_perl&quot; directory, that's no problem. You can set your &quot;PERL5LIB&quot; environment variable to CPANPLUS' &quot;lib&quot; directory, and you can run it from there.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RUNNING CPANPLUS TESTS</h1> Tests are what tells us if CPANPLUS is working. If a test is not working, try to run it explicitly like this:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    perl -I/path/to/cpanplus/lib t/XX_name_of_test.t 1<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The extra '1' makes sure that all the messages and errors (they might be errors we're testing for!) are being printed rather than kept quiet. This is a great way to find out the context of any failures that may occur.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you believe this test failure proves a bug in CPANPLUS, the long output of the test file is something we'd like to see alongside your bug report.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FINDING BUGS</h1> Sometimes you might find bugs in CPANPLUS' behaviour. If you encounter these in a development snapshot, we'd appreciate a complete patch (as described below in the &quot;SENDING PATCHES&quot; section.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If it's way over your head, then of course reporting the bug is always better than not reporting it at all. Before you do so though, make sure you have the  <b>latest</b> development snapshot, and the bug still persists there. If so, report the bug to this address:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    cpanplus-devel@lists.sourceforge.net<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
A good &quot;patch&quot; would have the following characteristics:<dl>
<dt>
Problem description</dt>
<dd>
Describe clearly what the bug is you found, and what it should have done instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Program demonstrating the bug</dt>
<dd>
Show us how to reproduce the bug, in a simple of a program as possible</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[OPTIONAL] A patch to the test suite to test for the bug</dt>
<dd>
Amend our test suite by making sure this bug will be found in this, and future versions of CPANPLUS (see &quot;SUPPLYING PATCHES&quot;)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[OPTIONAL] A patch to the code + tests + documentation</dt>
<dd>
Fix the bug, update the docs &amp; tests. That way your bug will be gone forever :)</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SUPPLYING PATCHES</h1> Patches are a good thing, and they are welcome. Especially if they fix bugs you've found along the way, or that others have reported.<div class="spacer">
</div>
We prefer patches in the following format:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
In &quot;diff -u&quot; or &quot;diff -c&quot; format</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
From the root of the snapshot</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Including patches for code + tests + docs</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Sent per mail to cpanplus-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
With subject containing &quot;[PATCH]&quot; + description of the patch</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
You will always be informed if a patch is applied or rejected, and in case of rejection why that is (perhaps you can tweak the patch to have it accepted after all).</div>
