When you receive these events, their structure members are set as follows.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a  <i>GraphicsExpose</i> event to a client application, it sends an  <i>XGraphicsExposeEvent</i> structure with the type member set to  <i>GraphicsExpose</i>. The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set to  <i>True</i> if the event came from a  <i>SendEvent</i> protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Both structures have these common members: drawable, major_code, and minor_code. The drawable member is set to the drawable of the destination region on which the graphics request was to be performed. The major_code member is set to the graphics request initiated by the client and can be either  <i>X_CopyArea</i> or  <i>X_CopyPlane</i>. If it is  <i>X_CopyArea</i>, a call to  <i>XCopyArea</i> initiated the request. If it is  <i>X_CopyPlane</i>, a call to  <i>XCopyPlane</i> initiated the request. These constants are defined in &lt; <i>X11/Xproto.h</i>&gt;. The minor_code member, like the major_code member, indicates which graphics request was initiated by the client. However, the minor_code member is not defined by the core X protocol and will be zero in these cases, although it may be used by an extension.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>XGraphicsExposeEvent</i> structure has these additional members: x, y, width, height, and count. The x and y members are set to the coordinates relative to the drawable's origin and indicate the upper-left corner of the rectangle. The width and height members are set to the size (extent) of the rectangle. The count member is set to the number of  <i>GraphicsExpose</i> events to follow. If count is zero, no more  <i>GraphicsExpose</i> events follow for this window. However, if count is nonzero, at least that number of  <i>GraphicsExpose</i> events (and possibly more) are to follow for this window.</div>
