<h1>NAME</h1> Moose::Manual::Classes - Making your classes use Moose (and subclassing)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>VERSION</h1> version 2.0401</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>USING MOOSE</h1> Using Moose is very simple, you just &quot;use Moose&quot;:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Person;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
That's it, you've made a class with Moose!<div class="spacer">
</div>
There's actually a lot going on here under the hood, so let's step through it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When you load Moose, a bunch of sugar functions are exported into your class, such as &quot;extends&quot;, &quot;has&quot;, &quot;with&quot;, and more. These functions are what you use to define your class. For example, you might define an attribute ...<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Person;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<br/>
  has 'ssn' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw' );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Attributes are described in the Moose::Manual::Attributes documentation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Loading Moose also enables the &quot;strict&quot; and &quot;warnings&quot; pragmas in your class.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When you load Moose, your class will become a subclass of Moose::Object. The Moose::Object class provides a default constructor and destructor, as well as object construction helper methods. You can read more about this in the Moose::Manual::Construction document.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a convenience, Moose creates a new class type for your class. See the Moose::Manual::Types document to learn more about types.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It also creates a Moose::Meta::Class object for your class. This metaclass object is now available by calling a &quot;meta&quot; method on your class, for example &quot;Person-&gt;meta&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The metaclass object provides an introspection API for your class. It is also used by Moose itself under the hood to add attributes, define parent classes, and so on. In fact, all of Moose's sugar does the real work by calling methods on this metaclass object (and other meta API objects).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SUBCLASSING</h1> Moose provides a simple sugar function for declaring your parent classes, &quot;extends&quot;:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package User;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<br/>
  extends 'Person';<br/>
<br/>
  has 'username' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw' );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that each call to &quot;extends&quot; will <i>reset</i> your parents. For multiple inheritance you must provide all the parents at once, &quot;extends 'Foo', 'Bar'&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can use Moose to extend a non-Moose parent. However, when you do this, you will inherit the parent class's constructor (assuming it is also called &quot;new&quot;). In that case, you will have to take care of initializing attributes manually, either in the parent's constructor, or in your subclass, and you will lose a lot of Moose magic.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See the MooseX::NonMoose module on CPAN if you're interested in extending non-Moose parent classes with Moose child classes.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CLEANING UP MOOSE DROPPINGS</h1> Moose exports a number of functions into your class. It's a good idea to remove these sugar functions from your class's namespace, so that &quot;Person-&gt;can('has')&quot; will no longer return true.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are several ways to do this. We recommend using namespace::autoclean, a CPAN module. Not only will it remove Moose exports, it will also remove any other exports.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Person;<br/>
<br/>
  use namespace::autoclean;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you absolutely can't use a CPAN module (but can use Moose?), you can write &quot;no Moose&quot; at the end of your class. This will remove any Moose exports in your class.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Person;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<br/>
  has 'ssn' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw' );<br/>
<br/>
  no Moose;<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>MAKING IT FASTER</h1> Moose has a feature called &quot;immutabilization&quot; that you can use to greatly speed up your classes at runtime. However, using it incurs a cost when your class is first being loaded. When you make your class immutable you tell Moose that you will not be changing it in the future. You will not be adding any more attributes, methods, roles, etc.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This allows Moose to generate code specific to your class. In particular, it creates an &quot;inline&quot; constructor, making object construction much faster.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To make your class immutable you simply call &quot;make_immutable&quot; on your class's metaclass object.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  __PACKAGE__-&gt;meta-&gt;make_immutable;<br/>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Immutabilization and &quot;new()&quot;</h2> If you override &quot;new()&quot; in your class, then the immutabilization code will not be able to provide an optimized constructor for your class. Instead, you should use a &quot;BUILD()&quot; method, which will be called from the inlined constructor.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Alternately, if you really need to provide a different &quot;new()&quot;, you can also provide your own immutabilization method. Doing so requires extending the Moose metaclasses, and is well beyond the scope of this manual.</div>
