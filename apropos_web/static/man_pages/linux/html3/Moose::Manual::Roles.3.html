<h1>NAME</h1> Moose::Manual::Roles - Roles, an alternative to deep hierarchies and base classes</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>VERSION</h1> version 2.0401</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>WHAT IS A ROLE?</h1> A role encapsulates some piece of behavior or state that can be shared between classes. It is something that classes  <i>do</i>. It is important to understand that  <i>roles are not classes</i>. You cannot inherit from a role, and a role cannot be instantiated. We sometimes say that roles are  <i>consumed</i>, either by classes or other roles.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Instead, a role is <i>composed</i> into a class. In practical terms, this means that all of the methods, method modifiers, and attributes defined in a role are added directly to (we sometimes say &quot;flattened into&quot;) the class that consumes the role. These attributes and methods then appear as if they were defined in the class itself. A subclass of the consuming class will inherit all of these methods and attributes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Moose roles are similar to mixins or interfaces in other languages.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Besides defining their own methods and attributes, roles can also require that the consuming class define certain methods of its own. You could have a role that consisted only of a list of required methods, in which case the role would be very much like a Java interface.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that attribute accessors also count as methods for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of a role.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>A SIMPLE ROLE</h1> Creating a role looks a lot like creating a Moose class:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Breakable;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose::Role;<br/>
<br/>
  has 'is_broken' =&gt; (<br/>
      is  =&gt; 'rw',<br/>
      isa =&gt; 'Bool',<br/>
  );<br/>
<br/>
  sub break {<br/>
      my $self = shift;<br/>
<br/>
      print &quot;I broke\n&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
      $self-&gt;is_broken(1);<br/>
  }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Except for our use of Moose::Role, this looks just like a class definition with Moose. However, this is not a class, and it cannot be instantiated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Instead, its attributes and methods will be composed into classes which use the role:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Car;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<br/>
  with 'Breakable';<br/>
<br/>
  has 'engine' =&gt; (<br/>
      is  =&gt; 'ro',<br/>
      isa =&gt; 'Engine',<br/>
  );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;with&quot; function composes roles into a class. Once that is done, the &quot;Car&quot; class has an &quot;is_broken&quot; attribute and a &quot;break&quot; method. The &quot;Car&quot; class also &quot;does('Breakable')&quot;:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  my $car = Car-&gt;new( engine =&gt; Engine-&gt;new );<br/>
<br/>
  print $car-&gt;is_broken ? 'Busted' : 'Still working';<br/>
  $car-&gt;break;<br/>
  print $car-&gt;is_broken ? 'Busted' : 'Still working';<br/>
<br/>
  $car-&gt;does('Breakable'); # true<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This prints:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  Still working<br/>
  I broke<br/>
  Busted<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
We could use this same role in a &quot;Bone&quot; class:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Bone;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<br/>
  with 'Breakable';<br/>
<br/>
  has 'marrow' =&gt; (<br/>
      is  =&gt; 'ro',<br/>
      isa =&gt; 'Marrow',<br/>
  );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
See also Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe1 for an example.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>REQUIRED METHODS</h1> As mentioned previously, a role can require that consuming classes provide one or more methods. Using our &quot;Breakable&quot; example, let's make it require that consuming classes implement their own &quot;break&quot; methods:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Breakable;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose::Role;<br/>
<br/>
  requires 'break';<br/>
<br/>
  has 'is_broken' =&gt; (<br/>
      is  =&gt; 'rw',<br/>
      isa =&gt; 'Bool',<br/>
  );<br/>
<br/>
  after 'break' =&gt; sub {<br/>
      my $self = shift;<br/>
<br/>
      $self-&gt;is_broken(1);<br/>
  };<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If we try to consume this role in a class that does not have a &quot;break&quot; method, we will get an exception.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can see that we added a method modifier on &quot;break&quot;. We want classes that consume this role to implement their own logic for breaking, but we make sure that the &quot;is_broken&quot; attribute is always set to true when &quot;break&quot; is called.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Car<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<br/>
  with 'Breakable';<br/>
<br/>
  has 'engine' =&gt; (<br/>
      is  =&gt; 'ro',<br/>
      isa =&gt; 'Engine',<br/>
  );<br/>
<br/>
  sub break {<br/>
      my $self = shift;<br/>
<br/>
      if ( $self-&gt;is_moving ) {<br/>
          $self-&gt;stop;<br/>
      }<br/>
  }<br/>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Roles Versus Abstract Base Classes</h2> If you are familiar with the concept of abstract base classes in other languages, you may be tempted to use roles in the same way.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You <i>can</i> define an &quot;interface-only&quot; role, one that contains <i>just</i> a list of required methods.<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, any class which consumes this role must implement all of the required methods, either directly or through inheritance from a parent. You cannot delay the method requirement check so that they can be implemented by future subclasses.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Because the role defines the required methods directly, adding a base class to the mix would not achieve anything. We recommend that you simply consume the interface role in each class which implements that interface.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Required Attributes</h2> As mentioned before, a role's required method may also be satisfied by an attribute accessor. However, the call to &quot;has&quot; which defines an attribute happens at runtime. This means that you must define the attribute  <i>before</i> consuming the role, or else the role will not see the generated accessor.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Breakable;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose::Role;<br/>
<br/>
  requires 'stress';<br/>
<br/>
  package Car;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<br/>
  has 'stress' =&gt; (<br/>
      is  =&gt; 'rw',<br/>
      isa =&gt; 'Int',<br/>
  );<br/>
<br/>
  with 'Breakable';<br/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>USING METHOD MODIFIERS</h1> Method modifiers and roles are a very powerful combination.  Often, a role will combine method modifiers and required methods. We already saw one example with our &quot;Breakable&quot; example.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Method modifiers increase the complexity of roles, because they make the role application order relevant. If a class uses multiple roles, each of which modify the same method, those modifiers will be applied in the same order as the roles are used:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package MovieCar;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<br/>
  extends 'Car';<br/>
<br/>
  with 'Breakable', 'ExplodesOnBreakage';<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Assuming that the new &quot;ExplodesOnBreakage&quot; method <i>also</i> has an &quot;after&quot; modifier on &quot;break&quot;, the &quot;after&quot; modifiers will run one after the other. The modifier from &quot;Breakable&quot; will run first, then the one from &quot;ExplodesOnBreakage&quot;.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>METHOD CONFLICTS</h1> If a class composes multiple roles, and those roles have methods of the same name, we will have a conflict. In that case, the composing class is required to provide its  <i>own</i> method of the same name.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Breakdancer;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose::Role<br/>
<br/>
  sub break {<br/>
<br/>
  }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If we compose both &quot;Breakable&quot; and &quot;Breakdancer&quot; in a class, we must provide our own &quot;break&quot; method:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package FragileDancer;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<br/>
  with 'Breakable', 'Breakdancer';<br/>
<br/>
  sub break { ... }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
A role can be a collection of other roles:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Break::Bundle;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose::Role;<br/>
<br/>
  with ('Breakable', 'Breakdancer');<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>METHOD EXCLUSION AND ALIASING</h1> If we want our &quot;FragileDancer&quot; class to be able to call the methods from both its roles, we can alias the methods:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package FragileDancer;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose;<br/>
<br/>
  with 'Breakable'   =&gt; { -alias =&gt; { break =&gt; 'break_bone' } },<br/>
       'Breakdancer' =&gt; { -alias =&gt; { break =&gt; 'break_dance' } };<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, aliasing a method simply makes a <i>copy</i> of the method with the new name. We also need to exclude the original name:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  with 'Breakable' =&gt; {<br/>
      -alias    =&gt; { break =&gt; 'break_bone' },<br/>
      -excludes =&gt; 'break',<br/>
      },<br/>
      'Breakdancer' =&gt; {<br/>
      -alias    =&gt; { break =&gt; 'break_dance' },<br/>
      -excludes =&gt; 'break',<br/>
      };<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The excludes parameter prevents the &quot;break&quot; method from being composed into the &quot;FragileDancer&quot; class, so we don't have a conflict. This means that &quot;FragileDancer&quot; does not need to implement its own &quot;break&quot; method.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is useful, but it's worth noting that this breaks the contract implicit in consuming a role. Our &quot;FragileDancer&quot; class does both the &quot;Breakable&quot; and &quot;BreakDancer&quot;, but does not provide a &quot;break&quot; method. If some API expects an object that does one of those roles, it probably expects it to implement that method.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In some use cases we might alias and exclude methods from roles, but then provide a method of the same name in the class itself.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Also see Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe2 for an example.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ROLE EXCLUSION</h1> A role can say that it cannot be combined with some other role. This should be used with great caution, since it limits the re-usability of the role.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  package Breakable;<br/>
<br/>
  use Moose::Role;<br/>
<br/>
  excludes 'BreakDancer';<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ADDING A ROLE TO AN OBJECT INSTANCE</h1> You may want to add a role to an object instance, rather than to a class. For example, you may want to add debug tracing to one instance of an object while debugging a particular bug. Another use case might be to dynamically change objects based on a user's configuration, as a plugin system.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The best way to do this is to use the &quot;apply_all_roles()&quot; function from Moose::Util:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  use Moose::Util qw( apply_all_roles );<br/>
<br/>
  my $car = Car-&gt;new;<br/>
  apply_all_roles( $car, 'Breakable' );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This function can apply more than one role at a time, and will do so using the normal Moose role combination system. We recommend using this function to apply roles to an object. This is what Moose uses internally when you call &quot;with&quot;.</div>
