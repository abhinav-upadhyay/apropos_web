<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The four functions <b>dlopen</b>(), <b>dlsym</b>(), <b>dlclose</b>(), <b>dlerror</b>() implement the interface to the dynamic linking loader.<div class="subsection">
<h2>dlerror()</h2> The function <b>dlerror</b>() returns a human readable string describing the most recent error that occurred from <b>dlopen</b>(), <b>dlsym</b>() or <b>dlclose</b>() since the last call to <b>dlerror</b>(). It returns NULL if no errors have occurred since initialization or since it was last called.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>dlopen()</h2> The function <b>dlopen</b>() loads the dynamic library file named by the null-terminated string <i>filename</i> and returns an opaque &quot;handle&quot; for the dynamic library. If <i>filename</i> is NULL, then the returned handle is for the main program. If <i>filename</i> contains a slash (&quot;/&quot;), then it is interpreted as a (relative or absolute) pathname. Otherwise, the dynamic linker searches for the library as follows (see <b>ld.so</b>(8) for further details):<dl>
<dt>
o</dt>
<dd>
(ELF only) If the executable file for the calling program contains a DT_RPATH tag, and does not contain a DT_RUNPATH tag, then the directories listed in the DT_RPATH tag are searched.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
o</dt>
<dd>
If, at the time that the program was started, the environment variable <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> was defined to contain a colon-separated list of directories, then these are searched. (As a security measure this variable is ignored for set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
o</dt>
<dd>
(ELF only) If the executable file for the calling program contains a DT_RUNPATH tag, then the directories listed in that tag are searched.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
o</dt>
<dd>
The cache file <i>/etc/ld.so.cache</i> (maintained by <b>ldconfig</b>(8)) is checked to see whether it contains an entry for <i>filename</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
o</dt>
<dd>
The directories <i>/lib</i> and <i>/usr/lib</i> are searched (in that order).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the library has dependencies on other shared libraries, then these are also automatically loaded by the dynamic linker using the same rules. (This process may occur recursively, if those libraries in turn have dependencies, and so on.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
One of the following two values must be included in <i>flag</i>:<dl>
<dt>
<b>RTLD_LAZY</b></dt>
<dd>
Perform lazy binding. Only resolve symbols as the code that references them is executed. If the symbol is never referenced, then it is never resolved. (Lazy binding is only performed for function references; references to variables are always immediately bound when the library is loaded.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>RTLD_NOW</b></dt>
<dd>
If this value is specified, or the environment variable <b>LD_BIND_NOW</b> is set to a nonempty string, all undefined symbols in the library are resolved before <b>dlopen</b>() returns. If this cannot be done, an error is returned.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Zero or more of the following values may also be ORed in <i>flag</i>:<dl>
<dt>
<b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b></dt>
<dd>
The symbols defined by this library will be made available for symbol resolution of subsequently loaded libraries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>RTLD_LOCAL</b></dt>
<dd>
This is the converse of <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>, and the default if neither flag is specified. Symbols defined in this library are not made available to resolve references in subsequently loaded libraries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>RTLD_NODELETE</b> (since glibc 2.2)</dt>
<dd>
Do not unload the library during <b>dlclose</b>(). Consequently, the library's static variables are not reinitialized if the library is reloaded with <b>dlopen</b>() at a later time. This flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>RTLD_NOLOAD</b> (since glibc 2.2)</dt>
<dd>
Don't load the library. This can be used to test if the library is already resident (<b>dlopen</b>() returns NULL if it is not, or the library's handle if it is resident). This flag can also be used to promote the flags on a library that is already loaded. For example, a library that was previously loaded with <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> can be reopened with <b>RTLD_NOLOAD&#160;|&#160;RTLD_GLOBAL</b>. This flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>RTLD_DEEPBIND</b> (since glibc 2.3.4)</dt>
<dd>
Place the lookup scope of the symbols in this library ahead of the global scope. This means that a self-contained library will use its own symbols in preference to global symbols with the same name contained in libraries that have already been loaded. This flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>filename</i> is a NULL pointer, then the returned handle is for the main program. When given to <b>dlsym</b>(), this handle causes a search for a symbol in the main program, followed by all shared libraries loaded at program startup, and then all shared libraries loaded by <b>dlopen</b>() with the flag <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
External references in the library are resolved using the libraries in that library's dependency list and any other libraries previously opened with the <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> flag. If the executable was linked with the flag &quot;-rdynamic&quot; (or, synonymously, &quot;--export-dynamic&quot;), then the global symbols in the executable will also be used to resolve references in a dynamically loaded library.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the same library is loaded again with <b>dlopen</b>(), the same file handle is returned. The dl library maintains reference counts for library handles, so a dynamic library is not deallocated until <b>dlclose</b>() has been called on it as many times as <b>dlopen</b>() has succeeded on it. The <b>_init</b>() routine, if present, is only called once. But a subsequent call with <b>RTLD_NOW</b> may force symbol resolution for a library earlier loaded with <b>RTLD_LAZY</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <b>dlopen</b>() fails for any reason, it returns NULL.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>dlsym()</h2> The function <b>dlsym</b>() takes a &quot;handle&quot; of a dynamic library returned by <b>dlopen</b>() and the null-terminated symbol name, returning the address where that symbol is loaded into memory. If the symbol is not found, in the specified library or any of the libraries that were automatically loaded by <b>dlopen</b>() when that library was loaded, <b>dlsym</b>() returns NULL. (The search performed by <b>dlsym</b>() is breadth first through the dependency tree of these libraries.) Since the value of the symbol could actually be NULL (so that a NULL return from <b>dlsym</b>() need not indicate an error), the correct way to test for an error is to call <b>dlerror</b>() to clear any old error conditions, then call <b>dlsym</b>(), and then call <b>dlerror</b>() again, saving its return value into a variable, and check whether this saved value is not NULL.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are two special pseudo-handles, <b>RTLD_DEFAULT</b> and <b>RTLD_NEXT</b>. The former will find the first occurrence of the desired symbol using the default library search order. The latter will find the next occurrence of a function in the search order after the current library. This allows one to provide a wrapper around a function in another shared library.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>dlclose()</h2> The function <b>dlclose</b>() decrements the reference count on the dynamic library handle <i>handle</i>. If the reference count drops to zero and no other loaded libraries use symbols in it, then the dynamic library is unloaded.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The function <b>dlclose</b>() returns 0 on success, and nonzero on error.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The obsolete symbols _init() and _fini()</h2> The linker recognizes special symbols <b>_init</b> and <b>_fini</b>. If a dynamic library exports a routine named <b>_init</b>(), then that code is executed after the loading, before <b>dlopen</b>() returns. If the dynamic library exports a routine named <b>_fini</b>(), then that routine is called just before the library is unloaded. In case you need to avoid linking against the system startup files, this can be done by using the <b>gcc</b>(1) <i>-nostartfiles</i> command-line option.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Using these routines, or the gcc <b>-nostartfiles</b> or <b>-nostdlib</b> options, is not recommended. Their use may result in undesired behavior, since the constructor/destructor routines will not be executed (unless special measures are taken).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Instead, libraries should export routines using the <b>__attribute__((constructor))</b> and <b>__attribute__((destructor))</b> function attributes. See the gcc info pages for information on these. Constructor routines are executed before <b>dlopen</b>() returns, and destructor routines are executed before <b>dlclose</b>() returns.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Glibc extensions: dladdr() and dlvsym()</h2> Glibc adds two functions not described by POSIX, with prototypes<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<b>#define _GNU_SOURCE</b>         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */ <b>#include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<b>int dladdr(void *</b><i>addr</i><b>, Dl_info *</b><i>info</i><b>);</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<b>void *dlvsym(void *</b><i>handle</i><b>, char *</b><i>symbol</i><b>, char *</b><i>version</i><b>);</b><br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The function <b>dladdr</b>() takes a function pointer and tries to resolve name and file where it is located. Information is stored in the <i>Dl_info</i> structure:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<br/>
typedef struct {<br/>
    const char *dli_fname;  /* Pathname of shared object that<br/>
                               contains address */<br/>
    void       *dli_fbase;  /* Address at which shared object<br/>
                               is loaded */<br/>
    const char *dli_sname;  /* Name of nearest symbol with address<br/>
                               lower than <i>addr</i> */<br/>
    void       *dli_saddr;  /* Exact address of symbol named<br/>
                               in <i>dli_sname</i> */<br/>
} Dl_info;<br/>
<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If no symbol matching <i>addr</i> could be found, then <i>dli_sname</i> and <i>dli_saddr</i> are set to NULL.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>dladdr</b>() returns 0 on error, and nonzero on success.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The function <b>dlvsym</b>(), provided by glibc since version 2.1, does the same as <b>dlsym</b>() but takes a version string as an additional argument.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> POSIX.1-2001 describes <b>dlclose</b>(), <b>dlerror</b>(), <b>dlopen</b>(), and <b>dlsym</b>().</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> The symbols <b>RTLD_DEFAULT</b> and <b>RTLD_NEXT</b> are defined by <i>&lt;dlfcn.h&gt;</i> only when <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b> was defined before including it.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Since glibc 2.2.3, <b>atexit</b>(3) can be used to register an exit handler that is automatically called when a library is unloaded.<div class="subsection">
<h2>History</h2> The dlopen interface standard comes from SunOS. That system also has <b>dladdr</b>(), but not <b>dlvsym</b>().</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS</h1> Sometimes, the function pointers you pass to <b>dladdr</b>() may surprise you. On some architectures (notably i386 and x86_64), <i>dli_fname</i> and <i>dli_fbase</i> may end up pointing back at the object from which you called <b>dladdr</b>(), even if the function used as an argument should come from a dynamically linked library.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The problem is that the function pointer will still be resolved at compile time, but merely point to the <i>plt</i> (Procedure Linkage Table) section of the original object (which dispatches the call after asking the dynamic linker to resolve the symbol). To work around this, you can try to compile the code to be position-independent: then, the compiler cannot prepare the pointer at compile time anymore and today's <b>gcc</b>(1) will generate code that just loads the final symbol address from the <i>got</i> (Global Offset Table) at run time before passing it to <b>dladdr</b>().</div>
