<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> &quot;Tie::File&quot; represents a regular text file as a Perl array.  Each element in the array corresponds to a record in the file.  The first line of the file is element 0 of the array; the second line is element 1, and so on.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The file is <i>not</i> loaded into memory, so this will work even for gigantic files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Changes to the array are reflected in the file immediately.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Lazy people and beginners may now stop reading the manual.<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;recsep&quot;</h2> What is a 'record'?  By default, the meaning is the same as for the &quot;&lt;...&gt;&quot; operator: It's a string terminated by $/, which is probably &quot;\n&quot;.  (Minor exception: on DOS and Win32 systems, a 'record' is a string terminated by &quot;\r\n&quot;.)  You may change the definition of &quot;record&quot; by supplying the &quot;recsep&quot; option in the &quot;tie&quot; call:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, recsep =&gt; 'es';<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This says that records are delimited by the string &quot;es&quot;.  If the file contained the following data:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        Curse these pesky flies!\n<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
then the @array would appear to have four elements:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        &quot;Curse th&quot;<br/>
        &quot;e p&quot;<br/>
        &quot;ky fli&quot;<br/>
        &quot;!\n&quot;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
An undefined value is not permitted as a record separator.  Perl's special &quot;paragraph mode&quot; semantics (a la &quot;$/ = &quot;&quot;&quot;) are not emulated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Records read from the tied array do not have the record separator string on the end; this is to allow<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $array[17] .= &quot;extra&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
to work as expected.<div class="spacer">
</div>
(See &quot;autochomp&quot;, below.)  Records stored into the array will have the record separator string appended before they are written to the file, if they don't have one already.  For example, if the record separator string is &quot;\n&quot;, then the following two lines do exactly the same thing:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $array[17] = &quot;Cherry pie&quot;;<br/>
        $array[17] = &quot;Cherry pie\n&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The result is that the contents of line 17 of the file will be replaced with &quot;Cherry pie&quot;; a newline character will separate line 17 from line 18.  This means that this code will do nothing:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        chomp $array[17];<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Because the &quot;chomp&quot;ed value will have the separator reattached when it is written back to the file.  There is no way to create a file whose trailing record separator string is missing.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Inserting records that <i>contain</i> the record separator string is not supported by this module.  It will probably produce a reasonable result, but what this result will be may change in a future version. Use 'splice' to insert records or to replace one record with several.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;autochomp&quot;</h2> Normally, array elements have the record separator removed, so that if the file contains the text<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        Gold<br/>
        Frankincense<br/>
        Myrrh<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
the tied array will appear to contain &quot;(&quot;Gold&quot;, &quot;Frankincense&quot;, &quot;Myrrh&quot;)&quot;.  If you set &quot;autochomp&quot; to a false value, the record separator will not be removed.  If the file above was tied with<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        tie @gifts, &quot;Tie::File&quot;, $gifts, autochomp =&gt; 0;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
then the array @gifts would appear to contain &quot;(&quot;Gold\n&quot;, &quot;Frankincense\n&quot;, &quot;Myrrh\n&quot;)&quot;, or (on Win32 systems) &quot;(&quot;Gold\r\n&quot;, &quot;Frankincense\r\n&quot;, &quot;Myrrh\r\n&quot;)&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;mode&quot;</h2> Normally, the specified file will be opened for read and write access, and will be created if it does not exist.  (That is, the flags &quot;O_RDWR | O_CREAT&quot; are supplied in the &quot;open&quot; call.)  If you want to change this, you may supply alternative flags in the &quot;mode&quot; option. See Fcntl for a listing of available flags. For example:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        # open the file if it exists, but fail if it does not exist<br/>
        use Fcntl 'O_RDWR';<br/>
        tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDWR;<br/>
<br/>
        # create the file if it does not exist<br/>
        use Fcntl 'O_RDWR', 'O_CREAT';<br/>
        tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDWR | O_CREAT;<br/>
<br/>
        # open an existing file in read-only mode<br/>
        use Fcntl 'O_RDONLY';<br/>
        tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDONLY;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Opening the data file in write-only or append mode is not supported.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;memory&quot;</h2> This is an upper limit on the amount of memory that &quot;Tie::File&quot; will consume at any time while managing the file.  This is used for two things: managing the  <i>read cache</i> and managing the <i>deferred write</i>  <i>buffer</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Records read in from the file are cached, to avoid having to re-read them repeatedly.  If you read the same record twice, the first time it will be stored in memory, and the second time it will be fetched from the  <i>read cache</i>.  The amount of data in the read cache will not exceed the value you specified for &quot;memory&quot;.  If &quot;Tie::File&quot; wants to cache a new record, but the read cache is full, it will make room by expiring the least-recently visited records from the read cache.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The default memory limit is 2Mib.  You can adjust the maximum read cache size by supplying the &quot;memory&quot; option.  The argument is the desired cache size, in bytes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        # I have a lot of memory, so use a large cache to speed up access<br/>
        tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, memory =&gt; 20_000_000;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Setting the memory limit to 0 will inhibit caching; records will be fetched from disk every time you examine them.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;memory&quot; value is not an absolute or exact limit on the memory used.  &quot;Tie::File&quot; objects contains some structures besides the read cache and the deferred write buffer, whose sizes are not charged against &quot;memory&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The cache itself consumes about 310 bytes per cached record, so if your file has many short records, you may want to decrease the cache memory limit, or else the cache overhead may exceed the size of the cached data.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;dw_size&quot;</h2> (This is an advanced feature.  Skip this section on first reading.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you use deferred writing (See &quot;Deferred Writing&quot;, below) then data you write into the array will not be written directly to the file; instead, it will be saved in the  <i>deferred write buffer</i> to be written out later.  Data in the deferred write buffer is also charged against the memory limit you set with the &quot;memory&quot; option.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You may set the &quot;dw_size&quot; option to limit the amount of data that can be saved in the deferred write buffer.  This limit may not exceed the total memory limit.  For example, if you set &quot;dw_size&quot; to 1000 and &quot;memory&quot; to 2500, that means that no more than 1000 bytes of deferred writes will be saved up.  The space available for the read cache will vary, but it will always be at least 1500 bytes (if the deferred write buffer is full) and it could grow as large as 2500 bytes (if the deferred write buffer is empty.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you don't specify a &quot;dw_size&quot;, it defaults to the entire memory limit.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Option Format</h2> &quot;-mode&quot; is a synonym for &quot;mode&quot;.  &quot;-recsep&quot; is a synonym for &quot;recsep&quot;.  &quot;-memory&quot; is a synonym for &quot;memory&quot;.  You get the idea.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Public Methods</h1> The &quot;tie&quot; call returns an object, say $o.  You may call<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        $rec = $o-&gt;FETCH($n);<br/>
        $o-&gt;STORE($n, $rec);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
to fetch or store the record at line $n, respectively; similarly the other tied array methods.  (See perltie for details.)  You may also call the following methods on this object:<div class="subsection">
<h2>&quot;flock&quot;</h2><br/>
        $o-&gt;flock(MODE)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
will lock the tied file.  &quot;MODE&quot; has the same meaning as the second argument to the Perl built-in &quot;flock&quot; function; for example &quot;LOCK_SH&quot; or &quot;LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB&quot;.  (These constants are provided by the &quot;use Fcntl ':flock'&quot; declaration.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;MODE&quot; is optional; the default is &quot;LOCK_EX&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;Tie::File&quot; maintains an internal table of the byte offset of each record it has seen in the file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When you use &quot;flock&quot; to lock the file, &quot;Tie::File&quot; assumes that the read cache is no longer trustworthy, because another process might have modified the file since the last time it was read.  Therefore, a successful call to &quot;flock&quot; discards the contents of the read cache and the internal record offset table.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;Tie::File&quot; promises that the following sequence of operations will be safe:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        my $o = tie @array, &quot;Tie::File&quot;, $filename;<br/>
        $o-&gt;flock;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In particular, &quot;Tie::File&quot; will <i>not</i> read or write the file during the &quot;tie&quot; call.  (Exception: Using &quot;mode =&gt; O_TRUNC&quot; will, of course, erase the file during the &quot;tie&quot; call.  If you want to do this safely, then open the file without &quot;O_TRUNC&quot;, lock the file, and use &quot;@array = ()&quot;.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The best way to unlock a file is to discard the object and untie the array.  It is probably unsafe to unlock the file without also untying it, because if you do, changes may remain unwritten inside the object. That is why there is no shortcut for unlocking.  If you really want to unlock the file prematurely, you know what to do; if you don't know what to do, then don't do it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All the usual warnings about file locking apply here.  In particular, note that file locking in Perl is  <b>advisory</b>, which means that holding a lock will not prevent anyone else from reading, writing, or erasing the file; it only prevents them from getting another lock at the same time.  Locks are analogous to green traffic lights: If you have a green light, that does not prevent the idiot coming the other way from plowing into you sideways; it merely guarantees to you that the idiot does not also have a green light at the same time.</div>

        my $old_value = $o-&gt;autochomp(0);    # disable autochomp option<br/>
        my $old_value = $o-&gt;autochomp(1);    #  enable autochomp option<br/>

<h2>&quot;offset&quot;</h2><br/>
        $off = $o-&gt;offset($n);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This method returns the byte offset of the start of the $nth record in the file.  If there is no such record, it returns an undefined value.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Tying to an already-opened filehandle</h1> If $fh is a filehandle, such as is returned by &quot;IO::File&quot; or one of the other &quot;IO&quot; modules, you may use:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        tie @array, 'Tie::File', $fh, ...;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Similarly if you opened that handle &quot;FH&quot; with regular &quot;open&quot; or &quot;sysopen&quot;, you may use:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        tie @array, 'Tie::File', \*FH, ...;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Handles that were opened write-only won't work.  Handles that were opened read-only will work as long as you don't try to modify the array.  Handles must be attached to seekable sources of data---that means no pipes or sockets.  If &quot;Tie::File&quot; can detect that you supplied a non-seekable handle, the &quot;tie&quot; call will throw an exception.  (On Unix systems, it can detect this.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that Tie::File will only close any filehandles that it opened internally.  If you passed it a filehandle as above, you &quot;own&quot; the filehandle, and are responsible for closing it after you have untied the @array.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Deferred Writing</h1> (This is an advanced feature.  Skip this section on first reading.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Normally, modifying a &quot;Tie::File&quot; array writes to the underlying file immediately.  Every assignment like &quot;$a[3] = ...&quot; rewrites as much of the file as is necessary; typically, everything from line 3 through the end will need to be rewritten.  This is the simplest and most transparent behavior.  Performance even for large files is reasonably good.<div class="spacer">
</div>
However, under some circumstances, this behavior may be excessively slow.  For example, suppose you have a million-record file, and you want to do:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        for (@FILE) {<br/>
          $_ = &quot;&gt; $_&quot;;<br/>
        }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first time through the loop, you will rewrite the entire file, from line 0 through the end.  The second time through the loop, you will rewrite the entire file from line 1 through the end.  The third time through the loop, you will rewrite the entire file from line 2 to the end.  And so on.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the performance in such cases is unacceptable, you may defer the actual writing, and then have it done all at once.  The following loop will perform much better for large files:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        (tied @a)-&gt;defer;<br/>
        for (@a) {<br/>
          $_ = &quot;&gt; $_&quot;;<br/>
        }<br/>
        (tied @a)-&gt;flush;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If &quot;Tie::File&quot;'s memory limit is large enough, all the writing will done in memory.  Then, when you call &quot;-&gt;flush&quot;, the entire file will be rewritten in a single pass.<div class="spacer">
</div>
(Actually, the preceding discussion is something of a fib.  You don't need to enable deferred writing to get good performance for this common case, because &quot;Tie::File&quot; will do it for you automatically unless you specifically tell it not to.  See &quot;autodeferring&quot;, below.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Calling &quot;-&gt;flush&quot; returns the array to immediate-write mode.  If you wish to discard the deferred writes, you may call &quot;-&gt;discard&quot; instead of &quot;-&gt;flush&quot;.  Note that in some cases, some of the data will have been written already, and it will be too late for &quot;-&gt;discard&quot; to discard all the changes.  Support for &quot;-&gt;discard&quot; may be withdrawn in a future version of &quot;Tie::File&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Deferred writes are cached in memory up to the limit specified by the &quot;dw_size&quot; option (see above).  If the deferred-write buffer is full and you try to write still more deferred data, the buffer will be flushed.  All buffered data will be written immediately, the buffer will be emptied, and the now-empty space will be used for future deferred writes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the deferred-write buffer isn't yet full, but the total size of the buffer and the read cache would exceed the &quot;memory&quot; limit, the oldest records will be expired from the read cache until the total size is under the limit.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;push&quot;, &quot;pop&quot;, &quot;shift&quot;, &quot;unshift&quot;, and &quot;splice&quot; cannot be deferred.  When you perform one of these operations, any deferred data is written to the file and the operation is performed immediately. This may change in a future version.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you resize the array with deferred writing enabled, the file will be resized immediately, but deferred records will not be written. This has a surprising consequence: &quot;@a = (...)&quot; erases the file immediately, but the writing of the actual data is deferred.  This might be a bug.  If it is a bug, it will be fixed in a future version.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Autodeferring</h2> &quot;Tie::File&quot; tries to guess when deferred writing might be helpful, and to turn it on and off automatically.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        for (@a) {<br/>
          $_ = &quot;&gt; $_&quot;;<br/>
        }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In this example, only the first two assignments will be done immediately; after this, all the changes to the file will be deferred up to the user-specified memory limit.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You should usually be able to ignore this and just use the module without thinking about deferring.  However, special applications may require fine control over which writes are deferred, or may require that all writes be immediate.  To disable the autodeferment feature, use<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        (tied @o)-&gt;autodefer(0);<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
or<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
        tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, autodefer =&gt; 0;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Similarly, &quot;-&gt;autodefer(1)&quot; re-enables autodeferment, and &quot;-&gt;autodefer()&quot; recovers the current value of the autodefer setting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONCURRENT ACCESS TO FILES</h1> Caching and deferred writing are inappropriate if you want the same file to be accessed simultaneously from more than one process.  Other optimizations performed internally by this module are also incompatible with concurrent access.  A future version of this module will support a &quot;concurrent =&gt; 1&quot; option that enables safe concurrent access.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Previous versions of this documentation suggested using &quot;memory =&gt; 0&quot; for safe concurrent access.  This was mistaken.  Tie::File will not support safe concurrent access before version 0.98.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CAVEATS</h1> (That's Latin for 'warnings'.)<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Reasonable effort was made to make this module efficient.  Nevertheless, changing the size of a record in the middle of a large file will always be fairly slow, because everything after the new record must be moved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
The behavior of tied arrays is not precisely the same as for regular arrays.  For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        # This DOES print &quot;How unusual!&quot;<br/>
        undef $a[10];  print &quot;How unusual!\n&quot; if defined $a[10];<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;undef&quot;-ing a &quot;Tie::File&quot; array element just blanks out the corresponding record in the file.  When you read it back again, you'll get the empty string, so the supposedly-&quot;undef&quot;'ed value will be defined.  Similarly, if you have &quot;autochomp&quot; disabled, then<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
        # This DOES print &quot;How unusual!&quot; if 'autochomp' is disabled<br/>
        undef $a[10];<br/>
        print &quot;How unusual!\n&quot; if $a[10];<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Because when &quot;autochomp&quot; is disabled, $a[10] will read back as &quot;\n&quot; (or whatever the record separator string is.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There are other minor differences, particularly regarding &quot;exists&quot; and &quot;delete&quot;, but in general, the correspondence is extremely close.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
I have supposed that since this module is concerned with file I/O, almost all normal use of it will be heavily I/O bound.  This means that the time to maintain complicated data structures inside the module will be dominated by the time to actually perform the I/O. When there was an opportunity to spend CPU time to avoid doing I/O, I usually tried to take it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
You might be tempted to think that deferred writing is like transactions, with &quot;flush&quot; as &quot;commit&quot; and &quot;discard&quot; as &quot;rollback&quot;, but it isn't, so don't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
There is a large memory overhead for each record offset and for each cache entry: about 310 bytes per cached data record, and about 21 bytes per offset table entry.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The per-record overhead will limit the maximum number of records you can access per file. Note that  <i>accessing</i> the length of the array via &quot;$x = scalar @tied_file&quot; accesses  <b>all</b> records and stores their offsets.  The same for &quot;foreach (@tied_file)&quot;, even if you exit the loop early.</dd>

<h1>THANKS</h1> Gigantic thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi, for agreeing to put this in the core when I hadn't written it yet, and for generally being helpful, supportive, and competent.  (Usually the rule is &quot;choose any one.&quot;) Also big thanks to Abhijit Menon-Sen for all of the same things.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Special thanks to Craig Berry and Peter Prymmer (for VMS portability help), Randy Kobes (for Win32 portability help), Clinton Pierce and Autrijus Tang (for heroic eleventh-hour Win32 testing above and beyond the call of duty), Michael G Schwern (for testing advice), and the rest of the CPAN testers (for testing generally).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Special thanks to Tels for suggesting several speed and memory optimizations.<div class="spacer">

Paragraph mode?<div class="spacer">

Fixed-length mode.  Leave-blanks mode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Maybe an autolocking mode?<div class="spacer">

For many common uses of the module, the read cache is a liability. For example, a program that inserts a single record, or that scans the file once, will have a cache hit rate of zero.  This suggests a major optimization: The cache should be initially disabled.  Here's a hybrid approach: Initially, the cache is disabled, but the cache code maintains statistics about how high the hit rate would be *if* it were enabled.  When it sees the hit rate get high enough, it enables itself.  The STAT comments in this code are the beginning of an implementation of this.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Record locking with <i>fcntl()</i>?  Then the module might support an undo log and get real transactions.  What a tour de force that would be.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Keeping track of the highest cached record. This would allow reads-in-a-row to skip the cache lookup faster (if reading from 1..N with empty cache at start, the last cached value will be always N-1).<div class="spacer">
