<h1>NAME</h1> lib - manipulate @INC at compile time</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
    use lib LIST;<br/>
<br/>
    no lib LIST;<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This is a small simple module which simplifies the manipulation of @INC at compile time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is typically used to add extra directories to perl's search path so that later &quot;use&quot; or &quot;require&quot; statements will find modules which are not located on perl's default search path.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Adding directories to @INC</h2> The parameters to &quot;use lib&quot; are added to the start of the perl search path. Saying<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use lib LIST;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
is <i>almost</i> the same as saying<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    BEGIN { unshift(@INC, LIST) }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For each directory in LIST (called $dir here) the lib module also checks to see if a directory called $dir/$archname/auto exists. If so the $dir/$archname directory is assumed to be a corresponding architecture specific directory and is added to @INC in front of $dir. lib.pm also checks if directories called $dir/$version and $dir/$version/$archname exist and adds these directories to @INC.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The current value of $archname can be found with this command:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    perl -V:archname<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The corresponding command to get the current value of $version is:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    perl -V:version<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To avoid memory leaks, all trailing duplicate entries in @INC are removed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Deleting directories from @INC</h2> You should normally only add directories to @INC.  If you need to delete directories from @INC take care to only delete those which you added yourself or which you are certain are not needed by other modules in your script.  Other modules may have added directories which they need for correct operation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;no lib&quot; statement deletes all instances of each named directory from @INC.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For each directory in LIST (called $dir here) the lib module also checks to see if a directory called $dir/$archname/auto exists. If so the $dir/$archname directory is assumed to be a corresponding architecture specific directory and is also deleted from @INC.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Restoring original @INC</h2> When the lib module is first loaded it records the current value of @INC in an array @lib::ORIG_INC. To restore @INC to that value you can say<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    @INC = @lib::ORIG_INC;<br/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CAVEATS</h1> In order to keep lib.pm small and simple, it only works with Unix filepaths.  This doesn't mean it only works on Unix, but non-Unix users must first translate their file paths to Unix conventions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    # VMS users wanting to put [.stuff.moo] into <br/>
    # their @INC would write<br/>
    use lib 'stuff/moo';<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> In the future, this module will likely use File::Spec for determining paths, as it does now for Mac OS (where Unix-style or Mac-style paths work, and Unix-style paths are converted properly to Mac-style paths before being added to @INC).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you try to add a file to @INC as follows:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  use lib 'this_is_a_file.txt';<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;lib&quot; will warn about this. The sole exceptions are files with the &quot;.par&quot; extension which are intended to be used as libraries.</div>
