<h1>3.10</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>Changed XXX_code2code behavior slightly</b></dt>
<dd>
In previous versions, passing in the same code set for both code set arguments would automatically return undef. For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   country_code2code('bo',LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);<br/>
      =&gt; undef<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This doesn't seem like reasonable behavior, so it has been changed to allow the same code set:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   country_code2code('bo',LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);<br/>
      =&gt; 'bo'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that if an invalid code is passed in, undef will still be returned:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   country_code2code('bol',LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);<br/>
      =&gt; undef<br/>

<dt>
<b>Added many semi-private routines</b></dt>
<dd>
Previous versions had only two semi-private routines: rename_country and alias_code which had the ability to modify the internal data in a couple very limited ways. It was requested (in an anonymous posting by someone named Steve and also by Steve Hay) that better support for modifying internal data, so a full set of routines were added.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The full set of routines includes:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h1>3.00</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>New maintainer</b></dt>
<dd>
From 1997 to 2004, Locale::Codes was maintained by Neil Bowers. Unfortunately, no updates were made from June 2004 to January 2010. During that time, a number of changes have been made to the standards since then, so the data included was out-of-date.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
I contacted Neil to get his permission to assume maintenance of the module, and he kindly agreed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>All codes are generated from standards</b></dt>
<dd>
All of the values returned by the various functions are now values directly from the standards. This means that the values returned in the 2.xx series are not necessarily the same as the values returned here.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As an example, the ISO 3166 standard which lists country codes refers to the country associated with the code &quot;bo&quot; as &quot;Bolivia, Plurinational State of&quot;, so that is what is returned. In the 2.xx series, &quot;Bolivia&quot; was returned.  Also, the country names vary from one standard to another. So the code &quot;bol&quot; which is maintained by the United Nations returns the name of the country as &quot;Bolivia (Plurinational State of)&quot;. Some common aliases have been added, so you can still request a code associated with a county name &quot;Bolivia&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Since the data comes from the standards, some &quot;incorrect&quot; values are no longer supported. For example, 2.07 treated &quot;Zaire&quot; as an alias for &quot;Congo&quot;, but the country changed it's name, and &quot;Zaire&quot; is not in the standard, so it has been dropped in 3.00.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Added several code sets from standards</b></dt>
<dd>
I've added the following code sets:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   FIPS 10 country codes<br/>
   Alpha-3 and Term language codes<br/>
   Numeric currency codes<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Locale::Script changed</b></dt>
<dd>
In 2.xx, Locale::Script assigned scripts to country codes, which is NOT how it is done currently in the standards. It appears that an older version of ISO 15924 did this, but I haven't found an old version to confirm that, and in any case, that is not the case in the current standards.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
As a result, the Locale::Script module is completely incompatible with the 2.xx version with respect to the types of codes it supports. None of the old codes will work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Added missing functions</b></dt>
<dd>
I've added in some functions which were &quot;missing&quot; previously (since there was only one set of codes supported, the code2code functions didn't apply):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   language_code2code<br/>
   currency_code2code<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
so the interfaces for each type of codes are consistent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Dropped support for _alias_code</b></dt>
<dd>
In Locale::Country, _alias_code was an allowed, but deprecated function which was documented to be supported in the 2.xx series. I've removed it.</dd>
