<h1>NAME</h1> File::HomeDir::Test - Prevent the accidental creation of user-owned files during testing</div>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <b>File::HomeDir::Test</b> is a File::HomeDir driver intended for use in the test scripts of modules or applications that write files into user-owned directories.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is designed to prevent the pollution of user directories with files that are not part of the application install itself, but were created during testing. These files can leak state information from the tests into the run-time usage of an application, and on Unix systems also prevents tests (which may be executed as root via sudo) from writing files which cannot later be modified or removed by the regular user.</div>
