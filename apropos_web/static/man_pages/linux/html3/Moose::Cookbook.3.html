<h1>NAME</h1> Moose::Cookbook - How to cook a Moose</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>VERSION</h1> version 2.0401</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The Moose cookbook is a series of recipes showing various Moose features. Most recipes present some code demonstrating some feature, and then explain the details of the code.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You should probably read the Moose::Manual first. The manual explains Moose concepts without being too code-heavy.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RECIPES</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Basic Moose</h2> These recipes will give you a good overview of Moose's capabilities, starting with simple attribute declaration, and moving on to more powerful features like laziness, types, type coercion, method modifiers, and more.<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe1 - The (always classic) <b>Point</b> example</dt>
<dd>
A simple Moose-based class. Demonstrates Moose attributes and subclassing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe2 - A simple <b>BankAccount</b> example</dt>
<dd>
A slightly more complex Moose class. Demonstrates using a method modifier in a subclass.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe3 - A lazy <b>BinaryTree</b> example</dt>
<dd>
Demonstrates several attribute features, including types, weak references, predicates (&quot;does this object have a foo?&quot;), defaults, laziness, and triggers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe4 - Subtypes, and modeling a simple <b>Company</b> class hierarchy</dt>
<dd>
Introduces the creation and use of custom types, a &quot;BUILD&quot; method, and the use of &quot;override&quot; in a subclass.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe5 - More subtypes, coercion in a <b>Request</b> class</dt>
<dd>
More type examples, including the use of type coercions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe6 - The augment/inner example</dt>
<dd>
Demonstrates the use of &quot;augment&quot; method modifiers, a way of turning the usual method overriding style &quot;inside-out&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe7 - Making Moose fast with immutable</dt>
<dd>
Making a class immutable greatly increases the speed of accessors and object construction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe8 - Builder methods and lazy_build</dt>
<dd>
The builder feature provides an inheritable and role-composable way to provide a default attribute value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe9 - Operator overloading, subtypes, and coercion</dt>
<dd>
Demonstrates using operator overloading, coercion, and subtypes to model how eye color is determined during reproduction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe10 - Using BUILDARGS and BUILD to hook into object construction</dt>
<dd>
This recipe demonstrates the use of &quot;BUILDARGS&quot; and &quot;BUILD&quot; to hook into object construction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe11 - Extending a non-Moose base class</dt>
<dd>
In this recipe, we make a Moose-based subclass of DateTime, a module which does not use Moose itself.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Moose Roles</h2> These recipes will show you how to use Moose roles.<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe1 - The Moose::Role example</dt>
<dd>
Demonstrates roles, which are also sometimes known as traits or mix-ins. Roles provide a method of code re-use which is orthogonal to subclassing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe2 - Advanced Role Composition - method exclusion and aliasing</dt>
<dd>
Sometimes you just want to include part of a role in your class. Sometimes you want the whole role but one of its methods conflicts with one in your class. With method exclusion and aliasing, you can work around these problems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe3 - Applying a role to an object instance</dt>
<dd>
In this recipe, we apply a role to an existing object instance.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Meta Moose</h2> These recipes show you how to write your own meta classes, which lets you extend the object system provided by Moose.<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe1 - Welcome to the meta-world (Why Go Meta?)</dt>
<dd>
If you're wondering what all this &quot;meta&quot; stuff is, and why you should care about it, read this &quot;recipe&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe2 - A meta-attribute, attributes with labels</dt>
<dd>
One way to extend Moose is to provide your own attribute metaclasses. Attribute metaclasses let you extend attribute declarations (with &quot;has&quot;) and behavior to provide additional attribute functionality.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe3 - Labels implemented via attribute traits</dt>
<dd>
Extending Moose's attribute metaclass is a great way to add functionality. However, attributes can only have one metaclass. Applying roles to the attribute metaclass lets you provide composable attribute functionality.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe4 - Adding a &quot;table&quot; attribute to the metaclass</dt>
<dd>
If you want to store more information about your classes, you'll have to extend &quot;Moose::Meta::Class&quot;. Doing so is simple, but you'll probably also want to provide some sugar, so see Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe2 as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe5 - The &quot;table&quot; attribute implemented as a metaclass trait</dt>
<dd>
This recipe takes the class metaclass we saw in the previous recipe and reimplements it as a metaclass trait.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe6 - A method metaclass for marking methods public or private</dt>
<dd>
This recipe shows a custom method metaclass that implements making a method private.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe7 - Using a blessed array reference as an object instance</dt>
<dd>
This recipe shows an example of how you create your own meta-instance class. The meta-instance determines the internal structure of object instances and provide access to attribute slots.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe8 - Hooking into immutabilization (TODO)</dt>
<dd>
Moose has a feature known as &quot;immutabilization&quot;. By calling &quot;__PACKAGE__-&gt;meta()-&gt;make_immutable()&quot; after defining your class (attributes, roles, etc), you tell Moose to optimize things like object creation, attribute access, and so on.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you are creating your own metaclasses, you may need to hook into the immutabilization system. This cuts across a number of spots, including the metaclass class, meta method classes, and possibly the meta-instance class as well.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This recipe shows you how to write extensions which immutabilize properly.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Extending Moose</h2> These recipes cover some more ways to extend Moose, and will be useful if you plan to write your own &quot;MooseX&quot; module.<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe1 - Moose extension overview</dt>
<dd>
There are quite a few ways to extend Moose. This recipe provides an overview of each method, and provides recommendations for when each is appropriate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe2 - Providing a base object class role</dt>
<dd>
Many base object class extensions can be implemented as roles. This example shows how to provide a base object class debugging role that is applied to any class that uses a notional &quot;MooseX::Debugging&quot; module.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe3 - Providing an alternate base object class</dt>
<dd>
You may find that you want to provide an alternate base object class along with a meta extension, or maybe you just want to add some functionality to all your classes without typing &quot;extends 'MyApp::Base'&quot; over and over.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe4 - Acting like Moose.pm and providing sugar Moose-style</dt>
<dd>
This recipe shows how to provide a replacement for &quot;Moose.pm&quot;. You may want to do this as part of the API for a &quot;MooseX&quot; module, especially if you want to default to a new metaclass class or base object class.</dd>
