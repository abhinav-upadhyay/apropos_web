<h1>NAME</h1> TIFFWriteDirectory, TIFFRewriteDirectory, TIFFCheckpointDirectory - write the current directory in an open <small>TIFF</small> file</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>int TIFFWriteDirectory(TIFF *</b><i>tif</i><b>)</b><div style="height: 0.00em;">

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i> will write the contents of the current directory to the file and setup to create a new subfile in the same file. Applications only need to call <i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i> when writing multiple subfiles to a single <small>TIFF</small> file. <i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i> is automatically called by <i>TIFFClose</i> and <i>TIFFFlush</i> to write a modified directory if the file is open for writing.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>TIFFRewriteDirectory</i> function operates similarly to <i>TIFFWriteDirectory,</i> but can be called with directories previously read or written that already have an established location in the file.  It will rewrite the directory, but instead of place it at it's old location (as <i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i> would) it will place them at the end of the file, correcting the pointer from the preceding directory or file header to point to it's new location.  This is particularly important in cases where the size of the directory and pointed to data has grown, so it won't fit in the space available at the old location.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>TIFFCheckpointDirectory</i> writes the current state of the tiff directory into the file to make what is currently in the file readable.  Unlike <i>TIFFWriteDirectory,</i> <i>TIFFCheckpointDirectory</i> does not free up the directory data structures in memory, so they can be updated (as strips/tiles are written) and written again.  Reading such a partial file you will at worst get a tiff read error for the first strip/tile encountered that is incomplete, but you will at least get all the valid data in the file before that.  When the file is complete, just use <i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i> as usual to finish it off cleanly.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUES</h1> 1 is returned when the contents are successfully written to the file. Otherwise, 0 is returned if an error was encountered when writing the directory contents.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1> All error messages are directed to the <i>TIFFError</i>(3TIFF) routine.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Error post-encoding before directory write</b>. Before writing the contents of the current directory, any pending data are flushed. This message indicates that an error occurred while doing this.<div class="spacer">
