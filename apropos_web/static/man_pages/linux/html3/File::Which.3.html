<h1>NAME</h1> File::Which - Portable implementation of the `which' utility</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
  use File::Which;                  # exports which()<br/>
  use File::Which qw(which where);  # exports which() and where()<br/>
  <br/>
  my $exe_path = which('perldoc');<br/>
  <br/>
  my @paths = where('perl');<br/>
  - Or -<br/>
  my @paths = which('perl'); # an array forces search for all of them<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> &quot;File::Which&quot; was created to be able to get the paths to executable programs on systems under which the `which' program wasn't implemented in the shell.<div class="spacer">
</div>
&quot;File::Which&quot; searches the directories of the user's &quot;PATH&quot; (as returned by &quot;File::Spec-&gt;path()&quot;), looking for executable files having the name specified as a parameter to &quot;which()&quot;. Under Win32 systems, which do not have a notion of directly executable files, but uses special extensions such as &quot;.exe&quot; and &quot;.bat&quot; to identify them, &quot;File::Which&quot; takes extra steps to assure that you will find the correct file (so for example, you might be searching for &quot;perl&quot;, it'll try  <i>perl.exe</i>, <i>perl.bat</i>, etc.)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Steps Used on Win32, DOS, OS2 and VMS</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Windows NT</h2> Windows NT has a special environment variable called &quot;PATHEXT&quot;, which is used by the shell to look for executable files. Usually, it will contain a list in the form &quot;.EXE;.BAT;.COM;.JS;.VBS&quot; etc. If &quot;File::Which&quot; finds such an environment variable, it parses the list and uses it as the different extensions.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Windows 9x and other ancient Win/DOS/OS2</h2> This set of operating systems don't have the &quot;PATHEXT&quot; variable, and usually you will find executable files there with the extensions &quot;.exe&quot;, &quot;.bat&quot; and (less likely) &quot;.com&quot;. &quot;File::Which&quot; uses this hardcoded list if it's running under Win32 but does not find a &quot;PATHEXT&quot; variable.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>VMS</h2> Same case as Windows 9x: uses &quot;.exe&quot; and &quot;.com&quot; (in that order).</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Functions</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>which($short_exe_name)</h2> Exported by default.<div class="spacer">
</div>
$short_exe_name is the name used in the shell to call the program (for example, &quot;perl&quot;).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If it finds an executable with the name you specified, &quot;which()&quot; will return the absolute path leading to this executable (for example,  <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> or  <i>C:\Perl\Bin\perl.exe</i>).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If it does <i>not</i> find the executable, it returns &quot;undef&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If &quot;which()&quot; is called in list context, it will return <i>all</i> the matches.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>where($short_exe_name)</h2> Not exported by default.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Same as &quot;which($short_exe_name)&quot; in array context. Same as the `where' utility, will return an array containing all the path names matching $short_exe_name.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS AND CAVEATS</h1> Not tested on VMS or MacOS, although there is platform specific code for those. Anyone who haves a second would be very kind to send me a report of how it went.<div class="spacer">
</div>
File::Spec adds the current directory to the front of PATH if on Win32, VMS or MacOS. I have no knowledge of those so don't know if the current directory is searced first or not. Could someone please tell me?</div>

Originated in <i>modperl-2.0/lib/Apache/Build.pm</i>. Changed for use in DocSet (for the mod_perl site) and Win32-awareness by me, with slight modifications by Stas Bekman, then extracted to create &quot;File::Which&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Version 0.04 had some significant platform-related changes, taken from the Perl Power Tools `which' implementation by Abigail with enhancements from Peter Prymmer. See &lt;http://www.perl.com/language/ppt/src/which/index.html&gt; for more information.</div>
