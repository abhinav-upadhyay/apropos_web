<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
    use File::CheckTree;<br/>
<br/>
    $num_warnings = validate( q{<br/>
        /vmunix                 -e || die<br/>
        /boot                   -e || die<br/>
        /bin                    cd<br/>
            csh                 -ex<br/>
            csh                 !-ug<br/>
            sh                  -ex<br/>
            sh                  !-ug<br/>

    });<br/>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>validate()</i> routine takes a single multiline string consisting of directives, each containing a filename plus a file test to try on it. (The file test may also be a &quot;cd&quot;, causing subsequent relative filenames to be interpreted relative to that directory.)  After the file test you may put &quot;|| die&quot; to make it a fatal error if the file test fails. The default is &quot;|| warn&quot;.  The file test may optionally have a &quot;!' prepended to test for the opposite condition.  If you do a cd and then list some relative filenames, you may want to indent them slightly for readability. If you supply your own  <i>die()</i> or <i>warn()</i> message, you can use $file to interpolate the filename.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Filetests may be bunched:  &quot;-rwx&quot; tests for all of &quot;-r&quot;, &quot;-w&quot;, and &quot;-x&quot;. Only the first failed test of the bunch will produce a warning.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The routine returns the number of warnings issued.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>AUTHOR</h1> File::CheckTree was derived from lib/validate.pl which was written by Larry Wall. Revised by Paul Grassie &lt; <i>grassie@perl.com</i>&gt; in 2002.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>HISTORY</h1> File::CheckTree used to not display fatal error messages. It used to count only those warnings produced by a generic &quot;|| warn&quot; (and not those in which the user supplied the message).  In addition, the  <i>validate()</i> routine would leave the user program in whatever directory was last entered through the use of &quot;cd&quot; directives. These bugs were fixed during the development of perl 5.8. The first fixed version of File::CheckTree was 4.2.</div>
