<h1>NAME</h1> Net::NNTP - NNTP Client class</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
    use Net::NNTP;<br/>
<br/>
    $nntp = Net::NNTP-&gt;new(&quot;some.host.name&quot;);<br/>
    $nntp-&gt;quit;<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> &quot;Net::NNTP&quot; is a class implementing a simple NNTP client in Perl as described in RFC977. &quot;Net::NNTP&quot; inherits its communication methods from &quot;Net::Cmd&quot;</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONSTRUCTOR</h1><dl>
<dt>
new ( [ HOST ] [, OPTIONS ])</dt>
<dd>
This is the constructor for a new Net::NNTP object. &quot;HOST&quot; is the name of the remote host to which a NNTP connection is required. If not given then it may be passed as the &quot;Host&quot; option described below. If no host is passed then two environment variables are checked, first &quot;NNTPSERVER&quot; then &quot;NEWSHOST&quot;, then &quot;Net::Config&quot; is checked, and if a host is not found then &quot;news&quot; is used.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;OPTIONS&quot; are passed in a hash like fashion, using key and value pairs. Possible options are:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Host</b> - NNTP host to connect to. It may be a single scalar, as defined for the &quot;PeerAddr&quot; option in IO::Socket::INET, or a reference to an array with hosts to try in turn. The &quot;host&quot; method will return the value which was used to connect to the host.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Timeout</b> - Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the NNTP server, a value of zero will cause all IO operations to block. (default: 120)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Debug</b> - Enable the printing of debugging information to STDERR<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Reader</b> - If the remote server is INN then initially the connection will be to nnrpd, by default &quot;Net::NNTP&quot; will issue a &quot;MODE READER&quot; command so that the remote server becomes innd. If the &quot;Reader&quot; option is given with a value of zero, then this command will not be sent and the connection will be left talking to nnrpd.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>METHODS</h1> Unless otherwise stated all methods return either a  <i>true</i> or <i>false</i> value, with  <i>true</i> meaning that the operation was a success. When a method states that it returns a value, failure will be returned as  <i>undef</i> or an empty list.<dl>
<dt>
article ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [FH] )</dt>
<dd>
Retrieve the header, a blank line, then the body (text) of the specified article.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If &quot;FH&quot; is specified then it is expected to be a valid filehandle and the result will be printed to it, on success a true value will be returned. If &quot;FH&quot; is not specified then the return value, on success, will be a reference to an array containing the article requested, each entry in the array will contain one line of the article.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If no arguments are passed then the current article in the currently selected newsgroup is fetched.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;MSGNUM&quot; is a numeric id of an article in the current newsgroup, and will change the current article pointer.  &quot;MSGID&quot; is the message id of an article as shown in that article's header.  It is anticipated that the client will obtain the &quot;MSGID&quot; from a list provided by the &quot;newnews&quot; command, from references contained within another article, or from the message-id provided in the response to some other commands.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If there is an error then &quot;undef&quot; will be returned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
body ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [FH] )</dt>
<dd>
Like &quot;article&quot; but only fetches the body of the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
head ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [FH] )</dt>
<dd>
Like &quot;article&quot; but only fetches the headers for the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
articlefh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
bodyfh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
headfh ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )</dt>
<dd>
These are similar to <i>article()</i>, <i>body()</i> and <i>head()</i>, but rather than returning the requested data directly, they return a tied filehandle from which to read the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
nntpstat ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;nntpstat&quot; command is similar to the &quot;article&quot; command except that no text is returned.  When selecting by message number within a group, the &quot;nntpstat&quot; command serves to set the &quot;current article pointer&quot; without sending text.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Using the &quot;nntpstat&quot; command to select by message-id is valid but of questionable value, since a selection by message-id does  <b>not</b> alter the &quot;current article pointer&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Returns the message-id of the &quot;current article&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
group ( [ GROUP ] )</dt>
<dd>
Set and/or get the current group. If &quot;GROUP&quot; is not given then information is returned on the current group.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In a scalar context it returns the group name.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In an array context the return value is a list containing, the number of articles in the group, the number of the first article, the number of the last article and the group name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
ihave ( MSGID [, MESSAGE ])</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;ihave&quot; command informs the server that the client has an article whose id is &quot;MSGID&quot;.  If the server desires a copy of that article, and &quot;MESSAGE&quot; has been given the it will be sent.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Returns <i>true</i> if the server desires the article and &quot;MESSAGE&quot; was successfully sent,if specified.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If &quot;MESSAGE&quot; is not specified then the message must be sent using the &quot;datasend&quot; and &quot;dataend&quot; methods from Net::Cmd<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;MESSAGE&quot; can be either an array of lines or a reference to an array.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
last ()</dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
postok ()</dt>
<dd>
&quot;postok&quot; will return <i>true</i> if the servers initial response indicated that it will allow posting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
authinfo ( USER, PASS )</dt>
<dd>
Authenticates to the server (using AUTHINFO USER / AUTHINFO PASS) using the supplied username and password.  Please note that the password is sent in clear text to the server.  This command should not be used with valuable passwords unless the connection to the server is somehow protected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
list ()</dt>
<dd>
Obtain information about all the active newsgroups. The results is a reference to a hash where the key is a group name and each value is a reference to an array. The elements in this array are:- the last article number in the group, the first article number in the group and any information flags about the group.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
newgroups ( SINCE [, DISTRIBUTIONS ])</dt>
<dd>
&quot;SINCE&quot; is a time value and &quot;DISTRIBUTIONS&quot; is either a distribution pattern or a reference to a list of distribution patterns. The result is the same as &quot;list&quot;, but the groups return will be limited to those created after &quot;SINCE&quot; and, if specified, in one of the distribution areas in &quot;DISTRIBUTIONS&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
newnews ( SINCE [, GROUPS [, DISTRIBUTIONS ]])</dt>
<dd>
&quot;SINCE&quot; is a time value. &quot;GROUPS&quot; is either a group pattern or a reference to a list of group patterns. &quot;DISTRIBUTIONS&quot; is either a distribution pattern or a reference to a list of distribution patterns.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

&#160;</div>
Returns the message-id of the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
post ( [ MESSAGE ] )</dt>
<dd>
Post a new article to the news server. If &quot;MESSAGE&quot; is specified and posting is allowed then the message will be sent.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If &quot;MESSAGE&quot; is not specified then the message must be sent using the &quot;datasend&quot; and &quot;dataend&quot; methods from Net::Cmd<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;MESSAGE&quot; can be either an array of lines or a reference to an array.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The message, either sent via &quot;datasend&quot; or as the &quot;MESSAGE&quot; parameter, must be in the format as described by RFC822 and must contain From:, Newsgroups: and Subject: headers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
postfh ()</dt>

If posting is allowed, this method will return a tied filehandle that you can  <i>print()</i> the contents of the article to be posted.  You must explicitly  <i>close()</i> the filehandle when you are finished posting the article, and the return value from the  <i>close()</i> call will indicate whether the message was successfully posted.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
active ( [ PATTERN ] )</dt>
<dd>
Similar to &quot;list&quot; but only active groups that match the pattern are returned. &quot;PATTERN&quot; can be a group pattern.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
xgtitle ( PATTERN )</dt>
<dd>
Returns a reference to a hash where the keys are all the group names which match &quot;PATTERN&quot; and each value is the description text for the group.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
xover ( MESSAGE-SPEC )</dt>
<dd>
The return value will be a reference to a hash where the keys are the message numbers and each value contains a reference to an array which contains the overview fields for that message.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The names of the fields can be obtained by calling &quot;overview_fmt&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
xpath ( MESSAGE-ID )</dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
reader</dt>
<dd>
Tell the server that you are a reader and not another server.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is required by some servers. For example if you are connecting to an INN server and you have transfer permission your connection will be connected to the transfer daemon, not the NNTP daemon. Issuing this command will cause the transfer daemon to hand over control to the NNTP daemon.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Some servers do not understand this command, but issuing it and ignoring the response is harmless.</dd>

<h1>DEFINITIONS</h1><dl>
<dt>
MESSAGE-SPEC</dt>
<dd>
&quot;MESSAGE-SPEC&quot; is either a single message-id, a single message number, or a reference to a list of two message numbers.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If &quot;MESSAGE-SPEC&quot; is a reference to a list of two message numbers and the second number in a range is less than or equal to the first then the range represents all messages in the group after the first message number.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>NOTE</b> For compatibility reasons only with earlier versions of Net::NNTP a message spec can be passed as a list of two numbers, this is deprecated and a reference to the list should now be passed</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
PATTERN</dt>
<dd>
The &quot;NNTP&quot; protocol uses the &quot;WILDMAT&quot; format for patterns. The WILDMAT format was first developed by Rich Salz based on the format used in the UNIX &quot;find&quot; command to articulate file names. It was developed to provide a uniform mechanism for matching patterns in the same manner that the UNIX shell matches filenames.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Patterns are implicitly anchored at the beginning and end of each string when testing for a match.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
There are five pattern matching operations other than a strict one-to-one match between the pattern and the source to be checked for a match.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The first is an asterisk &quot;*&quot; to match any sequence of zero or more characters.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The second is a question mark &quot;?&quot; to match any single character. The third specifies a specific set of characters.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The set is specified as a list of characters, or as a range of characters where the beginning and end of the range are separated by a minus (or dash) character, or as any combination of lists and ranges. The dash can also be included in the set as a character it if is the beginning or end of the set. This set is enclosed in square brackets. The close square bracket &quot;]&quot; may be used in a set if it is the first character in the set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The fourth operation is the same as the logical not of the third operation and is specified the same way as the third with the addition of a caret character &quot;^&quot; at the beginning of the test string just inside the open square bracket.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The final operation uses the backslash character to invalidate the special meaning of an open square bracket &quot;[&quot;, the asterisk, backslash or the question mark. Two backslashes in sequence will result in the evaluation of the backslash as a character with no special meaning.</dd>
