<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The legacy function <b>ttyslot</b>() returns the index of the current user's entry in some file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Now &quot;What file?&quot; you ask. Well, let's first look at some history.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Ancient History</h2> There used to be a file <i>/etc/ttys</i> in UNIX V6, that was read by the <b>init</b>(8) program to find out what to do with each terminal line. Each line consisted of three characters. The first character was either '0' or '1', where '0' meant &quot;ignore&quot;. The second character denoted the terminal: '8' stood for &quot;/dev/tty8&quot;. The third character was an argument to <b>getty</b>(8) indicating the sequence of line speeds to try ('-' was: start trying 110 baud). Thus a typical line was &quot;18-&quot;. A hang on some line was solved by changing the '1' to a '0', signaling init, changing back again, and signaling init again.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In UNIX V7 the format was changed: here the second character was the argument to <b>getty</b>(8) indicating the sequence of line speeds to try ('0' was: cycle through 300-1200-150-110 baud; '4' was for the on-line console DECwriter) while the rest of the line contained the name of the tty. Thus a typical line was &quot;14console&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Later systems have more elaborate syntax. System V-like systems have <i>/etc/inittab</i> instead.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Ancient History (2)</h2> On the other hand, there is the file <i>/etc/utmp</i> listing the people currently logged in. It is maintained by <b>login</b>(1). It has a fixed size, and the appropriate index in the file was determined by <b>login</b>(1) using the <b>ttyslot</b>() call to find the number of the line in <i>/etc/ttys</i> (counting from 1).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The semantics of ttyslot</h2> Thus, the function <b>ttyslot</b>() returns the index of the controlling terminal of the calling process in the file <i>/etc/ttys</i>, and that is (usually) the same as the index of the entry for the current user in the file <i>/etc/utmp</i>. BSD still has the <i>/etc/ttys</i> file, but System V-like systems do not, and hence cannot refer to it. Thus, on such systems the documentation says that <b>ttyslot</b>() returns the current user's index in the user accounting data base.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> If successful, this function returns the slot number. On error (e.g., if none of the file descriptors 0, 1 or 2 is associated with a terminal that occurs in this data base) it returns 0 on UNIX V6 and V7 and BSD-like systems, but -1 on System V-like systems.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> SUSv1; marked as LEGACY in SUSv2; removed in POSIX.1-2001. SUSv2 requires -1 on error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> The utmp file is found various places on various systems, such as <i>/etc/utmp</i>, <i>/var/adm/utmp</i>, <i>/var/run/utmp</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The glibc2 implementation of this function reads the file <b>_PATH_TTYS</b>, defined in <i>&lt;ttyent.h&gt;</i> as &quot;/etc/ttys&quot;. It returns 0 on error. Since Linux systems do not usually have &quot;/etc/ttys&quot;, it will always return 0.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Minix also has <i>fttyslot</i>(<i>fd</i>).</div>
