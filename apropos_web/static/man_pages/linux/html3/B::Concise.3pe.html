<h1>NAME</h1> B::Concise - Walk Perl syntax tree, printing concise info about ops</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
    perl -MO=Concise[,OPTIONS] foo.pl<br/>
<br/>
    use B::Concise qw(set_style add_callback);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This compiler backend prints the internal OPs of a Perl program's syntax tree in one of several space-efficient text formats suitable for debugging the inner workings of perl or other compiler backends. It can print OPs in the order they appear in the OP tree, in the order they will execute, or in a text approximation to their tree structure, and the format of the information displayed is customizable. Its function is similar to that of perl's  <b>-Dx</b> debugging flag or the <b>B::Terse</b> module, but it is more sophisticated and flexible.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLE</h1> Here's two outputs (or 'renderings'), using the -exec and -basic (i.e. default) formatting conventions on the same code snippet.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    % perl -MO=Concise,-exec -e '$a = $b + 42'<br/>
    1  &lt;0&gt; enter<br/>
    2  &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 1 -e:1) v<br/>
    3  &lt;#&gt; gvsv[*b] s<br/>
    4  &lt;$&gt; const[IV 42] s<br/>
 *  5  &lt;2&gt; add[t3] sK/2<br/>
    6  &lt;#&gt; gvsv[*a] s<br/>
    7  &lt;2&gt; sassign vKS/2<br/>
    8  &lt;@&gt; leave[1 ref] vKP/REFC<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In this -exec rendering, each opcode is executed in the order shown. The add opcode, marked with '*', is discussed in more detail.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The 1st column is the op's sequence number, starting at 1, and is displayed in base 36 by default.  Here they're purely linear; the sequences are very helpful when looking at code with loops and branches.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The symbol between angle brackets indicates the op's type, for example; &lt;2&gt; is a BINOP, &lt;@&gt; a LISTOP, and &lt;#&gt; is a PADOP, which is used in threaded perls. (see &quot;OP class abbreviations&quot;).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The opname, as in <b>'add[t1]'</b>, may be followed by op-specific information in parentheses or brackets (ex  <b>'[t1]'</b>).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The op-flags (ex <b>'sK/2'</b>) are described in (&quot;OP flags abbreviations&quot;).<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    % perl -MO=Concise -e '$a = $b + 42'<br/>
    8  &lt;@&gt; leave[1 ref] vKP/REFC -&gt;(end)<br/>
    1     &lt;0&gt; enter -&gt;2<br/>
    2     &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 1 -e:1) v -&gt;3<br/>
    7     &lt;2&gt; sassign vKS/2 -&gt;8<br/>
 *  5        &lt;2&gt; add[t1] sK/2 -&gt;6<br/>
    -           &lt;1&gt; ex-rv2sv sK/1 -&gt;4<br/>
    3              &lt;$&gt; gvsv(*b) s -&gt;4<br/>
    4           &lt;$&gt; const(IV 42) s -&gt;5<br/>
    -        &lt;1&gt; ex-rv2sv sKRM*/1 -&gt;7<br/>
    6           &lt;$&gt; gvsv(*a) s -&gt;7<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The default rendering is top-down, so they're not in execution order. This form reflects the way the stack is used to parse and evaluate expressions; the add operates on the two terms below it in the tree.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Nullops appear as &quot;ex-opname&quot;, where <i>opname</i> is an op that has been optimized away by perl.  They're displayed with a sequence-number of '-', because they are not executed (they don't appear in previous example), they're printed here because they reflect the parse.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The arrow points to the sequence number of the next op; they're not displayed in -exec mode, for obvious reasons.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that because this rendering was done on a non-threaded perl, the PADOPs in the previous examples are now SVOPs, and some (but not all) of the square brackets have been replaced by round ones.  This is a subtle feature to provide some visual distinction between renderings on threaded and un-threaded perls.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> Arguments that don't start with a hyphen are taken to be the names of subroutines to render; if no such functions are specified, the main body of the program (outside any subroutines, and not including use'd or require'd files) is rendered.  Passing &quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, &quot;CHECK&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot;, or &quot;END&quot; will cause all of the corresponding special blocks to be printed.  Arguments must follow options.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Options affect how things are rendered (ie printed).  They're presented here by their visual effect, 1st being strongest.  They're grouped according to how they interrelate; within each group the options are mutually exclusive (unless otherwise stated).<div class="subsection">
<h2>Options for Opcode Ordering</h2> These options control the 'vertical display' of opcodes.  The display 'order' is also called 'mode' elsewhere in this document.<dl>
<dt>
<b>-basic</b></dt>
<dd>
Print OPs in the order they appear in the OP tree (a preorder traversal, starting at the root). The indentation of each OP shows its level in the tree, and the '-&gt;' at the end of the line indicates the next opcode in execution order.  This mode is the default, so the flag is included simply for completeness.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-exec</b></dt>
<dd>
Print OPs in the order they would normally execute (for the majority of constructs this is a postorder traversal of the tree, ending at the root). In most cases the OP that usually follows a given OP will appear directly below it; alternate paths are shown by indentation. In cases like loops when control jumps out of a linear path, a 'goto' line is generated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-tree</b></dt>
<dd>
Print OPs in a text approximation of a tree, with the root of the tree at the left and 'left-to-right' order of children transformed into 'top-to-bottom'. Because this mode grows both to the right and down, it isn't suitable for large programs (unless you have a very wide terminal).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Options for Line-Style</h2> These options select the line-style (or just style) used to render each opcode, and dictates what info is actually printed into each line.<dl>
<dt>
<b>-concise</b></dt>
<dd>
Use the author's favorite set of formatting conventions. This is the default, of course.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-terse</b></dt>
<dd>
Use formatting conventions that emulate the output of <b>B::Terse</b>. The basic mode is almost indistinguishable from the real  <b>B::Terse</b>, and the exec mode looks very similar, but is in a more logical order and lacks curly brackets.  <b>B::Terse</b> doesn't have a tree mode, so the tree mode is only vaguely reminiscent of  <b>B::Terse</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-linenoise</b></dt>
<dd>
Use formatting conventions in which the name of each OP, rather than being written out in full, is represented by a one- or two-character abbreviation. This is mainly a joke.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-debug</b></dt>
<dd>
Use formatting conventions reminiscent of <b>B::Debug</b>; these aren't very concise at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-env</b></dt>
<dd>
Use formatting conventions read from the environment variables &quot;B_CONCISE_FORMAT&quot;, &quot;B_CONCISE_GOTO_FORMAT&quot;, and &quot;B_CONCISE_TREE_FORMAT&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Options for tree-specific formatting</h2><dl>
<dt>
<b>-compact</b></dt>
<dd>
Use a tree format in which the minimum amount of space is used for the lines connecting nodes (one character in most cases). This squeezes out a few precious columns of screen real estate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-loose</b></dt>
<dd>
Use a tree format that uses longer edges to separate OP nodes. This format tends to look better than the compact one, especially in ASCII, and is the default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-vt</b></dt>
<dd>
Use tree connecting characters drawn from the VT100 line-drawing set. This looks better if your terminal supports it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-ascii</b></dt>
<dd>
Draw the tree with standard ASCII characters like &quot;+&quot; and &quot;|&quot;. These don't look as clean as the VT100 characters, but they'll work with almost any terminal (or the horizontal scrolling mode of  <i>less</i>(1)) and are suitable for text documentation or email. This is the default.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
These are pairwise exclusive, i.e. compact or loose, vt or ascii.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Options controlling sequence numbering</h2><dl>
<dt>
<b>-base</b><i>n</i></dt>
<dd>
Print OP sequence numbers in base <i>n</i>. If <i>n</i> is greater than 10, the digit for 11 will be 'a', and so on. If  <i>n</i> is greater than 36, the digit for 37 will be 'A', and so on until 62. Values greater than 62 are not currently supported. The default is 36.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-bigendian</b></dt>
<dd>
Print sequence numbers with the most significant digit first. This is the usual convention for Arabic numerals, and the default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-littleendian</b></dt>
<dd>
Print seqence numbers with the least significant digit first.  This is obviously mutually exclusive with bigendian.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Other options</h2><dl>
<dt>
<b>-src</b></dt>
<dd>
With this option, the rendering of each statement (starting with the nextstate OP) will be preceded by the 1st line of source code that generates it.  For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    1  &lt;0&gt; enter<br/>
    # 1: my $i;<br/>
    2  &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 1 junk.pl:1) v:{<br/>
    3  &lt;0&gt; padsv[$i:1,10] vM/LVINTRO<br/>
    # 3: for $i (0..9) {<br/>
    4  &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 3 junk.pl:3) v:{<br/>
    5  &lt;0&gt; pushmark s<br/>
    6  &lt;$&gt; const[IV 0] s<br/>
    7  &lt;$&gt; const[IV 9] s<br/>
    8  &lt;{&gt; enteriter(next-&gt;j last-&gt;m redo-&gt;9)[$i:1,10] lKS<br/>
    k  &lt;0&gt; iter s<br/>
    l  &lt;|&gt; and(other-&gt;9) vK/1<br/>
    # 4:     print &quot;line &quot;;<br/>
    9      &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 2 junk.pl:4) v<br/>
    a      &lt;0&gt; pushmark s<br/>
    b      &lt;$&gt; const[PV &quot;line &quot;] s<br/>
    c      &lt;@&gt; print vK<br/>
    # 5:     print &quot;$i\n&quot;;<br/>
    ...<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-stash=&quot;somepackage&quot;</b></dt>
<dd>
With this, &quot;somepackage&quot; will be required, then the stash is inspected, and each function is rendered.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following options are pairwise exclusive.<dl>
<dt>
<b>-main</b></dt>
<dd>
Include the main program in the output, even if subroutines were also specified.  This rendering is normally suppressed when a subroutine name or reference is given.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-nomain</b></dt>
<dd>
This restores the default behavior after you've changed it with '-main' (it's not normally needed).  If no subroutine name/ref is given, main is rendered, regardless of this flag.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-nobanner</b></dt>
<dd>
Renderings usually include a banner line identifying the function name or stringified subref.  This suppresses the printing of the banner.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
TBC: Remove the stringified coderef; while it provides a 'cookie' for each function rendered, the cookies used should be 1,2,3.. not a random hex-address.  It also complicates string comparison of two different trees.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-banner</b></dt>
<dd>
restores default banner behavior.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-banneris</b> =&gt; subref</dt>
<dd>
TBC: a hookpoint (and an option to set it) for a user-supplied function to produce a banner appropriate for users needs.  It's not ideal, because the rendering-state variables, which are a natural candidate for use in concise.t, are unavailable to the user.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Option Stickiness</h2> If you invoke Concise more than once in a program, you should know that the options are 'sticky'.  This means that the options you provide in the first call will be remembered for the 2nd call, unless you re-specify or change them.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>ABBREVIATIONS</h1> The concise style uses symbols to convey maximum info with minimal clutter (like hex addresses).  With just a little practice, you can start to see the flowers, not just the branches, in the trees.<div class="subsection">

<h1>FORMATTING SPECIFICATIONS</h1> For each line-style ('concise', 'terse', 'linenoise', etc.) there are 3 format-specs which control how OPs are rendered.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first is the 'default' format, which is used in both basic and exec modes to print all opcodes.  The 2nd, goto-format, is used in exec mode when branches are encountered.  They're not real opcodes, and are inserted to look like a closing curly brace.  The tree-format is tree specific.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a line is rendered, the correct format-spec is copied and scanned for the following items; data is substituted in, and other manipulations like basic indenting are done, for each opcode rendered.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are 3 kinds of items that may be populated; special patterns, #vars, and literal text, which is copied verbatim.  (Yes, it's a set of s///g steps.)<div class="subsection">
<h2>Special Patterns</h2> These items are the primitives used to perform indenting, and to select text from amongst alternatives.<dl>
<dt>
<b>(x(</b><i>exec_text</i><b>;</b><i>basic_text</i><b>)x)</b></dt>
<dd>
Generates <i>exec_text</i> in exec mode, or <i>basic_text</i> in basic mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>(*(</b><i>text</i><b>)*)</b></dt>
<dd>
Generates one copy of <i>text</i> for each indentation level.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>(*(</b><i>text1</i><b>;</b><i>text2</i><b>)*)</b></dt>
<dd>
Generates one fewer copies of <i>text1</i> than the indentation level, followed by one copy of  <i>text2</i> if the indentation level is more than 0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>(?(</b><i>text1</i><b>#</b><i>var</i><i>Text2</i><b>)?)</b></dt>
<dd>
If the value of <i>var</i> is true (not empty or zero), generates the value of  <i>var</i> surrounded by <i>text1</i> and <i>Text2</i>, otherwise nothing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>~</b></dt>
<dd>
Any number of tildes and surrounding whitespace will be collapsed to a single space.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2># Variables</h2> These #vars represent opcode properties that you may want as part of your rendering.  The '#' is intended as a private sigil; a #var's value is interpolated into the style-line, much like &quot;read $this&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These vars take 3 forms:<dl>
<dt>
<b>#</b><i>var</i></dt>
<dd>
A property named 'var' is assumed to exist for the opcodes, and is interpolated into the rendering.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>#</b><i>var</i><i>N</i></dt>
<dd>
Generates the value of <i>var</i>, left justified to fill <i>N</i> spaces. Note that this means while you can have properties 'foo' and 'foo2', you cannot render 'foo2', but you could with 'foo2a'.  You would be wise not to rely on this behavior going forward ;-)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>#</b><i>Var</i></dt>
<dd>
This ucfirst form of #var generates a tag-value form of itself for display; it converts '#Var' into a 'Var =&gt; #var' style, which is then handled as described above.  (Imp-note: #Vars cannot be used for conditional-fills, because the =&gt; #var transform is done after the check for #Var's value).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following variables are 'defined' by B::Concise; when they are used in a style, their respective values are plugged into the rendering of each opcode.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Only some of these are used by the standard styles, the others are provided for you to delve into optree mechanics, should you wish to add a new style (see &quot;add_style&quot; below) that uses them.  You can also add new ones using &quot;add_callback&quot;.<dl>

<b>#addr</b></dt>
<dd>
The address of the OP, in hexadecimal.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>#arg</b></dt>

<h1>One-Liner Command tips</h1><dl>
<dt>
perl -MO=Concise,bar foo.pl</dt>
<dd>
Renders only <i>bar()</i> from foo.pl.  To see main, drop the ',bar'.  To see both, add ',-main'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
perl -MDigest::MD5=md5 -MO=Concise,md5 -e1</dt>
<dd>
Identifies md5 as an XS function.  The export is needed so that BC can find it in main.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
perl -MPOSIX -MO=Concise,_POSIX_ARG_MAX -e1</dt>
<dd>
Identifies _POSIX_ARG_MAX as a constant sub, optimized to an IV. Although POSIX isn't entirely consistent across platforms, this is likely to be present in virtually all of them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
perl -MPOSIX -MO=Concise,a -e 'print _POSIX_SAVED_IDS'</dt>
<dd>
This renders a print statement, which includes a call to the function. It's identical to rendering a file with a use call and that single statement, except for the filename which appears in the nextstate ops.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
perl -MPOSIX -MO=Concise,a -e 'sub a{_POSIX_SAVED_IDS}'</dt>
<dd>
This is <b>very</b> similar to previous, only the first two ops differ.  This subroutine rendering is more representative, insofar as a single main program will have many subs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
perl -MB::Concise -e 'B::Concise::compile(&quot;-exec&quot;,&quot;-src&quot;, \%B::Concise::)-&gt;()'</dt>
<dd>
This renders all functions in the B::Concise package with the source lines.  It eschews the O framework so that the stashref can be passed directly to  <i>B::Concise::compile()</i>.  See -stash option for a more convenient way to render a package.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Using B::Concise outside of the O framework</h1> The common (and original) usage of B::Concise was for command-line renderings of simple code, as given in EXAMPLE.  But you can also use  <b>B::Concise</b> from your code, and call <i>compile()</i> directly, and repeatedly.  By doing so, you can avoid the compile-time only operation of O.pm, and even use the debugger to step through  <i>B::Concise::compile()</i> itself.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Once you're doing this, you may alter Concise output by adding new rendering styles, and by optionally adding callback routines which populate new variables, if such were referenced from those (just added) styles.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Example: Altering Concise Renderings</h2><br/>
    use B::Concise qw(set_style add_callback);<br/>
    add_style($yourStyleName =&gt; $defaultfmt, $gotofmt, $treefmt);<br/>
    add_callback<br/>
      ( sub {<br/>
            my ($h, $op, $format, $level, $stylename) = @_;<br/>
            $h-&gt;{variable} = some_func($op);<br/>
        });<br/>
    $walker = B::Concise::compile(@options,@subnames,@subrefs);<br/>
    $walker-&gt;();<br/>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>set_style()</i></h2>  <b>set_style</b> accepts 3 arguments, and updates the three format-specs comprising a line-style (basic-exec, goto, tree).  It has one minor drawback though; it doesn't register the style under a new name.  This can become an issue if you render more than once and switch styles. Thus you may prefer to use  <i>add_style()</i> and/or <i>set_style_standard()</i> instead.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>set_style_standard($name)</h2> This restores one of the standard line-styles: &quot;terse&quot;, &quot;concise&quot;, &quot;linenoise&quot;, &quot;debug&quot;, &quot;env&quot;, into effect.  It also accepts style names previously defined with  <i>add_style()</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>add_style ()</h2> This subroutine accepts a new style name and three style arguments as above, and creates, registers, and selects the newly named style.  It is an error to re-add a style; call  <i>set_style_standard()</i> to switch between several styles.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>add_callback ()</h2> If your newly minted styles refer to any new #variables, you'll need to define a callback subroutine that will populate (or modify) those variables.  They are then available for use in the style you've chosen.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The callbacks are called for each opcode visited by Concise, in the same order as they are added.  Each subroutine is passed five parameters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  1. A hashref, containing the variable names and values which are<br/>
     populated into the report-line for the op<br/>
  2. the op, as a B&lt;B::OP&gt; object<br/>
  3. a reference to the format string<br/>
  4. the formatting (indent) level<br/>
  5. the selected stylename<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To define your own variables, simply add them to the hash, or change existing values if you need to.  The level and format are passed in as references to scalars, but it is unlikely that they will need to be changed or even used.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Running <i>B::Concise::compile()</i></h2>  <b>compile</b> accepts options as described above in &quot;OPTIONS&quot;, and arguments, which are either coderefs, or subroutine names.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It constructs and returns a $treewalker coderef, which when invoked, traverses, or walks, and renders the optrees of the given arguments to STDOUT.  You can reuse this, and can change the rendering style used each time; thereafter the coderef renders in the new style.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>walk_output</b> lets you change the print destination from STDOUT to another open filehandle, or into a string passed as a ref (unless you've built perl with -Uuseperlio).<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    my $walker = B::Concise::compile('-terse','aFuncName', \&amp;aSubRef);  # 1<br/>
    walk_output(\my $buf);<br/>
    $walker-&gt;();                        # 1 renders -terse<br/>
    set_style_standard('concise');      # 2<br/>
    $walker-&gt;();                        # 2 renders -concise<br/>
    $walker-&gt;(@new);                    # 3 renders whatever<br/>
    print &quot;3 different renderings: terse, concise, and @new: $buf\n&quot;;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When $walker is called, it traverses the subroutines supplied when it was created, and renders them using the current style.  You can change the style afterwards in several different ways:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  1. call C&lt;compile&gt;, altering style or mode/order<br/>
  2. call C&lt;set_style_standard&gt;<br/>
  3. call $walker, passing @new options<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Passing new options to the $walker is the easiest way to change amongst any pre-defined styles (the ones you add are automatically recognized as options), and is the only way to alter rendering order without calling compile again.  Note however that rendering state is still shared amongst multiple $walker objects, so they must still be used in a coordinated manner.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><i>B::Concise::reset_sequence()</i></h2> This function (not exported) lets you reset the sequence numbers (note that they're numbered arbitrarily, their goal being to be human readable).  Its purpose is mostly to support testing, i.e. to compare the concise output from two identical anonymous subroutines (but different instances).  Without the reset, B::Concise, seeing that they're separate optrees, generates different sequence numbers in the output.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Errors</h2> Errors in rendering (non-existent function-name, non-existent coderef) are written to the STDOUT, or wherever you've set it via  <i>walk_output()</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Errors using the various *style* calls, and bad args to <i>walk_output()</i>, result in  <i>die()</i>.  Use an eval if you wish to catch these errors and continue processing.</div>
