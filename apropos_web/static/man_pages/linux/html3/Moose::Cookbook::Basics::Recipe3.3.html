<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This recipe shows how various advanced attribute features can be used to create complex and powerful behaviors. In particular, we introduce a number of new attribute options, including &quot;predicate&quot;, &quot;lazy&quot;, and &quot;trigger&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The example class is a classic binary tree. Each node in the tree is itself an instance of &quot;BinaryTree&quot;. It has a &quot;node&quot;, which holds some arbitrary value. It has &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; attributes, which refer to its child trees, and a &quot;parent&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Let's take a look at the &quot;node&quot; attribute:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  has 'node' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'Any' );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Moose generates a read-write accessor for this attribute. The type constraint is &quot;Any&quot;, which literally means it can contain anything.<div class="spacer">
</div>
We could have left out the &quot;isa&quot; option, but in this case, we are including it for the benefit of other programmers, not the computer.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Next, let's move on to the &quot;parent&quot; attribute:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  has 'parent' =&gt; (<br/>
      is        =&gt; 'rw',<br/>
      isa       =&gt; 'BinaryTree',<br/>
      predicate =&gt; 'has_parent',<br/>
      weak_ref  =&gt; 1,<br/>
  );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Again, we have a read-write accessor. This time, the &quot;isa&quot; option says that this attribute must always be an instance of &quot;BinaryTree&quot;. In the second recipe, we saw that every time we create a Moose-based class, we also get a corresponding class type constraint.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;predicate&quot; option is new. It creates a method which can be used to check whether or not a given attribute has been initialized. In this case, the method is named &quot;has_parent&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This brings us to our last attribute option, &quot;weak_ref&quot;. Since &quot;parent&quot; is a circular reference (the tree in &quot;parent&quot; should already have a reference to this one, in its &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; attribute), we want to make sure that we weaken the reference to avoid memory leaks. If &quot;weak_ref&quot; is true, it alters the accessor function so that the reference is weakened when it is set.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Finally, we have the the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; attributes. They are essentially identical except for their names, so we'll just look at &quot;left&quot;:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  has 'left' =&gt; (<br/>
      is        =&gt; 'rw',<br/>
      isa       =&gt; 'BinaryTree',<br/>
      predicate =&gt; 'has_left',<br/>
      lazy      =&gt; 1,<br/>
      default   =&gt; sub { BinaryTree-&gt;new( parent =&gt; $_[0] ) },<br/>
      trigger   =&gt; \&amp;_set_parent_for_child<br/>
  );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are three new options here, &quot;lazy&quot;, &quot;default&quot;, and &quot;trigger&quot;. The &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;default&quot; options options are linked.  In fact, you cannot have a &quot;lazy&quot; attribute unless it has a &quot;default&quot; (or a &quot;builder&quot;, but we'll cover that later). If you try to make an attribute lazy without a default, class creation will fail with an exception. (2)<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the second recipe the <b>BankAccount</b>'s &quot;balance&quot; attribute had a default value of 0. Given a non-reference, Perl copies the  <i>value</i>. However, given a reference, it does not do a deep clone, instead simply copying the reference. If you just specified a simple reference for a default, Perl would create it once and it would be shared by all objects with that attribute.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a workaround, we use an anonymous subroutine to generate a new reference every time the default is called.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  has 'foo' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw', default =&gt; sub { [] } );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In fact, using a non-subroutine reference as a default is illegal in Moose.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  # will fail<br/>
  has 'foo' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw', default =&gt; [] );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This will blow up, so don't do it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You'll notice that we use $_[0] in our default sub. When the default subroutine is executed, it is called as a method on the object.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In our case, we're making a new &quot;BinaryTree&quot; object in our default, with the current tree as the parent.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Normally, when an object is instantiated, any defaults are evaluated immediately. With our &quot;BinaryTree&quot; class, this would be a big problem! We'd create the first object, which would immediately try to populate its &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; attributes, which would create a new &quot;BinaryTree&quot;, which would populate  <i>its</i> &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; slots. Kaboom!<div class="spacer">
</div>
By making our &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; attributes &quot;lazy&quot;, we avoid this problem. If the attribute has a value when it is read, the default is never executed at all.<div class="spacer">
</div>
We still have one last bit of behavior to add. The autogenerated &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; accessors are not quite correct. When one of these is set, we want to make sure that we update the parent of the &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; attribute's tree.<div class="spacer">
</div>
We could write our own accessors, but then why use Moose at all? Instead, we use a &quot;trigger&quot;. A &quot;trigger&quot; accepts a subroutine reference, which will be called as a method whenever the attribute is set. This can happen both during object construction or later by passing a new object to the attribute's accessor method. However, it is not called when a value is provided by a &quot;default&quot; or &quot;builder&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  sub _set_parent_for_child {<br/>
      my ( $self, $child ) = @_;<br/>
<br/>
      confess &quot;You cannot insert a tree which already has a parent&quot;<br/>
          if $child-&gt;has_parent;<br/>
<br/>
      $child-&gt;parent($self);<br/>
  }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This trigger does two things. First, it ensures that the new child node does not already have a parent. This is done for the sake of simplifying the example. If we wanted to be more clever, we would remove the child from its old parent tree and add it to the new one.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the child has no parent, we will add it to the current tree, and we ensure that is has the correct value for its &quot;parent&quot; attribute.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As with all the other recipes, <b>BinaryTree</b> can be used just like any other Perl 5 class. A more detailed example of its usage can be found in  <i>t/recipes/moose_cookbook_basics_recipe3.t</i>.</div>

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1> This recipe introduced several of Moose's advanced features. We hope that this inspires you to think of other ways these features can be used to simplify your code.</div>

Weak references are tricky things, and should be used sparingly and appropriately (such as in the case of circular refs). If you are not careful, attribute values could disappear &quot;mysteriously&quot; because Perl's reference counting garbage collector has gone and removed the item you are weak-referencing.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In short, don't use them unless you know what you are doing :)</dd>

<dd>
You <i>can</i> use the &quot;default&quot; option without the &quot;lazy&quot; option if you like, as we showed in the second recipe.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Also, you can use &quot;builder&quot; instead of &quot;default&quot;. See Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe8 for details.</dd>
