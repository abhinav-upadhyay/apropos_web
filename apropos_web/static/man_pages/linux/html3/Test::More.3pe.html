<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <b>STOP!</b> If you're just getting started writing tests, have a look at Test::Simple first.  This is a drop in replacement for Test::Simple which you can switch to once you get the hang of basic testing.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The purpose of this module is to provide a wide range of testing utilities.  Various ways to say &quot;ok&quot; with better diagnostics, facilities to skip tests, test future features and compare complicated data structures.  While you can do almost anything with a simple &quot;ok()&quot; function, it doesn't provide good diagnostic output.<div class="subsection">
<h2>I love it when a plan comes together</h2> Before anything else, you need a testing plan.  This basically declares how many tests your script is going to run to protect against premature failure.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The preferred way to do this is to declare a plan when you &quot;use Test::More&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  use Test::More tests =&gt; 23;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There are cases when you will not know beforehand how many tests your script is going to run.  In this case, you can declare your tests at the end.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  use Test::More;<br/>
<br/>
  ... run your tests ...<br/>
<br/>
  done_testing( $number_of_tests_run );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Sometimes you really don't know how many tests were run, or it's too difficult to calculate.  In which case you can leave off $number_of_tests_run.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In some cases, you'll want to completely skip an entire testing script.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  use Test::More skip_all =&gt; $skip_reason;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Your script will declare a skip with the reason why you skipped and exit immediately with a zero (success).  See Test::Harness for details.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to control what functions Test::More will export, you have to use the 'import' option.  For example, to import everything but 'fail', you'd do:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  use Test::More tests =&gt; 23, import =&gt; ['!fail'];<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Alternatively, you can use the <i>plan()</i> function.  Useful for when you have to calculate the number of tests.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  use Test::More;<br/>
  plan tests =&gt; keys %Stuff * 3;<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
or for deciding between running the tests at all:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  use Test::More;<br/>
  if( $^O eq 'MacOS' ) {<br/>
      plan skip_all =&gt; 'Test irrelevant on MacOS';<br/>
  }<br/>
  else {<br/>
      plan tests =&gt; 42;<br/>
  }<br/>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>done_testing</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
    done_testing();<br/>
    done_testing($number_of_tests);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you don't know how many tests you're going to run, you can issue the plan when you're done running tests.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
$number_of_tests is the same as <i>plan()</i>, it's the number of tests you expected to run.  You can omit this, in which case the number of tests you ran doesn't matter, just the fact that your tests ran to conclusion.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is safer than and replaces the &quot;no_plan&quot; plan.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Test names</h2> By convention, each test is assigned a number in order.  This is largely done automatically for you.  However, it's often very useful to assign a name to each test.  Which would you rather see:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  ok 4<br/>
  not ok 5<br/>
  ok 6<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
or<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  ok 4 - basic multi-variable<br/>
  not ok 5 - simple exponential<br/>
  ok 6 - force == mass * acceleration<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The later gives you some idea of what failed.  It also makes it easier to find the test in your script, simply search for &quot;simple exponential&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All test functions take a name argument.  It's optional, but highly suggested that you use it.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>I'm ok, you're not ok.</h2> The basic purpose of this module is to print out either &quot;ok #&quot; or &quot;not ok #&quot; depending on if a given test succeeded or failed.  Everything else is just gravy.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All of the following print &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;not ok&quot; depending on if the test succeeded or failed.  They all also return true or false, respectively.<dl>
<dt>
<b>ok</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  ok($got eq $expected, $test_name);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This simply evaluates any expression (&quot;$got eq $expected&quot; is just a simple example) and uses that to determine if the test succeeded or failed.  A true expression passes, a false one fails.  Very simple.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For example:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    ok( $exp{9} == 81,                   'simple exponential' );<br/>
    ok( Film-&gt;can('db_Main'),            'set_db()' );<br/>
    ok( $p-&gt;tests == 4,                  'saw tests' );<br/>
    ok( !grep !defined $_, @items,       'items populated' );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(Mnemonic:  &quot;This is ok.&quot;)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
$test_name is a very short description of the test that will be printed out.  It makes it very easy to find a test in your script when it fails and gives others an idea of your intentions.  $test_name is optional, but we  <b>very</b> strongly encourage its use.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Should an <i>ok()</i> fail, it will produce some diagnostics:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    not ok 18 - sufficient mucus<br/>
    #   Failed test 'sufficient mucus'<br/>
    #   in foo.t at line 42.<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is the same as Test::Simple's <i>ok()</i> routine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>is</b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>isnt</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  is  ( $got, $expected, $test_name );<br/>
  isnt( $got, $expected, $test_name );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Similar to <i>ok()</i>, <i>is()</i> and <i>isnt()</i> compare their two arguments with &quot;eq&quot; and &quot;ne&quot; respectively and use the result of that to determine if the test succeeded or failed.  So these:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    # Is the ultimate answer 42?<br/>
    is( ultimate_answer(), 42,          &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; );<br/>
<br/>
    # $foo isn't empty<br/>
    isnt( $foo, '',     &quot;Got some foo&quot; );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
are similar to these:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    ok( ultimate_answer() eq 42,        &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; );<br/>
    ok( $foo ne '',     &quot;Got some foo&quot; );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
&quot;undef&quot; will only ever match &quot;undef&quot;.  So you can test a value agains &quot;undef&quot; like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    is($not_defined, undef, &quot;undefined as expected&quot;);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(Mnemonic:  &quot;This is that.&quot;  &quot;This isn't that.&quot;)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
So why use these?  They produce better diagnostics on failure.  <i>ok()</i> cannot know what you are testing for (beyond the name), but  <i>is()</i> and  <i>isnt()</i> know what the test was and why it failed.  For example this test:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $foo = 'waffle';  my $bar = 'yarblokos';<br/>
    is( $foo, $bar,   'Is foo the same as bar?' );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Will produce something like this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    not ok 17 - Is foo the same as bar?<br/>
    #   Failed test 'Is foo the same as bar?'<br/>
    #   in foo.t at line 139.<br/>
    #          got: 'waffle'<br/>
    #     expected: 'yarblokos'<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
So you can figure out what went wrong without rerunning the test.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You are encouraged to use <i>is()</i> and <i>isnt()</i> over <i>ok()</i> where possible, however do not be tempted to use them to find out if something is true or false!<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  # XXX BAD!<br/>
  is( exists $brooklyn{tree}, 1, 'A tree grows in Brooklyn' );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This does not check if &quot;exists $brooklyn{tree}&quot; is true, it checks if it returns 1.  Very different.  Similar caveats exist for false and 0. In these cases, use  <i>ok()</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  ok( exists $brooklyn{tree},    'A tree grows in Brooklyn' );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A simple call to <i>isnt()</i> usually does not provide a strong test but there are cases when you cannot say much more about a value than that it is different from some other value:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  new_ok $obj, &quot;Foo&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
  my $clone = $obj-&gt;clone;<br/>
  isa_ok $obj, &quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;Foo-&gt;clone&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
  isnt $obj, $clone, &quot;clone() produces a different object&quot;;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For those grammatical pedants out there, there's an &quot;isn't()&quot; function which is an alias of  <i>isnt()</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>like</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  like( $got, qr/expected/, $test_name );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Similar to <i>ok()</i>, <i>like()</i> matches $got against the regex &quot;qr/expected/&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
So this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    like($got, qr/expected/, 'this is like that');<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
is similar to:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    ok( $got =~ /expected/, 'this is like that');<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
(Mnemonic &quot;This is like that&quot;.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The second argument is a regular expression.  It may be given as a regex reference (i.e. &quot;qr//&quot;) or (for better compatibility with older perls) as a string that looks like a regex (alternative delimiters are currently not supported):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    like( $got, '/expected/', 'this is like that' );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Regex options may be placed on the end ('/expected/i').<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Its advantages over <i>ok()</i> are similar to that of <i>is()</i> and <i>isnt()</i>.  Better diagnostics on failure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>unlike</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  unlike( $got, qr/expected/, $test_name );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Works exactly as <i>like()</i>, only it checks if $got <b>does not</b> match the given pattern.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>cmp_ok</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  cmp_ok( $got, $op, $expected, $test_name );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Halfway between <i>ok()</i> and <i>is()</i> lies <i>cmp_ok()</i>.  This allows you to compare two arguments using any binary perl operator.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    # ok( $got eq $expected );<br/>
    cmp_ok( $got, 'eq', $expected, 'this eq that' );<br/>
<br/>
    # ok( $got == $expected );<br/>
    cmp_ok( $got, '==', $expected, 'this == that' );<br/>
<br/>
    # ok( $got &amp;&amp; $expected );<br/>
    cmp_ok( $got, '&amp;&amp;', $expected, 'this &amp;&amp; that' );<br/>
    ...etc...<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Its advantage over <i>ok()</i> is when the test fails you'll know what $got and $expected were:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    not ok 1<br/>
    #   Failed test in foo.t at line 12.<br/>
    #     '23'<br/>
    #         &amp;&amp;<br/>
    #     undef<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It's also useful in those cases where you are comparing numbers and  <i>is()</i>'s use of &quot;eq&quot; will interfere:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    cmp_ok( $big_hairy_number, '==', $another_big_hairy_number );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It's especially useful when comparing greater-than or smaller-than relation between values:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    cmp_ok( $some_value, '&lt;=', $upper_limit );<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>can_ok</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  can_ok($module, @methods);<br/>
  can_ok($object, @methods);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Checks to make sure the $module or $object can do these @methods (works with functions, too).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    can_ok('Foo', qw(this that whatever));<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
is almost exactly like saying:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    ok( Foo-&gt;can('this') &amp;&amp; <br/>
        Foo-&gt;can('that') &amp;&amp; <br/>
        Foo-&gt;can('whatever') <br/>
      );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
only without all the typing and with a better interface.  Handy for quickly testing an interface.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
No matter how many @methods you check, a single <i>can_ok()</i> call counts as one test.  If you desire otherwise, use:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    foreach my $meth (@methods) {<br/>
        can_ok('Foo', $meth);<br/>
    }<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>isa_ok</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  isa_ok($object,   $class, $object_name);<br/>
  isa_ok($subclass, $class, $object_name);<br/>
  isa_ok($ref,      $type,  $ref_name);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Checks to see if the given &quot;$object-&gt;isa($class)&quot;.  Also checks to make sure the object was defined in the first place.  Handy for this sort of thing:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $obj = Some::Module-&gt;new;<br/>
    isa_ok( $obj, 'Some::Module' );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
where you'd otherwise have to write<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $obj = Some::Module-&gt;new;<br/>
    ok( defined $obj &amp;&amp; $obj-&gt;isa('Some::Module') );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
to safeguard against your test script blowing up.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You can also test a class, to make sure that it has the right ancestor:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    isa_ok( 'Vole', 'Rodent' );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It works on references, too:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    isa_ok( $array_ref, 'ARRAY' );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The diagnostics of this test normally just refer to 'the object'.  If you'd like them to be more specific, you can supply an $object_name (for example 'Test customer').</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>new_ok</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  my $obj = new_ok( $class );<br/>
  my $obj = new_ok( $class =&gt; \@args );<br/>
  my $obj = new_ok( $class =&gt; \@args, $object_name );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A convenience function which combines creating an object and calling  <i>isa_ok()</i> on that object.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It is basically equivalent to:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $obj = $class-&gt;new(@args);<br/>
    isa_ok $obj, $class, $object_name;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If @args is not given, an empty list will be used.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This function only works on <i>new()</i> and it assumes <i>new()</i> will return just a single object which isa $class.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>subtest</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
    subtest $name =&gt; \&amp;code;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>subtest()</i> runs the &amp;code as its own little test with its own plan and its own result.  The main test counts this as a single test using the result of the whole subtest to determine if its ok or not ok.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For example...<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  use Test::More tests =&gt; 3;<br/>
 <br/>
  pass(&quot;First test&quot;);<br/>
<br/>
  subtest 'An example subtest' =&gt; sub {<br/>
      plan tests =&gt; 2;<br/>
<br/>
      pass(&quot;This is a subtest&quot;);<br/>
      pass(&quot;So is this&quot;);<br/>
  };<br/>
<br/>
  pass(&quot;Third test&quot;);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This would produce.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  1..3<br/>
  ok 1 - First test<br/>
      1..2<br/>
      ok 1 - This is a subtest<br/>
      ok 2 - So is this<br/>
  ok 2 - An example subtest<br/>
  ok 3 - Third test<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A subtest may call &quot;skip_all&quot;.  No tests will be run, but the subtest is considered a skip.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  subtest 'skippy' =&gt; sub {<br/>
      plan skip_all =&gt; 'cuz I said so';<br/>
      pass('this test will never be run');<br/>
  };<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Returns true if the subtest passed, false otherwise.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Due to how subtests work, you may omit a plan if you desire.  This adds an implicit &quot;done_testing()&quot; to the end of your subtest.  The following two subtests are equivalent:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  subtest 'subtest with implicit done_testing()', sub {<br/>
      ok 1, 'subtests with an implicit done testing should work';<br/>

<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Sometimes you just want to say that the tests have passed.  Usually the case is you've got some complicated condition that is difficult to wedge into an  <i>ok()</i>.  In this case, you can simply use <i>pass()</i> (to declare the test ok) or fail (for not ok).  They are synonyms for  <i>ok</i>(1) and <i>ok</i>(0).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Use these very, very, very sparingly.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Module tests</h2> You usually want to test if the module you're testing loads ok, rather than just vomiting if its load fails.  For such purposes we have &quot;use_ok&quot; and &quot;require_ok&quot;.<dl>
<dt>
<b>use_ok</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
   BEGIN { use_ok($module); }<br/>
   BEGIN { use_ok($module, @imports); }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
These simply use the given $module and test to make sure the load happened ok.  It's recommended that you run  <i>use_ok()</i> inside a BEGIN block so its functions are exported at compile-time and prototypes are properly honored.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If @imports are given, they are passed through to the use.  So this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   BEGIN { use_ok('Some::Module', qw(foo bar)) }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
is like doing this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   use Some::Module qw(foo bar);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Version numbers can be checked like so:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   # Just like &quot;use Some::Module 1.02&quot;<br/>
   BEGIN { use_ok('Some::Module', 1.02) }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Don't try to do this:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
   BEGIN {<br/>
       use_ok('Some::Module');<br/>
<br/>
       ...some code that depends on the use...<br/>
       ...happening at compile time...<br/>
   }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
because the notion of &quot;compile-time&quot; is relative.  Instead, you want:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  BEGIN { use_ok('Some::Module') }<br/>
  BEGIN { ...some code that depends on the use... }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If you want the equivalent of &quot;use Foo ()&quot;, use a module but not import anything, use &quot;require_ok&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  BEGIN { require_ok &quot;Foo&quot; }<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>require_ok</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
   require_ok($module);<br/>
   require_ok($file);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Like <i>use_ok()</i>, except it requires the $module or $file.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Complex data structures</h2> Not everything is a simple eq check or regex.  There are times you need to see if two data structures are equivalent.  For these instances Test::More provides a handful of useful functions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>NOTE</b> I'm not quite sure what will happen with filehandles.<dl>
<dt>
<b>is_deeply</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  is_deeply( $got, $expected, $test_name );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Similar to <i>is()</i>, except that if $got and $expected are references, it does a deep comparison walking each data structure to see if they are equivalent.  If the two structures are different, it will display the place where they start differing.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>is_deeply()</i> compares the dereferenced values of references, the references themselves (except for their type) are ignored.  This means aspects such as blessing and ties are not considered &quot;different&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<i>is_deeply()</i> currently has very limited handling of function reference and globs.  It merely checks if they have the same referent.  This may improve in the future.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Test::Differences and Test::Deep provide more in-depth functionality along these lines.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Diagnostics</h2> If you pick the right test function, you'll usually get a good idea of what went wrong when it failed.  But sometimes it doesn't work out that way.  So here we have ways for you to write your own diagnostic messages which are safer than just &quot;print STDERR&quot;.<dl>
<dt>
<b>diag</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  diag(@diagnostic_message);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Prints a diagnostic message which is guaranteed not to interfere with test output.  Like &quot;print&quot; @diagnostic_message is simply concatenated together.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Returns false, so as to preserve failure.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Handy for this sort of thing:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    ok( grep(/foo/, @users), &quot;There's a foo user&quot; ) or<br/>
        diag(&quot;Since there's no foo, check that /etc/bar is set up right&quot;);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
which would produce:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    not ok 42 - There's a foo user<br/>
    #   Failed test 'There's a foo user'<br/>
    #   in foo.t at line 52.<br/>
    # Since there's no foo, check that /etc/bar is set up right.<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You might remember &quot;ok() or diag()&quot; with the mnemonic &quot;open() or die()&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>NOTE</b> The exact formatting of the diagnostic output is still changing, but it is guaranteed that whatever you throw at it it won't interfere with the test.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>note</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  note(@diagnostic_message);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Like <i>diag()</i>, except the message will not be seen when the test is run in a harness.  It will only be visible in the verbose TAP stream.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Handy for putting in notes which might be useful for debugging, but don't indicate a problem.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    note(&quot;Tempfile is $tempfile&quot;);<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>explain</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  my @dump = explain @diagnostic_message;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Will dump the contents of any references in a human readable format. Usually you want to pass this into &quot;note&quot; or &quot;diag&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Handy for things like...<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    is_deeply($have, $want) || diag explain $have;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Conditional tests</h2> Sometimes running a test under certain conditions will cause the test script to die.  A certain function or method isn't implemented (such as  <i>fork()</i> on MacOS), some resource isn't available (like a net connection) or a module isn't available.  In these cases it's necessary to skip tests, or declare that they are supposed to fail but will work in the future (a todo test).<div class="spacer">
</div>
For more details on the mechanics of skip and todo tests see Test::Harness.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The way Test::More handles this is with a named block.  Basically, a block of tests which can be skipped over or made todo.  It's best if I just show you...<dl>
<dt>
<b>SKIP: BLOCK</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
  SKIP: {<br/>
      skip $why, $how_many if $condition;<br/>
<br/>
      ...normal testing code goes here...<br/>
  }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This declares a block of tests that might be skipped, $how_many tests there are, $why and under what $condition to skip them.  An example is the easiest way to illustrate:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    SKIP: {<br/>
        eval { require HTML::Lint };<br/>
<br/>
        skip &quot;HTML::Lint not installed&quot;, 2 if $@;<br/>
<br/>
        my $lint = new HTML::Lint;<br/>
        isa_ok( $lint, &quot;HTML::Lint&quot; );<br/>
<br/>
        $lint-&gt;parse( $html );<br/>
        is( $lint-&gt;errors, 0, &quot;No errors found in HTML&quot; );<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the user does not have HTML::Lint installed, the whole block of code  <i>won't be run at all</i>.  Test::More will output special ok's which Test::Harness interprets as skipped, but passing, tests.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It's important that $how_many accurately reflects the number of tests in the SKIP block so the # of tests run will match up with your plan. If your plan is &quot;no_plan&quot; $how_many is optional and will default to 1.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
It's perfectly safe to nest SKIP blocks.  Each SKIP block must have the label &quot;SKIP&quot;, or Test::More can't work its magic.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
You don't skip tests which are failing because there's a bug in your program, or for which you don't yet have code written.  For that you use TODO.  Read on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>TODO: BLOCK</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
    TODO: {<br/>
        local $TODO = $why if $condition;<br/>
<br/>
        ...normal testing code goes here...<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Declares a block of tests you expect to fail and $why.  Perhaps it's because you haven't fixed a bug or haven't finished a new feature:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    TODO: {<br/>
        local $TODO = &quot;URI::Geller not finished&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
        my $card = &quot;Eight of clubs&quot;;<br/>
        is( URI::Geller-&gt;your_card, $card, 'Is THIS your card?' );<br/>
<br/>
        my $spoon;<br/>
        URI::Geller-&gt;bend_spoon;<br/>
        is( $spoon, 'bent',    &quot;Spoon bending, that's original&quot; );<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With a todo block, the tests inside are expected to fail.  Test::More will run the tests normally, but print out special flags indicating they are &quot;todo&quot;.  Test::Harness will interpret failures as being ok. Should anything succeed, it will report it as an unexpected success. You then know the thing you had todo is done and can remove the TODO flag.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The nice part about todo tests, as opposed to simply commenting out a block of tests, is it's like having a programmatic todo list.  You know how much work is left to be done, you're aware of what bugs there are, and you'll know immediately when they're fixed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Once a todo test starts succeeding, simply move it outside the block. When the block is empty, delete it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>todo_skip</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
    TODO: {<br/>
        todo_skip $why, $how_many if $condition;<br/>
<br/>
        ...normal testing code...<br/>
    }<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
With todo tests, it's best to have the tests actually run.  That way you'll know when they start passing.  Sometimes this isn't possible. Often a failing test will cause the whole program to die or hang, even inside an &quot;eval BLOCK&quot; with and using &quot;alarm&quot;.  In these extreme cases you have no choice but to skip over the broken tests entirely.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The syntax and behavior is similar to a &quot;SKIP: BLOCK&quot; except the tests will be marked as failing but todo.  Test::Harness will interpret them as passing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
When do I use SKIP vs. TODO?</dt>
<dd>
<b>If it's something the user might not be able to do</b>, use SKIP. This includes optional modules that aren't installed, running under an OS that doesn't have some feature (like  <i>fork()</i> or symlinks), or maybe you need an Internet connection and one isn't available.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>If it's something the programmer hasn't done yet</b>, use TODO.  This is for any code you haven't written yet, or bugs you have yet to fix, but want to put tests in your testing script (always a good idea).</dd>
</dl>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Test control</h2><dl>
<dt>
<b>BAIL_OUT</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
    BAIL_OUT($reason);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Indicates to the harness that things are going so badly all testing should terminate.  This includes the running of any additional test scripts.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This is typically used when testing cannot continue such as a critical module failing to compile or a necessary external utility not being available such as a database connection failing.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h2>Discouraged comparison functions</h2> The use of the following functions is discouraged as they are not actually testing functions and produce no diagnostics to help figure out what went wrong.  They were written before  <i>is_deeply()</i> existed because I couldn't figure out how to display a useful diff of two arbitrary data structures.<div class="spacer">
</div>
These functions are usually used inside an <i>ok()</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    ok( eq_array(\@got, \@expected) );<br/>

&quot;is_deeply()&quot; can do that better and with diagnostics.<div class="spacer">

<dd>
<br/>
  my $is_eq = eq_set(\@got, \@expected);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Similar to <i>eq_array()</i>, except the order of the elements is <b>not</b> important.  This is a deep check, but the irrelevancy of order only applies to the top level.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    ok( eq_set(\@got, \@expected) );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Is better written:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    is_deeply( [sort @got], [sort @expected] );<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>NOTE</b> By historical accident, this is not a true set comparison. While the order of elements does not matter, duplicate elements do.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>NOTE</b> <i>eq_set()</i> does not know how to deal with references at the top level.  The following is an example of a comparison which might not work:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    eq_set([\1, \2], [\2, \1]);<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

Test::Deep contains much better set comparison functions.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Extending and Embedding Test::More</h2> Sometimes the Test::More interface isn't quite enough.  Fortunately, Test::More is built on top of Test::Builder which provides a single, unified backend for any test library to use.  This means two test libraries which both use Test::Builder  <b>can be used together in the</b>  <b>same program</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you simply want to do a little tweaking of how the tests behave, you can access the underlying Test::Builder object like so:<dl>
<dt>
<b>builder</b></dt>
<dd>
<br/>
    my $test_builder = Test::More-&gt;builder;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Returns the Test::Builder object underlying Test::More for you to play with.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXIT CODES</h1> If all your tests passed, Test::Builder will exit with zero (which is normal).  If anything failed it will exit with how many failed.  If you run less (or more) tests than you planned, the missing (or extras) will be considered failures.  If no tests were ever run Test::Builder will throw a warning and exit with 255.  If the test died, even after having successfully completed all its tests, it will still be considered a failure and will exit with 255.<div class="spacer">
</div>
So the exit codes are...<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    0                   all tests successful<br/>
    255                 test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run<br/>
    any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>NOTE</b>  This behavior may go away in future versions.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CAVEATS and NOTES</h1><dl>
<dt>
Backwards compatibility</dt>
<dd>
Test::More works with Perls as old as 5.6.0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
utf8 / &quot;Wide character in print&quot;</dt>
<dd>
If you use utf8 or other non-ASCII characters with Test::More you might get a &quot;Wide character in print&quot; warning.  Using &quot;binmode STDOUT, &quot;:utf8&quot;&quot; will not fix it.  Test::Builder (which powers Test::More) duplicates STDOUT and STDERR.  So any changes to them, including changing their output disciplines, will not be seem by Test::More.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The work around is to change the filehandles used by Test::Builder directly.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    my $builder = Test::More-&gt;builder;<br/>
    binmode $builder-&gt;output,         &quot;:utf8&quot;;<br/>
    binmode $builder-&gt;failure_output, &quot;:utf8&quot;;<br/>
    binmode $builder-&gt;todo_output,    &quot;:utf8&quot;;<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Overloaded objects</dt>
<dd>
String overloaded objects are compared <b>as strings</b> (or in <i>cmp_ok()</i>'s case, strings or numbers as appropriate to the comparison op).  This prevents Test::More from piercing an object's interface allowing better blackbox testing.  So if a function starts returning overloaded objects instead of bare strings your tests won't notice the difference.  This is good.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
However, it does mean that functions like <i>is_deeply()</i> cannot be used to test the internals of string overloaded objects.  In this case I would suggest Test::Deep which contains more flexible testing functions for complex data structures.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Threads</dt>
<dd>
Test::More will only be aware of threads if &quot;use threads&quot; has been done  <i>before</i> Test::More is loaded.  This is ok:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use threads;<br/>
    use Test::More;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This may cause problems:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
    use Test::More<br/>
    use threads;<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">

5.8.1 and above are supported.  Anything below that has too many bugs.</dd>

<div class="section">
<h1>HISTORY</h1> This is a case of convergent evolution with Joshua Pritikin's Test module.  I was largely unaware of its existence when I'd first written my own  <i>ok()</i> routines.  This module exists because I can't figure out how to easily wedge test names into Test's interface (along with a few other problems).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The goal here is to have a testing utility that's simple to learn, quick to use and difficult to trip yourself up with while still providing more flexibility than the existing Test.pm.  As such, the names of the most common routines are kept tiny, special cases and magic side-effects are kept to a minimum.  WYSIWYG.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SEE ALSO</h1> Test::Simple if all this confuses you and you just want to write some tests.  You can upgrade to Test::More later (it's forward compatible).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Test::Harness is the test runner and output interpreter for Perl. It's the thing that powers &quot;make test&quot; and where the &quot;prove&quot; utility comes from.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Test::Legacy tests written with Test.pm, the original testing module, do not play well with other testing libraries.  Test::Legacy emulates the Test.pm interface and does play well with others.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Test::Differences for more ways to test complex data structures. And it plays well with Test::More.<div class="spacer">
