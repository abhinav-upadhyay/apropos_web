When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a  <i>GraphicsExpose</i> event to a client application, it sends an  <i>XGraphicsExposeEvent</i> structure with the type member set to  <i>GraphicsExpose</i>. The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set to  <i>True</i> if the event came from a  <i>SendEvent</i> protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The event member is set either to the reconfigured window or to its parent, depending on whether  <i>StructureNotify</i> or  <i>SubstructureNotify</i> was selected. The window member is set to the window whose size, position, border, and/or stacking order was changed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The x and y members are set to the coordinates relative to the parent window's origin and indicate the position of the upper-left outside corner of the window. The width and height members are set to the inside size of the window, not including the border. The border_width member is set to the width of the window's border, in pixels.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The above member is set to the sibling window and is used for stacking operations. If the X server sets this member to  <i>None</i>, the window whose state was changed is on the bottom of the stack with respect to sibling windows. However, if this member is set to a sibling window, the window whose state was changed is placed on top of this sibling window.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect attribute of the window. Window manager clients normally should ignore this window if the override_redirect member is  <i>True</i>.</div>
