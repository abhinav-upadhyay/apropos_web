<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The glob angle-bracket operator &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; is a pathname generator that implements the rules for file name pattern matching used by Unix-like shells such as the Bourne shell or C shell.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>File::Glob::bsd_glob()</i> implements the FreeBSD <i>glob</i>(3) routine, which is a superset of the POSIX  <i>glob()</i> (described in IEEE Std 1003.2 &quot;POSIX.2&quot;).  <i>bsd_glob()</i> takes a mandatory &quot;pattern&quot; argument, and an optional &quot;flags&quot; argument, and returns a list of filenames matching the pattern, with interpretation of the pattern modified by the &quot;flags&quot; variable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since v5.6.0, Perl's <i>CORE::glob()</i> is implemented in terms of <i>bsd_glob()</i>. Note that they don't share the same prototype-- <i>CORE::glob()</i> only accepts a single argument.  Due to historical reasons,  <i>CORE::glob()</i> will also split its argument on whitespace, treating it as multiple patterns, whereas  <i>bsd_glob()</i> considers them as one pattern.<div class="subsection">
<h2>META CHARACTERS</h2><br/>
  \       Quote the next metacharacter<br/>
  []      Character class<br/>
  {}      Multiple pattern<br/>
  *       Match any string of characters<br/>
  ?       Match any single character<br/>
  ~       User name home directory<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The metanotation &quot;a{b,c,d}e&quot; is a shorthand for &quot;abe ace ade&quot;.  Left to right order is preserved, with results of matches being sorted separately at a low level to preserve this order. As a special case &quot;{&quot;, &quot;}&quot;, and &quot;{}&quot; are passed undisturbed.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>POSIX FLAGS</h2> The POSIX defined flags for  <i>bsd_glob()</i> are:<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_ERR&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Force <i>bsd_glob()</i> to return an error when it encounters a directory it cannot open or read.  Ordinarily  <i>bsd_glob()</i> continues to find matches.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_LIMIT&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Make <i>bsd_glob()</i> return an error (GLOB_NOSPACE) when the pattern expands to a size bigger than the system constant &quot;ARG_MAX&quot; (usually found in limits.h).  If your system does not define this constant,  <i>bsd_glob()</i> uses &quot;sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)&quot; or &quot;_POSIX_ARG_MAX&quot; where available (in that order).  You can inspect these values using the standard &quot;POSIX&quot; extension.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_MARK&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Each pathname that is a directory that matches the pattern has a slash appended.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_NOCASE&quot;</dt>
<dd>
By default, file names are assumed to be case sensitive; this flag makes  <i>bsd_glob()</i> treat case differences as not significant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_NOCHECK&quot;</dt>
<dd>
If the pattern does not match any pathname, then <i>bsd_glob()</i> returns a list consisting of only the pattern.  If &quot;GLOB_QUOTE&quot; is set, its effect is present in the pattern returned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_NOSORT&quot;</dt>
<dd>
By default, the pathnames are sorted in ascending ASCII order; this flag prevents that sorting (speeding up  <i>bsd_glob()</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The FreeBSD extensions to the POSIX standard are the following flags:<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_BRACE&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Pre-process the string to expand &quot;{pat,pat,...}&quot; strings like <i>csh</i>(1). The pattern '{}' is left unexpanded for historical reasons (and  <i>csh</i>(1) does the same thing to ease typing of  <i>find</i>(1) patterns).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_NOMAGIC&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Same as &quot;GLOB_NOCHECK&quot; but it only returns the pattern if it does not contain any of the special characters &quot;*&quot;, &quot;?&quot; or &quot;[&quot;.  &quot;NOMAGIC&quot; is provided to simplify implementing the historic  <i>csh</i>(1) globbing behaviour and should probably not be used anywhere else.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_QUOTE&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Use the backslash ('\') character for quoting: every occurrence of a backslash followed by a character in the pattern is replaced by that character, avoiding any special interpretation of the character. (But see below for exceptions on DOSISH systems).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_TILDE&quot;</dt>
<dd>
Expand patterns that start with '~' to user name home directories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_CSH&quot;</dt>
<dd>
For convenience, &quot;GLOB_CSH&quot; is a synonym for &quot;GLOB_BRACE | GLOB_NOMAGIC | GLOB_QUOTE | GLOB_TILDE | GLOB_ALPHASORT&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The POSIX provided &quot;GLOB_APPEND&quot;, &quot;GLOB_DOOFFS&quot;, and the FreeBSD extensions &quot;GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC&quot;, and &quot;GLOB_MAGCHAR&quot; flags have not been implemented in the Perl version because they involve more complex interaction with the underlying C structures.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following flag has been added in the Perl implementation for csh compatibility:<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_ALPHASORT&quot;</dt>
<dd>
If &quot;GLOB_NOSORT&quot; is not in effect, sort filenames is alphabetical order (case does not matter) rather than in ASCII order.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1>  <i>bsd_glob()</i> returns a list of matching paths, possibly zero length.  If an error occurred, &amp;File::Glob::GLOB_ERROR will be non-zero and $! will be set.  &amp;File::Glob::GLOB_ERROR is guaranteed to be zero if no error occurred, or one of the following values otherwise:<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_NOSPACE&quot;</dt>
<dd>
An attempt to allocate memory failed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&quot;GLOB_ABEND&quot;</dt>
<dd>
The glob was stopped because an error was encountered.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the case where <i>bsd_glob()</i> has found some matching paths, but is interrupted by an error, it will return a list of filenames  <b>and</b> set &amp;File::Glob::ERROR.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that <i>bsd_glob()</i> deviates from POSIX and FreeBSD <i>glob</i>(3) behaviour by not considering &quot;ENOENT&quot; and &quot;ENOTDIR&quot; as errors -  <i>bsd_glob()</i> will continue processing despite those errors, unless the &quot;GLOB_ERR&quot; flag is set.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Be aware that all filenames returned from File::Glob are tainted.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1><dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
If you want to use multiple patterns, e.g. &quot;bsd_glob(&quot;a* b*&quot;)&quot;, you should probably throw them in a set as in &quot;bsd_glob(&quot;{a*,b*}&quot;)&quot;.  This is because the argument to  <i>bsd_glob()</i> isn't subjected to parsing by the C shell. Remember that you can use a backslash to escape things.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
On DOSISH systems, backslash is a valid directory separator character. In this case, use of backslash as a quoting character (via GLOB_QUOTE) interferes with the use of backslash as a directory separator. The best (simplest, most portable) solution is to use forward slashes for directory separators, and backslashes for quoting. However, this does not match &quot;normal practice&quot; on these systems. As a concession to user expectation, therefore, backslashes (under GLOB_QUOTE) only quote the glob metacharacters '[', ']', '{', '}', '-', '~', and backslash itself. All other backslashes are passed through unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Win32 users should use the real slash.  If you really want to use backslashes, consider using Sarathy's File::DosGlob, which comes with the standard Perl distribution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Mac OS (Classic) users should note a few differences. Since Mac OS is not Unix, when the glob code encounters a tilde glob (e.g. ~user) and the &quot;GLOB_TILDE&quot; flag is used, it simply returns that pattern without doing any expansion.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Glob on Mac OS is case-insensitive by default (if you don't use any flags). If you specify any flags at all and still want glob to be case-insensitive, you must include &quot;GLOB_NOCASE&quot; in the flags.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The path separator is ':' (aka colon), not '/' (aka slash). Mac OS users should be careful about specifying relative pathnames. While a full path always begins with a volume name, a relative pathname should always begin with a ':'.  If specifying a volume name only, a trailing ':' is required.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The specification of pathnames in glob patterns adheres to the usual Mac OS conventions: The path separator is a colon ':', not a slash '/'. A full path always begins with a volume name. A relative pathname on Mac OS must always begin with a ':', except when specifying a file or directory name in the current working directory, where the leading colon is optional. If specifying a volume name only, a trailing ':' is required. Due to these rules, a glob like &lt;*:&gt; will find all mounted volumes, while a glob like &lt;*&gt; or &lt;:*&gt; will find all files and directories in the current directory.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that updirs in the glob pattern are resolved before the matching begins, i.e. a pattern like &quot;*HD:t?p::a*&quot; will be matched as &quot;*HD:a*&quot;. Note also, that a single trailing ':' in the pattern is ignored (unless it's a volume name pattern like &quot;*HD:&quot;), i.e. a glob like &lt;:*:&gt; will find both directories  <i>and</i> files (and not, as one might expect, only directories). You can, however, use the &quot;GLOB_MARK&quot; flag to distinguish (without a file test) directory names from file names.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If the &quot;GLOB_MARK&quot; flag is set, all directory paths will have a ':' appended. Since a directory like 'lib:' is  <i>not</i> a valid <i>relative</i> path on Mac OS, both a leading and a trailing colon will be added, when the directory name in question doesn't contain any colons (e.g. 'lib' becomes ':lib:').</dd>
