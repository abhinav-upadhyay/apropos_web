<h1>STRUCTURES</h1> The structure for  <i>MapNotify</i> events contains:<div class="spacer">

<br/>
typedef struct {<br/>
	int type;	/* MapNotify */<br/>
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */<br/>
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a SendEvent request */<br/>

</div>
When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a  <i>GraphicsExpose</i> event to a client application, it sends an  <i>XGraphicsExposeEvent</i> structure with the type member set to  <i>GraphicsExpose</i>. The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set to  <i>True</i> if the event came from a  <i>SendEvent</i> protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The event member is set either to the window that was mapped or to its parent, depending on whether  <i>StructureNotify</i> or  <i>SubstructureNotify</i> was selected. The window member is set to the window that was mapped. The override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect attribute of the window. Window manager clients normally should ignore this window if the override-redirect attribute is  <i>True</i>, because these events usually are generated from pop-ups, which override structure control.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The structure for  <i>MappingNotify</i> events is:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
typedef struct {<br/>
	int type;	/* MappingNotify */<br/>
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */<br/>
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a SendEvent request */<br/>
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */<br/>
	Window window;	/* unused */<br/>
	int request;	/* one of MappingModifier, MappingKeyboard,<br/>
		   MappingPointer */<br/>
	int first_keycode;	/* first keycode */<br/>
	int count;	/* defines range of change w. first_keycode*/<br/>

The request member is set to indicate the kind of mapping change that occurred and can be  <i>MappingModifier</i>,  <i>MappingKeyboard</i>,  <i>MappingPointer</i>. If it is  <i>MappingModifier</i>, the modifier mapping was changed. If it is  <i>MappingKeyboard</i>, the keyboard mapping was changed. If it is  <i>MappingPointer</i>, the pointer button mapping was changed. The first_keycode and count members are set only if the request member was set to  <i>MappingKeyboard</i>. The number in first_keycode represents the first number in the range of the altered mapping, and count represents the number of keycodes altered.</div>
