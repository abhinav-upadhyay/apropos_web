<h1>NAME</h1> Task::Weaken - Ensure that a platform has weaken support</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> One recurring problem in modules that use Scalar::Util's &quot;weaken&quot; function is that it is not present in the pure-perl variant.<div class="spacer">
</div>
While this isn't necesarily always a problem in a straight CPAN-based Perl environment, some operating system distributions only include the pure-Perl versions, don't include the XS version, and so weaken is then &quot;missing&quot; from the platform,  <b>despite</b> passing a dependency on Scalar::Util successfully.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Most notably this is RedHat Linux at time of writing, but other come and go and do the same thing, hence &quot;recurring problem&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The normal solution is to manually write tests in each distribution to ensure that &quot;weaken&quot; is available.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This restores the functionality testing to a dependency you do once in your  <i>Makefile.PL</i>, rather than something you have to write extra tests for each time you write a module.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It should also help make the package auto-generators for the various operating systems play more nicely, because it introduces a dependency that they  <b>have</b> to have a proper weaken in order to work.<div class="subsection">
<h2>How this Task works</h2> Part of the problem seems to stem from the fact that some distributions continue to include modules even if they fail some of their tests.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To get around that for this module, it will do a few dirty tricks.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If Scalar::Util is not available at all, it will issue a normal dependency on the module. However, if Scalar::Util is relatively new ( it is &gt;= 1.19 ) and the module does  <b>not</b> have weaken, the install will bail out altogether with a long error encouraging the user to seek support from their vendor (this problem happens most often in vendor-packaged Perl versions).<div class="spacer">
</div>
This distribution also contains tests to ensure that weaken is available using more normal methods.<div class="spacer">
</div>
So if your module uses &quot;weaken&quot;, you can just add the following to your Module::Install-based  <i>Makefile.PL</i> (or equivalent).<div class="spacer">
