<h1>NAME</h1> B::Terse - Walk Perl syntax tree, printing terse info about ops</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
        perl -MO=Terse[,OPTIONS] foo.pl<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This version of B::Terse is really just a wrapper that calls B::Concise with the  <b>-terse</b> option. It is provided for compatibility with old scripts (and habits) but using B::Concise directly is now recommended instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For compatibility with the old B::Terse, this module also adds a method named &quot;terse&quot; to B::OP and B::SV objects. The B::SV method is largely compatible with the old one, though authors of new software might be advised to choose a more user-friendly output format. The B::OP &quot;terse&quot; method, however, doesn't work well. Since B::Terse was first written, much more information in OPs has migrated to the scratchpad datastructure, but the &quot;terse&quot; interface doesn't have any way of getting to the correct pad. As a kludge, the new version will always use the pad for the main program, but for OPs in subroutines this will give the wrong answer or crash.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>AUTHOR</h1> The original version of B::Terse was written by Malcolm Beattie, &lt;mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk&gt;. This wrapper was written by Stephen McCamant, &lt;smcc@MIT.EDU&gt;.</div>
