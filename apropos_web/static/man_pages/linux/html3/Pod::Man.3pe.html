<h1>NAME</h1> Pod::Man - Convert POD data to formatted *roff input</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
    use Pod::Man;<br/>
    my $parser = Pod::Man-&gt;new (release =&gt; $VERSION, section =&gt; 8);<br/>
<br/>
    # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT.<br/>
    $parser-&gt;parse_file (\*STDIN);<br/>
<br/>
    # Read POD from file.pod and write to file.1.<br/>
    $parser-&gt;parse_from_file ('file.pod', 'file.1');<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> Pod::Man is a module to convert documentation in the POD format (the preferred language for documenting Perl) into *roff input using the man macro set.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a terminal using  <i>nroff</i>(1), normally via <i>man</i>(1), or printing using <i>troff</i>(1). It is conventionally invoked using the driver script  <b>pod2man</b>, but it can also be used directly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a derived class from Pod::Simple, Pod::Man supports the same methods and interfaces.  See Pod::Simple for all the details.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>new()</i> can take options, in the form of key/value pairs that control the behavior of the parser.  See below for details.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If no options are given, Pod::Man uses the name of the input file with any trailing &quot;.pod&quot;, &quot;.pm&quot;, or &quot;.pl&quot; stripped as the man page title, to section 1 unless the file ended in &quot;.pm&quot; in which case it defaults to section 3, to a centered title of &quot;User Contributed Perl Documentation&quot;, to a centered footer of the Perl version it is run with, and to a left-hand footer of the modification date of its input (or the current date if given &quot;STDIN&quot; for input).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Pod::Man assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font named &quot;CW&quot;.  If yours is called something else (like &quot;CR&quot;), use the &quot;fixed&quot; option to specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output for printing.  Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and bold italic fixed-width output.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man also takes care of formatting  <i>func()</i>, <i>func</i>(3), and simple variable references like $foo or @bar so you don't have to use code escapes for them; complex expressions like $fred{'stuff'} will still need to be escaped, though.  It also translates dashes that aren't used as hyphens into en dashes, makes long dashes--like this--into proper em dashes, fixes &quot;paired quotes,&quot; makes C++ look right, puts a little space between double underscores, makes ALLCAPS a teeny bit smaller in  <b>troff</b>, and escapes stuff that *roff treats as special so that you don't have to.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The recognized options to <i>new()</i> are as follows.  All options take a single argument.<dl>
<dt>
center</dt>
<dd>
Sets the centered page header to use instead of &quot;User Contributed Perl Documentation&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
date</dt>
<dd>
Sets the left-hand footer.  By default, the modification date of the input file will be used, or the current date if  <i>stat()</i> can't find that file (the case if the input is from &quot;STDIN&quot;), and the date will be formatted as &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
fixed</dt>
<dd>
The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults to &quot;CW&quot;.  Some systems may want &quot;CR&quot; instead.  Only matters for  <b>troff</b> output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
fixedbold</dt>
<dd>
Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to &quot;CB&quot;.  Only matters for  <b>troff</b> output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
fixeditalic</dt>
<dd>
Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a misnomer, since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version, not an italic version).  Defaults to &quot;CI&quot;.  Only matters for  <b>troff</b> output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
fixedbolditalic</dt>
<dd>
Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width font. Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to &quot;CB&quot;.  Some systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as &quot;CX&quot;.  Only matters for  <b>troff</b> output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
name</dt>
<dd>
Set the name of the manual page.  Without this option, the manual name is set to the uppercased base name of the file being converted unless the manual section is 3, in which case the path is parsed to see if it is a Perl module path.  If it is, a path like &quot;.../lib/Pod/Man.pm&quot; is converted into a name like &quot;Pod::Man&quot;.  This option, if given, overrides any automatic determination of the name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
quotes</dt>
<dd>
Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text.  If the value is a single character, it is used as both the left and right quote; if it is two characters, the first character is used as the left quote and the second as the right quoted; and if it is four characters, the first two are used as the left quote and the second two as the right quote.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This may also be set to the special value &quot;none&quot;, in which case no quote marks are added around C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed for troff output).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
release</dt>
<dd>
Set the centered footer.  By default, this is the version of Perl you run Pod::Man under.  Note that some system an macro sets assume that the centered footer will be a modification date and will prepend something like &quot;Last modified: &quot;; if this is the case, you may want to set &quot;release&quot; to the last modified date and &quot;date&quot; to the version number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
section</dt>
<dd>
Set the section for the &quot;.TH&quot; macro.  The standard section numbering convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There is a lot of variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file formats, 5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices.  Still others use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.  About the only section numbers that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in &quot;.pm&quot; in which case section 3 will be selected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
stderr</dt>
<dd>
Send error messages about invalid POD to standard error instead of appending a POD ERRORS section to the generated *roff output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
utf8</dt>
<dd>
By default, Pod::Man produces the most conservative possible *roff output to try to ensure that it will work with as many different *roff implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations cannot handle non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII characters are converted either to a *roff escape sequence that tries to create a properly accented character (at least for troff output) or to &quot;X&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If this option is set, Pod::Man will instead output UTF-8.  If your *roff implementation can handle it, this is the best output format to use and avoids corruption of documents containing non-ASCII characters.  However, be warned that *roff source with literal UTF-8 characters is not supported by many implementations and may even result in segfaults and other bad behavior.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your POD source must be properly declared unless it is US-ASCII or Latin-1.  POD input without an &quot;=encoding&quot; command will be assumed to be in Latin-1, and if it's actually in UTF-8, the output will be double-encoded.  See  <i>perlpod</i>(1) for more information on the &quot;=encoding&quot; command.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The standard Pod::Simple method <i>parse_file()</i> takes one argument naming the POD file to read from.  By default, the output is sent to &quot;STDOUT&quot;, but this can be changed with the  <i>output_fd()</i> method.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The standard Pod::Simple method <i>parse_from_file()</i> takes up to two arguments, the first being the input file to read POD from and the second being the file to write the formatted output to.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can also call <i>parse_lines()</i> to parse an array of lines or  <i>parse_string_document()</i> to parse a document already in memory.  To put the output into a string instead of a file handle, call the  <i>output_string()</i> method.  See Pod::Simple for the specific details.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1><dl>
<dt>
roff font should be 1 or 2 chars, not &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) You specified a *roff font (using &quot;fixed&quot;, &quot;fixedbold&quot;, etc.) that wasn't either one or two characters.  Pod::Man doesn't support *roff fonts longer than two characters, although some *roff extensions do (the canonical versions of  <b>nroff</b> and <b>troff</b> don't either).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Invalid quote specification &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>
(F) The quote specification given (the quotes option to the constructor) was invalid.  A quote specification must be one, two, or four characters long.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS</h1> Encoding handling assumes that PerlIO is available and does not work properly if it isn't.  The &quot;utf8&quot; option is therefore not supported unless Perl is built with PerlIO support.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is currently no way to turn off the guesswork that tries to format unmarked text appropriately, and sometimes it isn't wanted (particularly when using POD to document something other than Perl).  Most of the work toward fixing this has now been done, however, and all that's still needed is a user interface.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The NAME section should be recognized specially and index entries emitted for everything in that section.  This would have to be deferred until the next section, since extraneous things in NAME tends to confuse various man page processors.  Currently, no index entries are emitted for anything in NAME.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Pod::Man doesn't handle font names longer than two characters.  Neither do most  <b>troff</b> implementations, but GNU troff does as an extension.  It would be nice to support as an option for those who want to use it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The preamble added to each output file is rather verbose, and most of it is only necessary in the presence of non-ASCII characters.  It would ideally be nice if all of those definitions were only output if needed, perhaps on the fly as the characters are used.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Pod::Man is excessively slow.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CAVEATS</h1> If Pod::Man is given the &quot;utf8&quot; option, the encoding of its output file handle will be forced to UTF-8 if possible, overriding any existing encoding.  This will be done even if the file handle is not created by Pod::Man and was passed in from outside.  This maintains consistency regardless of PERL_UNICODE and other settings.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The handling of hyphens and em dashes is somewhat fragile, and one may get the wrong one under some circumstances.  This should only matter for  <b>troff</b> output.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When and whether to use small caps is somewhat tricky, and Pod::Man doesn't necessarily get it right.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Converting neutral double quotes to properly matched double quotes doesn't work unless there are no formatting codes between the quote marks.  This only matters for troff output.</div>
