<h1>NAME</h1> exit - cause normal process termination</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
<b>void exit(int </b><i>status</i><b>);</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The <b>exit</b>() function causes normal process termination and the value of  <i>status &amp; 0377</i> is returned to the parent (see <b>wait</b>(2)).<div class="spacer">
</div>
All functions registered with <b>atexit</b>(3) and <b>on_exit</b>(3) are called, in the reverse order of their registration. (It is possible for one of these functions to use <b>atexit</b>(3) or <b>on_exit</b>(3) to register an additional function to be executed during exit processing; the new registration is added to the front of the list of functions that remain to be called.) If one of these functions does not return (e.g., it calls <b>_exit</b>(2), or kills itself with a signal), then none of the remaining functions is called, and further exit processing (in particular, flushing of <b>stdio</b>(3) streams) is abandoned. If a function has been registered multiple times using <b>atexit</b>(3) or <b>on_exit</b>(3), then it is called as many times as it was registered.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All open <b>stdio</b>(3) streams are flushed and closed. Files created by <b>tmpfile</b>(3) are removed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The C standard specifies two constants,  <b>EXIT_SUCCESS</b> and <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>, that may be passed to <b>exit</b>() to indicate successful or unsuccessful termination, respectively.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> The <b>exit</b>() function does not return.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001, C89, C99.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> It is undefined what happens if one of the functions registered using <b>atexit</b>(3) and <b>on_exit</b>(3) calls either <b>exit</b>() or <b>longjmp</b>(3).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The use of <b>EXIT_SUCCESS</b> and <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b> is slightly more portable (to non-UNIX environments) than the use of 0 and some nonzero value like 1 or -1. In particular, VMS uses a different convention.<div class="spacer">
</div>
BSD has attempted to standardize exit codes; see the file <i>&lt;sysexits.h&gt;</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
After <b>exit</b>(), the exit status must be transmitted to the parent process. There are three cases. If the parent has set <b>SA_NOCLDWAIT</b>, or has set the <b>SIGCHLD</b> handler to <b>SIG_IGN</b>, the status is discarded. If the parent was waiting on the child it is notified of the exit status. In both cases the exiting process dies immediately. If the parent has not indicated that it is not interested in the exit status, but is not waiting, the exiting process turns into a &quot;zombie&quot; process (which is nothing but a container for the single byte representing the exit status) so that the parent can learn the exit status when it later calls one of the <b>wait</b>(2) functions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the implementation supports the <b>SIGCHLD</b> signal, this signal is sent to the parent. If the parent has set <b>SA_NOCLDWAIT</b>, it is undefined whether a <b>SIGCHLD</b> signal is sent.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the process is a session leader and its controlling terminal is the controlling terminal of the session, then each process in the foreground process group of this controlling terminal is sent a <b>SIGHUP</b> signal, and the terminal is disassociated from this session, allowing it to be acquired by a new controlling process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the exit of the process causes a process group to become orphaned, and if any member of the newly orphaned process group is stopped, then a <b>SIGHUP</b> signal followed by a <b>SIGCONT</b> signal will be sent to each process in this process group. See <b>setpgid</b>(2) for an explanation of orphaned process groups.</div>
