<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The concept of roles is documented in Moose::Manual::Roles. This document serves as API documentation.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXPORTED FUNCTIONS</h1> Moose::Role currently supports all of the functions that Moose exports, but differs slightly in how some items are handled (see &quot;CAVEATS&quot; below for details).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Moose::Role also offers two role-specific keyword exports:<dl>
<dt>
<b>requires (@method_names)</b></dt>
<dd>
Roles can require that certain methods are implemented by any class which &quot;does&quot; the role.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that attribute accessors also count as methods for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of a role.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>excludes (@role_names)</b></dt>
<dd>
Roles can &quot;exclude&quot; other roles, in effect saying &quot;I can never be combined with these @role_names&quot;. This is a feature which should not be used lightly.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="subsection">
<h2><b>unimport</b></h2> Moose::Role offers a way to remove the keywords it exports, through the &quot;unimport&quot; method. You simply have to say &quot;no Moose::Role&quot; at the bottom of your code for this to work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>METACLASS</h1> When you use Moose::Role, you can specify traits which will be applied to your role metaclass:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    use Moose::Role -traits =&gt; 'My::Trait';<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is very similar to the attribute traits feature. When you do this, your class's &quot;meta&quot; object will have the specified traits applied to it. See &quot;Metaclass and Trait Name Resolution&quot; in Moose for more details.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLYING ROLES</h1> In addition to being applied to a class using the 'with' syntax (see Moose::Manual::Roles) and using the Moose::Util 'apply_all_roles' method, roles may also be applied to an instance of a class using Moose::Util 'apply_all_roles' or the role's metaclass:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
   MyApp::Test::SomeRole-&gt;meta-&gt;apply( $instance );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Doing this creates a new, mutable, anonymous subclass, applies the role to that, and reblesses. In a debugger, for example, you will see class names of the form &quot; Moose::Meta::Class::__ANON__::SERIAL::6 &quot;, which means that doing a 'ref' on your instance may not return what you expect. See Moose::Object for 'DOES'.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Additional params may be added to the new instance by providing 'rebless_params'. See Moose::Meta::Role::Application::ToInstance.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CAVEATS</h1> Role support has only a few caveats:<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Roles cannot use the &quot;extends&quot; keyword; it will throw an exception for now. The same is true of the &quot;augment&quot; and &quot;inner&quot; keywords (not sure those really make sense for roles). All other Moose keywords will be  <i>deferred</i> so that they can be applied to the consuming class.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
&#8226;</dt>
<dd>
Role composition does its best to <b>not</b> be order-sensitive when it comes to conflict resolution and requirements detection. However, it is order-sensitive when it comes to method modifiers. All before/around/after modifiers are included whenever a role is composed into a class, and then applied in the order in which the roles are used. This also means that there is no conflict for before/around/after modifiers.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In most cases, this will be a non-issue; however, it is something to keep in mind when using method modifiers in a role. You should never assume any ordering.</dd>
