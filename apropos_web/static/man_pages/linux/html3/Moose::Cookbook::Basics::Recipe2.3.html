<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The first recipe demonstrated how to build very basic Moose classes, focusing on creating and manipulating attributes. The objects in that recipe were very data-oriented, and did not have much in the way of behavior (i.e. methods). In this recipe, we expand upon the concepts from the first recipe to include some real behavior. In particular, we show how you can use a method modifier to implement new behavior for a method.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The classes in the SYNOPSIS show two kinds of bank account. A simple bank account has one attribute, the balance, and two behaviors, depositing and withdrawing money.<div class="spacer">
</div>
We then extend the basic bank account in the CheckingAccount class. This class adds another attribute, an overdraft account. It also adds overdraft protection to the withdraw method. If you try to withdraw more than you have, the checking account attempts to reconcile the difference by withdrawing money from the overdraft account. (1)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first class, <b>BankAccount</b>, introduces a new attribute feature, a default value:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  has 'balance' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Int', is =&gt; 'rw', default =&gt; 0 );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This says that a <b>BankAccount</b> has a &quot;balance&quot; attribute, which has an &quot;Int&quot; type constraint, a read/write accessor, and a default value of 0. This means that every instance of  <b>BankAccount</b> that is created will have its &quot;balance&quot; slot initialized to 0, unless some other value is provided to the constructor.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;deposit&quot; and &quot;withdraw&quot; methods should be fairly self-explanatory, as they are just plain old Perl 5 OO. (2)<div class="spacer">
</div>
As you know from the first recipe, the keyword &quot;extends&quot; sets a class's superclass. Here we see that  <b>CheckingAccount</b> &quot;extends&quot;  <b>BankAccount</b>. The next line introduces yet another new attribute feature, class-based type constraints:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  has 'overdraft_account' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'BankAccount', is =&gt; 'rw' );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Up until now, we have only seen the &quot;Int&quot; type constraint, which (as we saw in the first recipe) is a builtin type constraint. The &quot;BankAccount&quot; type constraint is new, and was actually defined the moment we created the  <b>BankAccount</b> class itself. In fact, Moose creates a corresponding type constraint for every class in your program (3).<div class="spacer">
</div>
This means that in the first recipe, constraints for both &quot;Point&quot; and &quot;Point3D&quot; were created. In this recipe, both &quot;BankAccount&quot; and &quot;CheckingAccount&quot; type constraints are created automatically. Moose does this as a convenience so that your classes and type constraint can be kept in sync with one another. In short, Moose makes sure that it will just DWIM (4).<div class="spacer">
</div>
In <b>CheckingAccount</b>, we see another method modifier, the &quot;before&quot; modifier.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  before 'withdraw' =&gt; sub {<br/>
      my ( $self, $amount ) = @_;<br/>
      my $overdraft_amount = $amount - $self-&gt;balance();<br/>
      if ( $self-&gt;overdraft_account &amp;&amp; $overdraft_amount &gt; 0 ) {<br/>
          $self-&gt;overdraft_account-&gt;withdraw($overdraft_amount);<br/>
          $self-&gt;deposit($overdraft_amount);<br/>
      }<br/>
  };<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Just as with the &quot;after&quot; modifier from the first recipe, Moose will handle calling the superclass method (in this case &quot;BankAccount-&gt;withdraw&quot;).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The &quot;before&quot; modifier will (obviously) run <i>before</i> the code from the superclass is run. Here, &quot;before&quot; modifier implements overdraft protection by first checking if there are available funds in the checking account. If not (and if there is an overdraft account available), it transfers the amount needed into the checking account (5).<div class="spacer">
</div>
As with the method modifier in the first recipe, we could use &quot;SUPER::&quot; to get the same effect:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  sub withdraw {<br/>
      my ( $self, $amount ) = @_;<br/>
      my $overdraft_amount = $amount - $self-&gt;balance();<br/>
      if ( $self-&gt;overdraft_account &amp;&amp; $overdraft_amount &gt; 0 ) {<br/>
          $self-&gt;overdraft_account-&gt;withdraw($overdraft_amount);<br/>
          $self-&gt;deposit($overdraft_amount);<br/>
      }<br/>
      $self-&gt;SUPER::withdraw($amount);<br/>
  }<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The benefit of taking the method modifier approach is we do not need to remember to call &quot;SUPER::withdraw&quot; and pass it the $amount argument when writing &quot;CheckingAccount-&gt;withdraw&quot;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is actually more than just a convenience for forgetful programmers. Using method modifiers helps isolate subclasses from changes in the superclasses. For instance, if  <b>BankAccount-&gt;withdraw</b> were to add an additional argument of some kind, the version of  <b>CheckingAccount-&gt;withdraw</b> which uses &quot;SUPER::withdraw&quot; would not pass that extra argument correctly, whereas the method modifier version would automatically pass along all arguments correctly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Just as with the first recipe, object instantiation uses the &quot;new&quot; method, which accepts named parameters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  my $savings_account = BankAccount-&gt;new( balance =&gt; 250 );<br/>
<br/>
  my $checking_account = CheckingAccount-&gt;new(<br/>
      balance           =&gt; 100,<br/>
      overdraft_account =&gt; $savings_account,<br/>
  );<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
And as with the first recipe, a more in-depth example can be found in the  <i>t/recipes/moose_cookbook_basics_recipe2.t</i> test file.</div>

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1> This recipe expanded on the basic concepts from the first recipe with a more &quot;real world&quot; use case.</div>

<h1>FOOTNOTES</h1><dl>
<dt>
(1)</dt>
<dd>
If you're paying close attention, you might realize that there's a circular loop waiting to happen here. A smarter example would have to make sure that we don't accidentally create a loop between the checking account and its overdraft account.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
(2)</dt>
<dd>
Note that for simple methods like these, which just manipulate some single piece of data, it is often not necessary to write them at all. For instance, &quot;deposit&quot; could be implemented via the &quot;inc&quot; native delegation for counters - see Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::Trait::Counter for more specifics, and Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native for a broader overview.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

<dd>
In reality, this creation is sensitive to the order in which modules are loaded. In more complicated cases, you may find that you need to explicitly declare a class type before the corresponding class is loaded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
(4)</dt>
<dd>
Moose does not attempt to encode a class's is-a relationships within the type constraint hierarchy. Instead, Moose just considers the class type constraint to be a subtype of &quot;Object&quot;, and specializes the constraint check to allow for subclasses. This means that an instance of  <b>CheckingAccount</b> will pass a &quot;BankAccount&quot; type constraint successfully. For more details, please refer to the Moose::Util::TypeConstraints documentation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
(5)</dt>
<dd>
If the overdraft account does not have the amount needed, it will throw an error. Of course, the overdraft account could also have overdraft protection. See note 1.</dd>
