When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a  <i>GraphicsExpose</i> event to a client application, it sends an  <i>XGraphicsExposeEvent</i> structure with the type member set to  <i>GraphicsExpose</i>. The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set to  <i>True</i> if the event came from a  <i>SendEvent</i> protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The parent member is set to the created window's parent. The window member specifies the created window. The x and y members are set to the created window's coordinates relative to the parent window's origin and indicate the position of the upper-left outside corner of the created window. The width and height members are set to the inside size of the created window (not including the border) and are always nonzero. The border_width member is set to the width of the created window's border, in pixels. The override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect attribute of the window. Window manager clients normally should ignore this window if the override_redirect member is  <i>True</i>.</div>
