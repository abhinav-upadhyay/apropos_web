<h1>NAME</h1> credentials - process identifiers</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1><div class="subsection">
<h2>Process ID (PID)</h2> Each process has a unique nonnegative integer identifier that is assigned when the process is created using <b>fork</b>(2). A process can obtain its PID using <b>getpid</b>(2). A PID is represented using the type <i>pid_t</i> (defined in <i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i>).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
PIDs are used in a range of system calls to identify the process affected by the call, for example: <b>kill</b>(2), <b>ptrace</b>(2), <b>setpriority</b>(2) <b>setpgid</b>(2), <b>setsid</b>(2), <b>sigqueue</b>(3), and <b>waitpid</b>(2).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A process's PID is preserved across an <b>execve</b>(2).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Parent Process ID (PPID)</h2> A process's parent process ID identifies the process that created this process using <b>fork</b>(2). A process can obtain its PPID using <b>getppid</b>(2). A PPID is represented using the type <i>pid_t</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A process's PPID is preserved across an <b>execve</b>(2).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Process Group ID and Session ID</h2> Each process has a session ID and a process group ID, both represented using the type <i>pid_t</i>. A process can obtain its session ID using <b>getsid</b>(2), and its process group ID using <b>getpgrp</b>(2).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A child created by <b>fork</b>(2) inherits its parent's session ID and process group ID. A process's session ID and process group ID are preserved across an <b>execve</b>(2).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Sessions and process groups are abstractions devised to support shell job control. A process group (sometimes called a &quot;job&quot;) is a collection of processes that share the same process group ID; the shell creates a new process group for the process(es) used to execute single command or pipeline (e.g., the two processes created to execute the command &quot;ls&#160;|&#160;wc&quot; are placed in the same process group). A process's group membership can be set using <b>setpgid</b>(2). The process whose process ID is the same as its process group ID is the  <i>process group leader</i> for that group.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A session is a collection of processes that share the same session ID. All of the members of a process group also have the same session ID (i.e., all of the members of a process group always belong to the same session, so that sessions and process groups form a strict two-level hierarchy of processes.) A new session is created when a process calls <b>setsid</b>(2), which creates a new session whose session ID is the same as the PID of the process that called <b>setsid</b>(2). The creator of the session is called the  <i>session leader</i>.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>User and Group Identifiers</h2> Each process has various associated user and groups IDs. These IDs are integers, respectively represented using the types <i>uid_t</i> and <i>gid_t</i> (defined in <i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i>).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On Linux, each process has the following user and group identifiers:<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
Real user ID and real group ID. These IDs determine who owns the process. A process can obtain its real user (group) ID using <b>getuid</b>(2) (<b>getgid</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
Effective user ID and effective group ID. These IDs are used by the kernel to determine the permissions that the process will have when accessing shared resources such as message queues, shared memory, and semaphores. On most UNIX systems, these IDs also determine the permissions when accessing files. However, Linux uses the file system IDs described below for this task. A process can obtain its effective user (group) ID using <b>geteuid</b>(2) (<b>getegid</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
Saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID. These IDs are used in set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs to save a copy of the corresponding effective IDs that were set when the program was executed (see <b>execve</b>(2)). A set-user-ID program can assume and drop privileges by switching its effective user ID back and forth between the values in its real user ID and saved set-user-ID. This switching is done via calls to <b>seteuid</b>(2), <b>setreuid</b>(2), or <b>setresuid</b>(2). A set-group-ID program performs the analogous tasks using <b>setegid</b>(2), <b>setregid</b>(2), or <b>setresgid</b>(2). A process can obtain its saved set-user-ID (set-group-ID) using <b>getresuid</b>(2) (<b>getresgid</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
File system user ID and file system group ID (Linux-specific). These IDs, in conjunction with the supplementary group IDs described below, are used to determine permissions for accessing files; see <b>path_resolution</b>(7) for details. Whenever a process's effective user (group) ID is changed, the kernel also automatically changes the file system user (group) ID to the same value. Consequently, the file system IDs normally have the same values as the corresponding effective ID, and the semantics for file-permission checks are thus the same on Linux as on other UNIX systems. The file system IDs can be made to differ from the effective IDs by calling <b>setfsuid</b>(2) and <b>setfsgid</b>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
Supplementary group IDs. This is a set of additional group IDs that are used for permission checks when accessing files and other shared resources. On Linux kernels before 2.6.4, a process can be a member of up to 32 supplementary groups; since kernel 2.6.4, a process can be a member of up to 65536 supplementary groups. The call <i>sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX)</i> can be used to determine the number of supplementary groups of which a process may be a member. A process can obtain its set of supplementary group IDs using <b>getgroups</b>(2), and can modify the set using <b>setgroups</b>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
A child process created by <b>fork</b>(2) inherits copies of its parent's user and groups IDs. During an <b>execve</b>(2), a process's real user and group ID and supplementary group IDs are preserved; the effective and saved set IDs may be changed, as described in <b>execve</b>(2).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Aside from the purposes noted above, a process's user IDs are also employed in a number of other contexts:<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
when determining the permissions for sending signals&#8212;see <b>kill</b>(2);</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
when determining the permissions for setting process-scheduling parameters (nice value, real time scheduling policy and priority, CPU affinity, I/O priority) using <b>setpriority</b>(2), <b>sched_setaffinity</b>(2), <b>sched_setscheduler</b>(2), <b>sched_setparam</b>(2), and <b>ioprio_set</b>(2);</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
when checking resource limits; see <b>getrlimit</b>(2);</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
when checking the limit on the number of inotify instances that the process may create; see <b>inotify</b>(7).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> Process IDs, parent process IDs, process group IDs, and session IDs are specified in POSIX.1-2001. The real, effective, and saved set user and groups IDs, and the supplementary group IDs, are specified in POSIX.1-2001. The file system user and group IDs are a Linux extension.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> The POSIX threads specification requires that credentials are shared by all of the threads in a process. However, at the kernel level, Linux maintains separate user and group credentials for each thread. The NPTL threading implementation does some work to ensure that any change to user or group credentials (e.g., calls to <b>setuid</b>(2), <b>setresuid</b>(2), etc.) is carried through to all of the POSIX threads in a process.</div>
