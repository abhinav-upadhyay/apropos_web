The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware membership corporation.  It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the MIT X Consortium.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to support further development of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and the membership decided it was in their best interests to move the consortium out of MIT and create an independent, stand-alone organization. All rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, Inc. on January 1, 1994.  On December 31, 1996 the X Consortium, Inc. closed its doors and all rights to the X Window System were assigned to The Open Group.</div>
