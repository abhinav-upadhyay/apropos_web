<h1>NAME</h1> capabilities - overview of Linux capabilities</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> For the purpose of performing permission checks, traditional UNIX implementations distinguish two categories of processes: <i>privileged</i> processes (whose effective user ID is 0, referred to as superuser or root), and <i>unprivileged</i> processes (whose effective UID is nonzero). Privileged processes bypass all kernel permission checks, while unprivileged processes are subject to full permission checking based on the process's credentials (usually: effective UID, effective GID, and supplementary group list).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Starting with kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into distinct units, known as <i>capabilities</i>, which can be independently enabled and disabled. Capabilities are a per-thread attribute.<div class="subsection">

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Past and Current Implementation</h2> A full implementation of capabilities requires that:<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>
<dd>
For all privileged operations, the kernel must check whether the thread has the required capability in its effective set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2.</dt>
<dd>
The kernel must provide system calls allowing a thread's capability sets to be changed and retrieved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
3.</dt>
<dd>
The file system must support attaching capabilities to an executable file, so that a process gains those capabilities when the file is executed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Before kernel 2.6.24, only the first two of these requirements are met; since kernel 2.6.24, all three requirements are met.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Thread Capability Sets</h2> Each thread has three capability sets containing zero or more of the above capabilities:<dl>
<dt>
<i>Permitted</i>:</dt>
<dd>
This is a limiting superset for the effective capabilities that the thread may assume. It is also a limiting superset for the capabilities that may be added to the inheritable set by a thread that does not have the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> capability in its effective set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If a thread drops a capability from its permitted set, it can never reacquire that capability (unless it <b>execve</b>(2)s either a set-user-ID-root program, or a program whose associated file capabilities grant that capability).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>Inheritable</i>:</dt>
<dd>
This is a set of capabilities preserved across an <b>execve</b>(2). It provides a mechanism for a process to assign capabilities to the permitted set of the new program during an <b>execve</b>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>Effective</i>:</dt>
<dd>
This is the set of capabilities used by the kernel to perform permission checks for the thread.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
A child created via <b>fork</b>(2) inherits copies of its parent's capability sets. See below for a discussion of the treatment of capabilities during <b>execve</b>(2).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Using <b>capset</b>(2), a thread may manipulate its own capability sets (see below).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>File Capabilities</h2> Since kernel 2.6.24, the kernel supports associating capability sets with an executable file using <b>setcap</b>(8). The file capability sets are stored in an extended attribute (see <b>setxattr</b>(2)) named <i>security.capability</i>. Writing to this extended attribute requires the <b>CAP_SETFCAP</b> capability. The file capability sets, in conjunction with the capability sets of the thread, determine the capabilities of a thread after an <b>execve</b>(2).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The three file capability sets are:<dl>
<dt>
<i>Permitted</i> (formerly known as <i>forced</i>):</dt>
<dd>
These capabilities are automatically permitted to the thread, regardless of the thread's inheritable capabilities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>Inheritable</i> (formerly known as <i>allowed</i>):</dt>
<dd>
This set is ANDed with the thread's inheritable set to determine which inheritable capabilities are enabled in the permitted set of the thread after the <b>execve</b>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>Effective</i>:</dt>
<dd>
This is not a set, but rather just a single bit. If this bit is set, then during an <b>execve</b>(2) all of the new permitted capabilities for the thread are also raised in the effective set. If this bit is not set, then after an <b>execve</b>(2), none of the new permitted capabilities is in the new effective set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Enabling the file effective capability bit implies that any file permitted or inheritable capability that causes a thread to acquire the corresponding permitted capability during an <b>execve</b>(2) (see the transformation rules described below) will also acquire that capability in its effective set. Therefore, when assigning capabilities to a file (<b>setcap</b>(8), <b>cap_set_file</b>(3), <b>cap_set_fd</b>(3)), if we specify the effective flag as being enabled for any capability, then the effective flag must also be specified as enabled for all other capabilities for which the corresponding permitted or inheritable flags is enabled.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Transformation of Capabilities During execve()</h2> During an <b>execve</b>(2), the kernel calculates the new capabilities of the process using the following algorithm:<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
P'(permitted) = (P(inheritable) &amp; F(inheritable)) |<br/>
                (F(permitted) &amp; cap_bset)<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
P'(effective) = F(effective) ? P'(permitted) : 0<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
P'(inheritable) = P(inheritable)    [i.e., unchanged]<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
where:<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
P</dt>
<dd>
denotes the value of a thread capability set before the <b>execve</b>(2)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
P'</dt>
<dd>
denotes the value of a capability set after the <b>execve</b>(2)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
F</dt>
<dd>
denotes a file capability set</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
cap_bset</dt>
<dd>
is the value of the capability bounding set (described below).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Capabilities and execution of programs by root</h2> In order to provide an all-powerful <i>root</i> using capability sets, during an <b>execve</b>(2):<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>
<dd>
If a set-user-ID-root program is being executed, or the real user ID of the process is 0 (root) then the file inheritable and permitted sets are defined to be all ones (i.e., all capabilities enabled).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2.</dt>
<dd>
If a set-user-ID-root program is being executed, then the file effective bit is defined to be one (enabled).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The upshot of the above rules, combined with the capabilities transformations described above, is that when a process <b>execve</b>(2)s a set-user-ID-root program, or when a process with an effective UID of 0 <b>execve</b>(2)s a program, it gains all capabilities in its permitted and effective capability sets, except those masked out by the capability bounding set. This provides semantics that are the same as those provided by traditional UNIX systems.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Capability bounding set</h2> The capability bounding set is a security mechanism that can be used to limit the capabilities that can be gained during an <b>execve</b>(2). The bounding set is used in the following ways:<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
During an <b>execve</b>(2), the capability bounding set is ANDed with the file permitted capability set, and the result of this operation is assigned to the thread's permitted capability set. The capability bounding set thus places a limit on the permitted capabilities that may be granted by an executable file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
(Since Linux 2.6.25) The capability bounding set acts as a limiting superset for the capabilities that a thread can add to its inheritable set using <b>capset</b>(2). This means that if a capability is not in the bounding set, then a thread can't add this capability to its inheritable set, even if it was in its permitted capabilities, and thereby cannot have this capability preserved in its permitted set when it <b>execve</b>(2)s a file that has the capability in its inheritable set.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that the bounding set masks the file permitted capabilities, but not the inherited capabilities. If a thread maintains a capability in its inherited set that is not in its bounding set, then it can still gain that capability in its permitted set by executing a file that has the capability in its inherited set.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Depending on the kernel version, the capability bounding set is either a system-wide attribute, or a per-process attribute.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Capability bounding set prior to Linux 2.6.25</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
In kernels before 2.6.25, the capability bounding set is a system-wide attribute that affects all threads on the system. The bounding set is accessible via the file <i>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</i>. (Confusingly, this bit mask parameter is expressed as a signed decimal number in <i>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</i>.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Only the <b>init</b> process may set capabilities in the capability bounding set; other than that, the superuser (more precisely: programs with the <b>CAP_SYS_MODULE</b> capability) may only clear capabilities from this set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On a standard system the capability bounding set always masks out the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> capability. To remove this restriction (dangerous!), modify the definition of <b>CAP_INIT_EFF_SET</b> in <i>include/linux/capability.h</i> and rebuild the kernel.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The system-wide capability bounding set feature was added to Linux starting with kernel version 2.2.11.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Capability bounding set from Linux 2.6.25 onward</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
From Linux 2.6.25, the <i>capability bounding set</i> is a per-thread attribute. (There is no longer a system-wide capability bounding set.)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The bounding set is inherited at <b>fork</b>(2) from the thread's parent, and is preserved across an <b>execve</b>(2).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A thread may remove capabilities from its capability bounding set using the <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_CAPBSET_DROP</b> operation, provided it has the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> capability. Once a capability has been dropped from the bounding set, it cannot be restored to that set. A thread can determine if a capability is in its bounding set using the <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_CAPBSET_READ</b> operation.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Removing capabilities from the bounding set is only supported if file capabilities are compiled into the kernel. In kernels before Linux 2.6.33, file capabilities were an optional feature configurable via the CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES option. Since Linux 2.6.33, the configuration option has been removed and file capabilities are always part of the kernel. When file capabilities are compiled into the kernel, the <b>init</b> process (the ancestor of all processes) begins with a full bounding set. If file capabilities are not compiled into the kernel, then <b>init</b> begins with a full bounding set minus <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b>, because this capability has a different meaning when there are no file capabilities.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Removing a capability from the bounding set does not remove it from the thread's inherited set. However it does prevent the capability from being added back into the thread's inherited set in the future.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Effect of User ID Changes on Capabilities</h2> To preserve the traditional semantics for transitions between 0 and nonzero user IDs, the kernel makes the following changes to a thread's capability sets on changes to the thread's real, effective, saved set, and file system user IDs (using <b>setuid</b>(2), <b>setresuid</b>(2), or similar):<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>
<dd>
If one or more of the real, effective or saved set user IDs was previously 0, and as a result of the UID changes all of these IDs have a nonzero value, then all capabilities are cleared from the permitted and effective capability sets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2.</dt>
<dd>
If the effective user ID is changed from 0 to nonzero, then all capabilities are cleared from the effective set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
3.</dt>
<dd>
If the effective user ID is changed from nonzero to 0, then the permitted set is copied to the effective set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
4.</dt>
<dd>
If the file system user ID is changed from 0 to nonzero (see <b>setfsuid</b>(2)) then the following capabilities are cleared from the effective set: <b>CAP_CHOWN</b>, <b>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</b>, <b>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</b>, <b>CAP_FOWNER</b>, <b>CAP_FSETID</b>, <b>CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</b> (since Linux 2.2.30), <b>CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE</b>, and <b>CAP_MKNOD</b> (since Linux 2.2.30). If the file system UID is changed from nonzero to 0, then any of these capabilities that are enabled in the permitted set are enabled in the effective set.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a thread that has a 0 value for one or more of its user IDs wants to prevent its permitted capability set being cleared when it resets all of its user IDs to nonzero values, it can do so using the <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS</b> operation.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Programmatically adjusting capability sets</h2> A thread can retrieve and change its capability sets using the <b>capget</b>(2) and <b>capset</b>(2) system calls. However, the use of <b>cap_get_proc</b>(3) and <b>cap_set_proc</b>(3), both provided in the <i>libcap</i> package, is preferred for this purpose. The following rules govern changes to the thread capability sets:<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>
<dd>
If the caller does not have the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> capability, the new inheritable set must be a subset of the combination of the existing inheritable and permitted sets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
2.</dt>
<dd>
(Since kernel 2.6.25) The new inheritable set must be a subset of the combination of the existing inheritable set and the capability bounding set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
3.</dt>
<dd>
The new permitted set must be a subset of the existing permitted set (i.e., it is not possible to acquire permitted capabilities that the thread does not currently have).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
4.</dt>
<dd>
The new effective set must be a subset of the new permitted set.</dd>

<h2>The &quot;securebits&quot; flags: establishing a capabilities-only environment</h2> Starting with kernel 2.6.26, and with a kernel in which file capabilities are enabled, Linux implements a set of per-thread <i>securebits</i> flags that can be used to disable special handling of capabilities for UID 0 (<i>root</i>). These flags are as follows:<dl>
<dt>
<b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS</b></dt>
<dd>
Setting this flag allows a thread that has one or more 0 UIDs to retain its capabilities when it switches all of its UIDs to a nonzero value. If this flag is not set, then such a UID switch causes the thread to lose all capabilities. This flag is always cleared on an <b>execve</b>(2). (This flag provides the same functionality as the older <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS</b> operation.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP</b></dt>
<dd>
Setting this flag stops the kernel from adjusting capability sets when the threads's effective and file system UIDs are switched between zero and nonzero values. (See the subsection <i>Effect of User ID Changes on Capabilities</i>.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>SECBIT_NOROOT</b></dt>
<dd>
If this bit is set, then the kernel does not grant capabilities when a set-user-ID-root program is executed, or when a process with an effective or real UID of 0 calls <b>execve</b>(2). (See the subsection <i>Capabilities and execution of programs by root</i>.)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each of the above &quot;base&quot; flags has a companion &quot;locked&quot; flag. Setting any of the &quot;locked&quot; flags is irreversible, and has the effect of preventing further changes to the corresponding &quot;base&quot; flag. The locked flags are: <b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED</b>, <b>SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED</b>, and <b>SECBIT_NOROOT_LOCKED</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>securebits</i> flags can be modified and retrieved using the <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_SECUREBITS</b> and <b>PR_GET_SECUREBITS</b> operations. The <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> capability is required to modify the flags.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <i>securebits</i> flags are inherited by child processes. During an <b>execve</b>(2), all of the flags are preserved, except <b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS</b> which is always cleared.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
An application can use the following call to lock itself, and all of its descendants, into an environment where the only way of gaining capabilities is by executing a program with associated file capabilities:<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
prctl(PR_SET_SECUREBITS,<br/>
        SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED |<br/>
        SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP |<br/>
        SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED |<br/>
        SECBIT_NOROOT |<br/>
        SECBIT_NOROOT_LOCKED);<br/>
<br/>

<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> No standards govern capabilities, but the Linux capability implementation is based on the withdrawn POSIX.1e draft standard; see <i>http://wt.xpilot.org/publications/posix.1e/</i>.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> Since kernel 2.5.27, capabilities are an optional kernel component, and can be enabled/disabled via the CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES kernel configuration option.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <i>/proc/PID/task/TID/status</i> file can be used to view the capability sets of a thread. The <i>/proc/PID/status</i> file shows the capability sets of a process's main thread.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The <i>libcap</i> package provides a suite of routines for setting and getting capabilities that is more comfortable and less likely to change than the interface provided by <b>capset</b>(2) and <b>capget</b>(2). This package also provides the <b>setcap</b>(8) and <b>getcap</b>(8) programs. It can be found at<div style="height: 0.00em;">

&#160;</div>
Before kernel 2.6.24, and since kernel 2.6.24 if file capabilities are not enabled, a thread with the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> capability can manipulate the capabilities of threads other than itself. However, this is only theoretically possible, since no thread ever has <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> in either of these cases:<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
In the pre-2.6.25 implementation the system-wide capability bounding set, <i>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</i>, always masks out this capability, and this can not be changed without modifying the kernel source and rebuilding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
If file capabilities are disabled in the current implementation, then <b>init</b> starts out with this capability removed from its per-process bounding set, and that bounding set is inherited by all other processes created on the system.</dd>
