<h1>NAME</h1> PAM, pam - Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This manual is intended to offer a quick introduction to  <b>Linux-PAM</b>. For more information the reader is directed to the  <b>Linux-PAM system administrators' guide</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>Linux-PAM</b> is a system of libraries that handle the authentication tasks of applications (services) on the system. The library provides a stable general interface (Application Programming Interface - API) that privilege granting programs (such as  <b>login</b>(1) and  <b>su</b>(1)) defer to to perform standard authentication tasks.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The principal feature of the PAM approach is that the nature of the authentication is dynamically configurable. In other words, the system administrator is free to choose how individual service-providing applications will authenticate users. This dynamic configuration is set by the contents of the single  <b>Linux-PAM</b> configuration file /etc/pam.conf. Alternatively, the configuration can be set by individual configuration files located in the /etc/pam.d/ directory. The presence of this directory will cause  <b>Linux-PAM</b> to  <i>ignore</i> /etc/pam.conf.<div class="spacer">
</div>
From the point of view of the system administrator, for whom this manual is provided, it is not of primary importance to understand the internal behavior of the  <b>Linux-PAM</b> library. The important point to recognize is that the configuration file(s)  <i>define</i> the connection between applications ( <b>services</b>) and the pluggable authentication modules ( <b>PAM</b>s) that perform the actual authentication tasks.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Linux-PAM</b> separates the tasks of  <i>authentication</i> into four independent management groups:  <b>account</b> management;  <b>auth</b>entication management;  <b>password</b> management; and  <b>session</b> management. (We highlight the abbreviations used for these groups in the configuration file.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Simply put, these groups take care of different aspects of a typical user's request for a restricted service:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>account</b> - provide account verification types of service: has the user's password expired?; is this user permitted access to the requested service?<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>auth</b>entication - authenticate a user and set up user credentials. Typically this is via some challenge-response request that the user must satisfy: if you are who you claim to be please enter your password. Not all authentications are of this type, there exist hardware based authentication schemes (such as the use of smart-cards and biometric devices), with suitable modules, these may be substituted seamlessly for more standard approaches to authentication - such is the flexibility of  <b>Linux-PAM</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>password</b> - this group's responsibility is the task of updating authentication mechanisms. Typically, such services are strongly coupled to those of the  <b>auth</b> group. Some authentication mechanisms lend themselves well to being updated with such a function. Standard UN*X password-based access is the obvious example: please enter a replacement password.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>session</b> - this group of tasks cover things that should be done prior to a service being given and after it is withdrawn. Such tasks include the maintenance of audit trails and the mounting of the user's home directory. The  <b>session</b> management group is important as it provides both an opening and closing hook for modules to affect the services available to a user.</div>

<h1>FILES</h1> /etc/pam.conf<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
the configuration file</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
/etc/pam.d<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
the  <b>Linux-PAM</b> configuration directory. Generally, if this directory is present, the /etc/pam.conf file is ignored.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> Typically errors generated by the  <b>Linux-PAM</b> system of libraries, will be written to  <b>syslog</b>(3).</div>

<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> DCE-RFC 86.0, October 1995. Contains additional features, but remains backwardly compatible with this RFC.</div>
