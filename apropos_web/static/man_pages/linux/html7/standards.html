<dd>
This was the successor to SVr3, released in 1989. This version of System V is described in the &quot;Programmer's Reference Manual: Operating System API (Intel processors)&quot; (Prentice-Hall 1992, ISBN 0-13-951294-2) This release was formally described in the <i>System V Interface Definition version 3</i> (<i>SVID 3</i>), and is considered the definitive System V release.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

System V Interface Definition version 4, issued in 1995. Available online at http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/ .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>C89</b></dt>
<dd>
This was the first C language standard, ratified by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) in 1989 (<i>X3.159-1989</i>). Sometimes this is known as <i>ANSI C</i>, but since C99 is also an ANSI standard, this term is ambiguous. This standard was also ratified by ISO (International Standards Organization) in 1990 (<i>ISO/IEC 9899:1990</i>), and is thus occasionally referred to as <i>ISO C90</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>C99</b></dt>
<dd>
This revision of the C language standard was ratified by ISO in 1999 (<i>ISO/IEC 9899:1999</i>). Available online at http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>POSIX.1-1990</b></dt>
<dd>
&quot;Portable Operating System Interface for Computing Environments&quot;. IEEE 1003.1-1990 part 1, ratified by ISO in 1990 (<i>ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990</i>). The term &quot;POSIX&quot; was coined by Richard Stallman.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>
A 1996 revision of POSIX.1 which incorporated POSIX.1b and POSIX.1c.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>XPG3</b></dt>
<dd>
Released in 1989, this was the first significant release of the <i>X/Open Portability Guide</i>, produced by the X/Open Company, a multivendor consortium. This multivolume guide was based on the POSIX standards.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>XPG4</b></dt>
<dd>
A revision of the X/Open Portability Guide, released in 1992.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>XPG4v2</b></dt>
<dd>
A 1994 revision of XPG4. This is also referred to as <i>Spec 1170</i>, where 1170 referred to the number of interfaces defined by this standard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>SUS (SUSv1)</b></dt>
<dd>
Single UNIX Specification. This was a repackaging of XPG4v2 and other X/Open standards (X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2, X/Open Networking Service (XNS) Issue 4). Systems conforming to this standard can be branded <i>UNIX 95</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>SUSv2</b></dt>
<dd>
Single UNIX Specification version 2. Sometimes also referred to as <i>XPG5</i>. This standard appeared in 1997. Systems conforming to this standard can be branded <i>UNIX 98</i>. See also http://www.UNIX-systems.org/version2/ .)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>POSIX.1-2001, SUSv3</b></dt>
<dd>
This was a 2001 revision and consolidation of the POSIX.1, POSIX.2, and SUS standards into a single document, conducted under the auspices of the Austin group (http://www.opengroup.org/austin/ .) The standard is available online at http://www.unix-systems.org/version3/ , and the interfaces that it describes are also available in the Linux manual pages package under sections 1p and 3p (e.g., &quot;man 3p open&quot;).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The standard defines two levels of conformance: <i>POSIX conformance</i>, which is a baseline set of interfaces required of a conforming system; and <i>XSI Conformance</i>, which additionally mandates a set of interfaces (the &quot;XSI extension&quot;) which are only optional for POSIX conformance. XSI-conformant systems can be branded <i>UNIX 03</i>. (XSI conformance constitutes the <i>Single UNIX Specification version 3</i> (<i>SUSv3</i>).)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The POSIX.1-2001 document is broken into four parts:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>XBD</b>: Definitions, terms and concepts, header file specifications.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>XSH</b>: Specifications of functions (i.e., system calls and library functions in actual implementations).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>XCU</b>: Specifications of commands and utilities (i.e., the area formerly described by POSIX.2).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>XRAT</b>: Informative text on the other parts of the standard.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
POSIX.1-2001 is aligned with C99, so that all of the library functions standardized in C99 are also standardized in POSIX.1-2001.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Two Technical Corrigenda (minor fixes and improvements) of the original 2001 standard have occurred: TC1 in 2003 (referred to as <i>POSIX.1-2003</i>), and TC2 in 2004 (referred to as <i>POSIX.1-2004</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>POSIX.1-2008, SUSv4</b></dt>
<dd>
Work on the next revision of POSIX.1/SUS was completed and ratified in 2008.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The changes in this revision are not as large as those that occurred for POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3, but a number of new interfaces are added and various details of existing specifications are modified. Many of the interfaces that were optional in POSIX.1-2001 become mandatory in the 2008 revision of the standard. A few interfaces that are present in POSIX.1-2001 are marked as obsolete in POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard altogether.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The revised standard is broken into the same four parts as POSIX.1-2001, and again there are two levels of conformance: the baseline <i>POSIX Conformance</i>, and <i>XSI Conformance</i>, which mandates an additional set of interfaces beyond those in the base specification.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In general, where the CONFORMING TO section of a manual page lists POSIX.1-2001, it can be assumed that the interface also conforms to POSIX.1-2008, unless otherwise noted.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
