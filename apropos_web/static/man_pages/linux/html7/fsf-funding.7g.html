<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <b>Funding Free Software</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage commercial redistributors to donate.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price to free software developers---the Free Software Foundation, and others.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such as, ``We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project for each disk sold.''  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as ``A portion of the profits are donated,'' since it doesn't give a basis for comparison.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Even a precise fraction ``of the profits from this disk'' is not very meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit. If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful too; but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do, and what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection contribute more; major new features or packages contribute the most.<div class="spacer">
</div>
By establishing the idea that supporting further development is ``the proper thing to do'' when distributing free software for a fee, we can assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.</div>
