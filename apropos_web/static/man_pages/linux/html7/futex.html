<h1>NAME</h1> futex - Fast Userspace Locking</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;linux/futex.h&gt;</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The Linux kernel provides futexes (&quot;Fast Userspace muTexes&quot;) as a building block for fast userspace locking and semaphores. Futexes are very basic and lend themselves well for building higher level locking abstractions such as POSIX mutexes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This page does not set out to document all design decisions but restricts itself to issues relevant for application and library development. Most programmers will in fact not be using futexes directly but instead rely on system libraries built on them, such as the NPTL pthreads implementation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A futex is identified by a piece of memory which can be shared between different processes. In these different processes, it need not have identical addresses. In its bare form, a futex has semaphore semantics; it is a counter that can be incremented and decremented atomically; processes can wait for the value to become positive.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Futex operation is entirely userspace for the noncontended case. The kernel is only involved to arbitrate the contended case. As any sane design will strive for noncontention, futexes are also optimized for this situation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In its bare form, a futex is an aligned integer which is only touched by atomic assembler instructions. Processes can share this integer using <b>mmap</b>(2), via shared memory segments or because they share memory space, in which case the application is commonly called multithreaded.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Semantics</h2> Any futex operation starts in userspace, but it may necessary to communicate with the kernel using the <b>futex</b>(2) system call.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To &quot;up&quot; a futex, execute the proper assembler instructions that will cause the host CPU to atomically increment the integer. Afterward, check if it has in fact changed from 0 to 1, in which case there were no waiters and the operation is done. This is the noncontended case which is fast and should be common.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the contended case, the atomic increment changed the counter from -1  (or some other negative number). If this is detected, there are waiters. Userspace should now set the counter to 1 and instruct the kernel to wake up any waiters using the <b>FUTEX_WAKE</b> operation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Waiting on a futex, to &quot;down&quot; it, is the reverse operation. Atomically decrement the counter and check if it changed to 0, in which case the operation is done and the futex was uncontended. In all other circumstances, the process should set the counter to -1 and request that the kernel wait for another process to up the futex. This is done using the <b>FUTEX_WAIT</b> operation.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>futex</b>(2) system call can optionally be passed a timeout specifying how long the kernel should wait for the futex to be upped. In this case, semantics are more complex and the programmer is referred to <b>futex</b>(2) for more details. The same holds for asynchronous futex waiting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>VERSIONS</h1> Initial futex support was merged in Linux 2.5.7 but with different semantics from those described above. Current semantics are available from Linux 2.5.40 onward.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> To reiterate, bare futexes are not intended as an easy to use abstraction for end-users. Implementors are expected to be assembly literate and to have read the sources of the futex userspace library referenced below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This man page illustrates the most common use of the <b>futex</b>(2) primitives: it is by no means the only one.</div>
