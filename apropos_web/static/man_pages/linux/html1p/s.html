<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>sed</i> utility is a stream editor that shall read one or more text files, make editing changes according to a script of editing commands, and write the results to standard output. The script shall be obtained from either the  <i>script</i> operand string or a combination of the option-arguments from the  <b>-e</b>  <i>script</i> and <b>-f</b> <i>script_file</i> options.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> The  <i>sed</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except that the order of presentation of the  <b>-e</b> and <b>-f</b> options is significant.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following options shall be supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-e&#160;</b> <i>script</i></dt>
<dd>
Add the editing commands specified by the <i>script</i> option-argument to the end of the script of editing commands. The  <i>script</i> option-argument shall have the same properties as the  <i>script</i> operand, described in the OPERANDS section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-f&#160;</b> <i>script_file</i></dt>
<dd>
Add the editing commands in the file <i>script_file</i> to the end of the script.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-n</b></dt>

Suppress the default output (in which each line, after it is examined for editing, is written to standard output). Only lines explicitly selected for output are written.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Multiple <b>-e</b> and <b>-f</b> options may be specified. All commands shall be added to the script in the order specified, regardless of their origin.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPERANDS</h1> The following operands shall be supported:<dl>
<dt>

A pathname of a file whose contents are read and edited. If multiple  <i>file</i> operands are specified, the named files shall be read in the order specified and the concatenation shall be edited. If no  <i>file</i> operands are specified, the standard input shall be used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>script</i></dt>
<dd>
A string to be used as the script of editing commands. The application shall not present a  <i>script</i> that violates the restrictions of a text file except that the final character need not be a &lt;newline&gt;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<h1>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h1> Default.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>STDOUT</h1> The input files shall be written to standard output, with the editing commands specified in the script applied. If the  <b>-n</b> option is specified, only those input lines selected by the script shall be written to standard output.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>STDERR</h1> The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OUTPUT FILES</h1> The output files shall be text files whose formats are dependent on the editing commands given.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>script</i> shall consist of editing commands of the following form:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>[</b><i>address</i><b>[</b><b>,</b><i>address</i><b>]]</b><i>function</i><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
where <i>function</i> represents a single-character command verb from the list in Editing Commands in sed, followed by any applicable arguments.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command can be preceded by &lt;blank&gt;s and/or semicolons. The function can be preceded by &lt;blank&gt;s. These optional characters shall have no effect.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In default operation, <i>sed</i> cyclically shall append a line of input, less its terminating &lt;newline&gt;, into the pattern space. Normally the pattern space will be empty, unless a  <b>D</b> command terminated the last cycle. The  <i>sed</i> utility shall then apply in sequence all commands whose addresses select that pattern space, and at the end of the script copy the pattern space to standard output (except when  <b>-n</b> is specified) and delete the pattern space. Whenever the pattern space is written to standard output or a named file,  <i>sed</i> shall immediately follow it with a &lt;newline&gt;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some of the editing commands use a hold space to save all or part of the pattern space for subsequent retrieval. The pattern and hold spaces shall each be able to hold at least 8192 bytes.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Addresses in sed</h2> An address is either a decimal number that counts input lines cumulatively across files, a  <b>'$'</b> character that addresses the last line of input, or a context address (which consists of a BRE, as described in Regular Expressions in sed, preceded and followed by a delimiter, usually a slash).<div class="spacer">
</div>
An editing command with no addresses shall select every pattern space.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An editing command with one address shall select each pattern space that matches the address.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An editing command with two addresses shall select the inclusive range from the first pattern space that matches the first address through the next pattern space that matches the second. (If the second address is a number less than or equal to the line number first selected, only one line shall be selected.) Starting at the first line following the selected range,  <i>sed</i> shall look again for the first address. Thereafter, the process shall be repeated. Omitting either or both of the address components in the following form produces undefined results:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<div class="subsection">
<h2>Regular Expressions in sed</h2> The  <i>sed</i> utility shall support the BREs described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, Section 9.3, Basic Regular Expressions, with the following additions:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
In a context address, the construction <b>&quot;\cBREc&quot;</b>, where <i>c</i> is any character other than backslash or &lt;newline&gt;, shall be identical to  <b>&quot;/BRE/&quot;</b> . If the character designated by  <i>c</i> appears following a backslash, then it shall be considered to be that literal character, which shall not terminate the BRE. For example, in the context address  <b>&quot;\xabc\xdefx&quot;</b>, the second <i>x</i> stands for itself, so that the BRE is  <b>&quot;abcxdef&quot;</b> .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
The escape sequence <b>'\n'</b> shall match a &lt;newline&gt; embedded in the pattern space. A literal &lt;newline&gt; shall not be used in the BRE of a context address or in the substitute function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
If an RE is empty (that is, no pattern is specified) <i>sed</i> shall behave as if the last RE used in the last command applied (either as an address or as part of a substitute command) was specified.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Editing Commands in sed</h2> In the following list of editing commands, the maximum number of permissible addresses for each function is indicated by [  <i>0addr</i>], [ <i>1addr</i>], or [ <i>2addr</i>], representing zero, one, or two addresses.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The argument <i>text</i> shall consist of one or more lines. Each embedded &lt;newline&gt; in the text shall be preceded by a backslash. Other backslashes in text shall be removed, and the following character shall be treated literally.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>r</b> and <b>w</b> command verbs, and the <i>w</i> flag to the  <b>s</b> command, take an optional <i>rfile</i> (or  <i>wfile</i>) parameter, separated from the command verb letter or flag by one or more &lt;blank&gt;s; implementations may allow zero separation as an extension.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The argument <i>rfile</i> or the argument <i>wfile</i> shall terminate the editing command. Each  <i>wfile</i> shall be created before processing begins. Implementations shall support at least ten  <i>wfile</i> arguments in the script; the actual number (greater than or equal to 10) that is supported by the implementation is unspecified. The use of the  <i>wfile</i> parameter shall cause that file to be initially created, if it does not exist, or shall replace the contents of an existing file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>t</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>y</b>, and <b>:</b> command verbs shall accept additional arguments. The following synopses indicate which arguments shall be separated from the command verbs by a single &lt;space&gt;.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>a</b> and <b>r</b> commands schedule text for later output. The text specified for the  <b>a</b> command, and the contents of the file specified for the  <b>r</b> command, shall be written to standard output just before the next attempt to fetch a line of input when executing the  <b>N</b> or <b>n</b> commands, or when reaching the end of the script. If written when reaching the end of the script, and the  <b>-n</b> option was not specified, the text shall be written after copying the pattern space to standard output. The contents of the file specified for the  <b>r</b> command shall be as of the time the output is written, not the time the  <b>r</b> command is applied. The text shall be output in the order in which the  <b>a</b> and <b>r</b> commands were applied to the input.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Command verbs other than <b>{</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>i</b>,  <b>r</b>, <b>t</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>:</b>, and <b>#</b> can be followed by a semicolon, optional &lt;blank&gt;s, and another command verb. However, when the  <b>s</b> command verb is used with the  <i>w</i> flag, following it with another command in this manner produces undefined results.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A function can be preceded by one or more <b>'!'</b> characters, in which case the function shall be applied if the addresses do not select the pattern space. Zero or more &lt;blank&gt;s shall be accepted before the first  <b>'!'</b> character. It is unspecified whether &lt;blank&gt;s can follow a  <b>'!'</b> character, and conforming applications shall not follow a  <b>'!'</b> character with &lt;blank&gt;s.<dl>

The functions can be preceded by &lt;blank&gt;s, but shall not be followed by &lt;blank&gt;s.

Substitute the replacement string for instances of the BRE in the pattern space. Any character other than backslash or &lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of a slash to delimit the BRE and the replacement. Within the BRE and the replacement, the BRE delimiter itself can be used as a literal character if it is preceded by a backslash.</dd>

The replacement string shall be scanned from beginning to end. An ampersand (  <b>'&amp;'</b> ) appearing in the replacement shall be replaced by the string matching the BRE. The special meaning of  <b>'&amp;'</b> in this context can be suppressed by preceding it by a backslash. The characters  <b>&quot;\</b><i>n&quot;</i>, where  <i>n</i> is a digit, shall be replaced by the text matched by the corresponding backreference expression. The special meaning of  <b>&quot;\</b><i>n&quot;</i> where <i>n</i> is a digit in this context, can be suppressed by preceding it by a backslash. For each other backslash (  <b>'\'</b> ) encountered, the following character shall lose its special meaning (if any).

<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> Regular expressions match entire strings, not just individual lines, but a &lt;newline&gt; is matched by  <b>'\n'</b> in a  <i>sed</i> RE; a &lt;newline&gt; is not allowed by the general definition of regular expression in IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001. Also note that  <b>'\n'</b> cannot be used to match a &lt;newline&gt; at the end of an arbitrary input line; &lt;newline&gt;s appear in the pattern space as a result of the  <b>N</b> editing command.</div>

<h1>RATIONALE</h1> This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 requires implementations to support at least ten distinct  <i>wfile</i>s, matching historical practice on many implementations. Implementations are encouraged to support more, but conforming applications should not exceed this limit.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The exit status codes specified here are different from those in System V. System V returns 2 for garbled  <i>sed</i> commands, but returns zero with its usage message or if the input file could not be opened. The standard developers considered this to be a bug.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The manner in which the <b>l</b> command writes non-printable characters was changed to avoid the historical backspace-overstrike method, and other requirements to achieve unambiguous output were added. See the RATIONALE for  <i>ed</i> for details of the format chosen, which is the same as that chosen for  <i>sed</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 requires implementations to provide pattern and hold spaces of at least 8192 bytes, larger than the 4000 bytes spaces used by some historical implementations, but less than the 20480 bytes limit used in an early proposal. Implementations are encouraged to allocate dynamically larger pattern and hold spaces as needed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The requirements for acceptance of &lt;blank&gt;s and &lt;space&gt;s in command lines has been made more explicit than in early proposals to describe clearly the historical practice and to remove confusion about the phrase &quot;protect initial blanks [ <i>sic</i>] and tabs from the stripping that is done on every script line&quot; that appears in much of the historical documentation of the  <i>sed</i> utility description of text. (Not all implementations are known to have stripped &lt;blank&gt;s from text lines, although they all have allowed leading &lt;blank&gt;s preceding the address on a command line.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The treatment of <b>'#'</b> comments differs from the SVID which only allows a comment as the first line of the script, but matches BSD-derived implementations. The comment character is treated as a command, and it has the same properties in terms of being accepted with leading &lt;blank&gt;s; the BSD implementation has historically supported this.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Early proposals required that a <i>script_file</i> have at least one non-comment line. Some historical implementations have behaved in unexpected ways if this were not the case. The standard developers considered that this was incorrect behavior and that application developers should not have to avoid this feature. A correct implementation of this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 shall permit  <i>script_file</i>s that consist only of comment lines.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Early proposals indicated that if <b>-e</b> and <b>-f</b> options were intermixed, all  <b>-e</b> options were processed before any  <b>-f</b> options. This has been changed to process them in the order presented because it matches historical practice and is more intuitive.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The treatment of the <b>p</b> flag to the <b>s</b> command differs between System V and BSD-based systems when the default output is suppressed. In the two examples:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
<b>echo a | sed    's/a/A/p'</b><br/>
<b>echo a | sed -n 's/a/A/p'</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001, BSD, System V documentation, and the SVID indicate that the first example should write two lines with  <b>A</b>, whereas the second should write one. Some System V systems write the  <b>A</b> only once in both examples because the  <b>p</b> flag is ignored if the <b>-n</b> option is not specified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This is a case of a diametrical difference between systems that could not be reconciled through the compromise of declaring the behavior to be unspecified. The SVID/BSD/System V documentation behavior was adopted for this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 because:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
No known documentation for any historic system describes the interaction between the  <b>p</b> flag and the <b>-n</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
The selected behavior is more correct as there is no technical justification for any interaction between the  <b>p</b> flag and the  <b>-n</b> option. A relationship between <b>-n</b> and the <b>p</b> flag might imply that they are only used together, but this ignores valid scripts that interrupt the cyclical nature of the processing through the use of the  <b>D</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>q</b>, or branching commands. Such scripts rely on the  <b>p</b> suffix to write the pattern space because they do not make use of the default output at the &quot;bottom&quot; of the script.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Because the <b>-n</b> option makes the <b>p</b> flag unnecessary, any interaction would only be useful if  <i>sed</i> scripts were written to run both with and without the  <b>-n</b> option. This is believed to be unlikely. It is even more unlikely that programmers have coded the  <b>p</b> flag expecting it to be unnecessary. Because the interaction was not documented, the likelihood of a programmer discovering the interaction and depending on it is further decreased.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Finally, scripts that break under the specified behavior produce too much output instead of too little, which is easier to diagnose and correct.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The form of the substitute command that uses the <b>n</b> suffix was limited to the first 512 matches in an early proposal. This limit has been removed because there is no reason an editor processing lines of {LINE_MAX} length should have this restriction. The command  <b>s/a/A/2047</b> should be able to substitute the 2047th occurrence of  <b>a</b> on a line.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>b</b>, <b>t</b>, and <b>:</b> commands are documented to ignore leading white space, but no mention is made of trailing white space. Historical implementations of  <i>sed</i> assigned different locations to the labels  <b>'x'</b> and  <b>&quot;x&#160;&quot;</b> . This is not useful, and leads to subtle programming errors, but it is historical practice, and changing it could theoretically break working scripts. Implementors are encouraged to provide warning messages about labels that are never used or jumps to labels that do not exist.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Historically, the <i>sed</i> <b>!</b> and <b>}</b> editing commands did not permit multiple commands on a single line using a semicolon as a command delimiter. Implementations are permitted, but not required, to support this extension.</div>
