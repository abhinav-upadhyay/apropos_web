<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>timer_gettime</i>() function shall store the amount of time until the specified timer,  <i>timerid</i>, expires and the reload value of the timer into the space pointed to by the  <i>value</i> argument. The  <i>it_value</i> member of this structure shall contain the amount of time before the timer expires, or zero if the timer is disarmed. This value is returned as the interval until timer expiration, even if the timer was armed with absolute time. The  <i>it_interval</i> member of <i>value</i> shall contain the reload value last set by  <i>timer_settime</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>timer_settime</i>() function shall set the time until the next expiration of the timer specified by  <i>timerid</i> from the  <i>it_value</i> member of the <i>value</i> argument and arm the timer if the  <i>it_value</i> member of <i>value</i> is non-zero. If the specified timer was already armed when  <i>timer_settime</i>() is called, this call shall reset the time until next expiration to the  <i>value</i> specified. If the <i>it_value</i> member of  <i>value</i> is zero, the timer shall be disarmed. The effect of disarming or resetting a timer with pending expiration notifications is unspecified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is not set in the argument <i>flags</i>,  <i>timer_settime</i>() shall behave as if the time until next expiration is set to be equal to the interval specified by the  <i>it_value</i> member of  <i>value</i>. That is, the timer shall expire in  <i>it_value</i> nanoseconds from when the call is made. If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is set in the argument  <i>flags</i>,  <i>timer_settime</i>() shall behave as if the time until next expiration is set to be equal to the difference between the absolute time specified by the  <i>it_value</i> member of <i>value</i> and the current value of the clock associated with  <i>timerid</i>. That is, the timer shall expire when the clock reaches the value specified by the  <i>it_value</i> member of <i>value</i>. If the specified time has already passed, the function shall succeed and the expiration notification shall be made.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The reload value of the timer shall be set to the value specified by the  <i>it_interval</i> member of <i>value</i>. When a timer is armed with a non-zero  <i>it_interval</i>, a periodic (or repetitive) timer is specified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Time values that are between two consecutive non-negative integer multiples of the resolution of the specified timer shall be rounded up to the larger multiple of the resolution. Quantization error shall not cause the timer to expire earlier than the rounded time value.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the argument <i>ovalue</i> is not NULL, the <i>timer_settime</i>() function shall store, in the location referenced by  <i>ovalue</i>, a value representing the previous amount of time before the timer would have expired, or zero if the timer was disarmed, together with the previous timer reload value. Timers shall not expire before their scheduled time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Only a single signal shall be queued to the process for a given timer at any point in time. When a timer for which a signal is still pending expires, no signal shall be queued, and a timer overrun shall occur.  When a timer expiration signal is delivered to or accepted by a process, if the implementation supports the Realtime Signals Extension, the  <i>timer_getoverrun</i>() function shall return the timer expiration overrun count for the specified timer. The overrun count returned contains the number of extra timer expirations that occurred between the time the signal was generated (queued) and when it was delivered or accepted, up to but not including an implementation-defined maximum of {DELAYTIMER_MAX}. If the number of such extra expirations is greater than or equal to {DELAYTIMER_MAX}, then the overrun count shall be set to {DELAYTIMER_MAX}. The value returned by  <i>timer_getoverrun</i>() shall apply to the most recent expiration signal delivery or acceptance for the timer.  If no expiration signal has been delivered for the timer, or if the Realtime Signals Extension is not supported, the return value of  <i>timer_getoverrun</i>() is unspecified.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> If the  <i>timer_getoverrun</i>() function succeeds, it shall return the timer expiration overrun count as explained above.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <i>timer_gettime</i>() or <i>timer_settime</i>() functions succeed, a value of 0 shall be returned.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If an error occurs for any of these functions, the value -1 shall be returned, and  <i>errno</i> set to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">

<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> Practical clocks tick at a finite rate, with rates of 100 hertz and 1000 hertz being common. The inverse of this tick rate is the clock resolution, also called the clock granularity, which in either case is expressed as a time duration, being 10 milliseconds and 1 millisecond respectively for these common rates. The granularity of practical clocks implies that if one reads a given clock twice in rapid succession, one may get the same time value twice; and that timers must wait for the next clock tick after the theoretical expiration time, to ensure that a timer never returns too soon. Note also that the granularity of the clock may be significantly coarser than the resolution of the data format used to set and get time and interval values. Also note that some implementations may choose to adjust time and/or interval values to exactly match the ticks of the underlying clock.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 defines functions that allow an application to determine the implementation-supported resolution for the clocks and requires an implementation to document the resolution supported for timers and  <i>nanosleep</i>() if they differ from the supported clock resolution. This is more of a procurement issue than a runtime application issue.</div>
