<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() except that if none of the signals specified by  <i>set</i> are pending, <i>sigtimedwait</i>() shall wait for the time interval specified in the  <b>timespec</b> structure referenced by  <i>timeout</i>. If the <b>timespec</b> structure pointed to by  <i>timeout</i> is zero-valued and if none of the signals specified by  <i>set</i> are pending, then <i>sigtimedwait</i>() shall return immediately with an error. If  <i>timeout</i> is the NULL pointer, the behavior is unspecified.  If the Monotonic Clock option is supported, the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock shall be used to measure the time interval specified by the  <i>timeout</i> argument.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function selects the pending signal from the set specified by  <i>set</i>. Should any of multiple pending signals in the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX be selected, it shall be the lowest numbered one. The selection order between realtime and non-realtime signals, or between multiple pending non-realtime signals, is unspecified. If no signal in  <i>set</i> is pending at the time of the call, the calling thread shall be suspended until one or more signals in  <i>set</i> become pending or until it is interrupted by an unblocked, caught signal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>sigwait</i>() function if the  <i>info</i> argument is NULL. If the <i>info</i> argument is non-NULL, the  <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function shall be equivalent to  <i>sigwait</i>(), except that the selected signal number shall be stored in the  <i>si_signo</i> member, and the cause of the signal shall be stored in the  <i>si_code</i> member. If any value is queued to the selected signal, the first such queued value shall be dequeued and, if the  <i>info</i> argument is non-NULL, the value shall be stored in the  <i>si_value</i> member of <i>info</i>. The system resource used to queue the signal shall be released and returned to the system for other use. If no value is queued, the content of the  <i>si_value</i> member is undefined. If no further signals are queued for the selected signal, the pending indication for that signal shall be reset.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion (that is, one of the signals specified by  <i>set</i> is pending or is generated) <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() and  <i>sigtimedwait</i>() shall return the selected signal number. Otherwise, the function shall return a value of -1 and set  <i>errno</i> to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function shall fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b></dt>
<dd>
No signal specified by <i>set</i> was generated within the specified timeout period.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() and <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() functions may fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINTR</b></dt>
<dd>
The wait was interrupted by an unblocked, caught signal. It shall be documented in system documentation whether this error causes these functions to fail.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function may also fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
The <i>timeout</i> argument specified a <i>tv_nsec</i> value less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
An implementation only checks for this error if no signal is pending in  <i>set</i> and it is necessary to wait.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> The  <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function times out and returns an [EAGAIN] error. Application writers should note that this is inconsistent with other functions such as  <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() that return [ETIMEDOUT].</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> Existing programming practice on realtime systems uses the ability to pause waiting for a selected set of events and handle the first event that occurs in-line instead of in a signal-handling function. This allows applications to be written in an event-directed style similar to a state machine. This style of programming is useful for largescale transaction processing in which the overall throughput of an application and the ability to clearly track states are more important than the ability to minimize the response time of individual event handling.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It is possible to construct a signal-waiting macro function out of the realtime signal function mechanism defined in this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001. However, such a macro has to include the definition of a generalized handler for all signals to be waited on. A significant portion of the overhead of handler processing can be avoided if the signal-waiting function is provided by the kernel. This volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001 therefore provides two signal-waiting functions-one that waits indefinitely and one with a timeout-as part of the overall realtime signal function specification.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The specification of a function with a timeout allows an application to be written that can be broken out of a wait after a set period of time if no event has occurred. It was argued that setting a timer event before the wait and recognizing the timer event in the wait would also implement the same functionality, but at a lower performance level. Because of the performance degradation associated with the user-level specification of a timer event and the subsequent cancellation of that timer event after the wait completes for a valid event, and the complexity associated with handling potential race conditions associated with the user-level method, the separate function has been included.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that the semantics of the <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function are nearly identical to that of the  <i>sigwait</i>() function defined by this volume of IEEE&#160;Std&#160;1003.1-2001. The only difference is that  <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() returns the queued signal value in the  <i>value</i> argument. The return of the queued value is required so that applications can differentiate between multiple events queued to the same signal number.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The two distinct functions are being maintained because some implementations may choose to implement the POSIX Threads Extension functions and not implement the queued signals extensions. Note, though, that  <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() does not return the queued value if the  <i>value</i> argument is NULL, so the POSIX Threads Extension  <i>sigwait</i>() function can be implemented as a macro on  <i>sigwaitinfo</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function was separated from the <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function to address concerns regarding the overloading of the  <i>timeout</i> pointer to indicate indefinite wait (no timeout), timed wait, and immediate return, and concerns regarding consistency with other functions where the conditional and timed waits were separate functions from the pure blocking function. The semantics of  <i>sigtimedwait</i>() are specified such that  <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() could be implemented as a macro with a NULL pointer for  <i>timeout</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>sigwait</i> functions provide a synchronous mechanism for threads to wait for asynchronously-generated signals. One important question was how many threads that are suspended in a call to a  <i>sigwait</i>() function for a signal should return from the call when the signal is sent. Four choices were considered:<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
Return an error for multiple simultaneous calls to <i>sigwait</i> functions for the same signal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
One or more threads return.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 3.</dt>
<dd>
All waiting threads return.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 4.</dt>
<dd>
Exactly one thread returns.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Prohibiting multiple calls to <i>sigwait</i>() for the same signal was felt to be overly restrictive. The &quot;one or more&quot; behavior made implementation of conforming packages easy at the expense of forcing POSIX threads clients to protect against multiple simultaneous calls to  <i>sigwait</i>() in application code in order to achieve predictable behavior. There was concern that the &quot;all waiting threads&quot; behavior would result in &quot;signal broadcast storms&quot;, consuming excessive CPU resources by replicating the signals in the general case. Furthermore, no convincing examples could be presented that delivery to all was either simpler or more powerful than delivery to one.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Thus, the consensus was that exactly one thread that was suspended in a call to a  <i>sigwait</i> function for a signal should return when that signal occurs. This is not an onerous restriction as:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
A multi-way signal wait can be built from the single-way wait.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Signals should only be handled by application-level code, as library routines cannot guess what the application wants to do with signals generated for the entire process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Applications can thus arrange for a single thread to wait for any given signal and call any needed routines upon its arrival.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In an application that is using signals for interprocess communication, signal processing is typically done in one place. Alternatively, if the signal is being caught so that process cleanup can be done, the signal handler thread can call separate process cleanup routines for each portion of the application. Since the application main line started each portion of the application, it is at the right abstraction level to tell each portion of the application to clean up.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Certainly, there exist programming styles where it is logical to consider waiting for a single signal in multiple threads. A simple  <i>sigwait_multiple</i>() routine can be constructed to achieve this goal. A possible implementation would be to have each  <i>sigwait_multiple</i>() caller registered as having expressed interest in a set of signals. The caller then waits on a thread-specific condition variable. A single server thread calls a  <i>sigwait</i>() function on the union of all registered signals. When the  <i>sigwait</i>() function returns, the appropriate state is set and condition variables are broadcast. New  <i>sigwait_multiple</i>() callers may cause the pending  <i>sigwait</i>() call to be canceled and reissued in order to update the set of signals being waited for.</div>
